Blowers complain about President Trump's contact with a foreign leader. Had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine. Like I mean perfect. Today I'm announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. It is our great pleasure to welcome the president. United States Donald Trump calling in Mr Trump. Good morning. Good morning. It's Julie Davis in the Washington Bureau of The New York Times. The latest is that after two weeks of public impeachment hearings, President Trump had a lot to get off his chest. Good to have you on Fox and Friends today. Uh, as you said in your tweet. Another slow news week one by one. Okay, first of all, loca, I don't know him. He's trying to discredit the witnesses in the inquiry so far. Kurt. Volker don't know him. Uh, this guy Sunlen hardly know him. I've had a couple of conversations with him. I see him hanging around. You know what? I go to Europe. Gordon Sandlin. Look, the ambassador. The woman Re Ivanovich she wouldn't even put up. She's an Obama person, you know. But I said, why are you being so kind. Well, so she's a woman. We have to be nice. David Holmes. How about the guy with the telephone? How about that one? I guarantee that never took place, He said He's sitting there listening to me, and he gave kind of a preview of what the Republican and Peter response will be and what his reaction is going to be as this whole thing unfold. Ah, lot of it had to do. They say, What? Ukraine? Which is that everything the president did he did because of corruption in Ukraine. He did, because he essentially was the victim of this scheme that Ukraine was trying to pull off. But Mr Person interesting. It's very interesting. They have the server right from the DNC Democratic National Committee. Who has the circle? The FBI went in and they told him, Get out of here. You're not kidding. We're not giving it to you. They gave the server to Crowdstrike, or whatever it's called, which is a country which is a company owned by very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server. You know, the FBI has never gotten that server. That's a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company, where you sure they did that? In short, he's saying that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind interference in the 2016 election. So why wouldn't he re evaluate or question or ask Ukraine to investigate? And why wouldn't he be skeptical of having a White House meeting or sending hundreds of millions of dollars in American military assistance money to Ukraine? Are you sure they gave it to Ukraine? Well, that's what the word is. That's what I asked actually in my phone call. And you know, I mean, I asked it very point black, because we're looking for corruption. So this is interesting because, of course, just yesterday in the final day of the impeachment hearings of the week, as Democrats are kind of wrapping up their public case and getting ready to sort of sum it up in a big report for the public, their witness, Fiona Hill, who was the top Europe and Russia expert at the National Security Council, almost seemed to anticipate this. Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security service's did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps somehow for some reason, you craned it. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security service's themselves. She told Republicans in the room. This idea that Ukraine influenced the election, this idea that it was Ukraine that meddled and not Russia. It's fiction. The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. I say this not as an alarmist but as a realist and the cost of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advanced Russian interests. Thes fictions are harmful, even if they're deployed for purely domestic political purposes. Not only is it fiction, but it's fiction that is essentially a Russian disinformation campaign that is designed to interfere with American democracy. Right now, Russia's security service is on. Their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election. We're running out of time to stop them and you know, The Times reported this afternoon that Fiona Hill's testimony ah, lines with information that the American intelligence community has actually been sharing with senators in recent weeks and telling them over the last couple of weeks that they've discovered that Russia for years has tried to frame you Crane as the nation behind the 2016 hacking to say that it wasn't us, it was Ukraine that framed us. But based on what we saw on TV this morning, it seems like this is going to be central to the president's impeachment defense. He's not dismissing. This is a conspiracy theory. He's embracing this as kind of the core of his own defense in the impeachment case, and furthermore, frankly, I want to try. You know, I could think I could have it. You want to try what Everyone? Oh, I would. But we're starting to see signs that this is also the story we're gonna be hearing in the Senate once the House more likely than not votes to impeach Trump in the coming weeks, sending things to a trial in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. Lindsey Graham, who is the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, wrote to the State Department this week asking for documents about Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of this Ukrainian energy company, their contact with the former Ukrainian president, the context that other members of the Obama administration had with Ukrainians in the past. It's all a sign that he's going to try to lay out in hearings some sort of alternate narrative to what the Democrats have been presenting in the House. And it looks like that's the same narrative the president was promoting today and that Fiona Hill and American intelligence officials have been warning about. I'm not a doctor, But if I was writing a prescription, calling in every week to update the country about what's happening might be good for your health, that's something to consider. You have the phone number, you know that. I've been doing it for years. Remember group with your group? I've been doing it for stress release. It was up to me, and it is up to me and we'll do it more often. But I have a lot of fun doing it, and you know what? The nice part we get? We get the true word out, and that's the latest. We'll be back when things pick up after Congress is holiday break. Sometimes a single moment can change everything. I used to stay up late at night with my dad watching movies on TV, and one night he cried. Um, Alicia Burke, host of the new podcast that made all the difference. I talked to achievers like documentary filmmaker Ken Burns about the moments that inspired them to make an impact. I knew that there was some power to film that I wanted to be a part of you confined that made all the difference Anywhere you get your podcasts created by Bank of America, what would you like the power to d'oh!"

He was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this. And he said, You know, when anybody here ever want to be president or wantto run for office Seeing what a mess and one ugly place Washington wasn't it? I just may be involuntarily. My hand went up, and from then on it became the running joke, the class that I'd wind up running for president. Then, by the time I got to college, I had this institute of politics at Harvard, and every day they would be a different speakers would come through. Remember when I was there is a freshman people like Donna Brazile, who would just come off managing the Gore campaign, and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain and the former president of Ecuador. He'd been deposed in a coup. You just kind of hang around and watch him and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they're just people, these people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but there they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that on some level I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office. Or you could be an out gay person. Not both. Please, not where I was from. From the New York Times Unlikable Borrow This is the daily I am running my candidacy for president in our series on the pivotal moments in the lives of the top four Democratic candidates for president. I'm running for president and I'm running for president, president of the United States today. I'm a proud son of South Bend, Indiana, and I am running for president. It's Friday, November 22nd. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for the times, and you've been closely tracking Mayor Buddha. Judge in In order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we're trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buddha judge, what moment should be focused on. Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography, is very central to his appeal to voters, and he's got a great story to tell. He's been elected mayor of this medium sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He's been a Rhodes scholar. He's worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He's going off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you're a voter, wow, he really stands out. There's something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret the secret that he couldn't confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically, since he went away to college and decided, Hey, you know I can run for president and he doesn't see how it's possible for the politician with the perfect background. The perfect resume toe also be open about their sexuality in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment. Welcome to the studio. Thank you. You're gonna sit there. So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana, where Peter Buddha judge is born. Mayor. Tell me about the kind of kid that you were going up in Indiana. Well, I think I was safe to say well on the nerdy side lived in ah, neighborhood kind of middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you'd call a prototypical Midwestern kids upbringing. You know, playing in the park with friends. A lot of time in the house. It was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them that I was in in baseball, I think loved science and science fiction loved reading. Plus, I was an only child. So I think it's safe to say I had ah lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was dog and my parents who were both academics and me. What was your introduction to even the idea of politics? Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate, they're really cared about what was happening. I remember the Democratic convention. It must have been 1988. NBC News Continues Its coverage of America's convention's been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech, but I look out at this convention. I see the face of America red, yellow, brown, black and white. We all precious in God's sight. The Rial Rainbow Coalition. And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican convention to I mean, you would stop. You know, I don't think I ever crossed their mind to ever vote for Republican. Get out. Now let's go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention. Everything in the house would kind of stop, and it was time to watch what was playing out. Thank you. And what moment and this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating. Two feeling really drawn to it. Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats at the time. It's crazy to think about now, polarized as we are, but would have felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center right and center left, both of them very committed to growth and and business. But but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there's a moment for any kind of well spoken or intelligent young person watching the news. When you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, Well, that's not right. I could do that. I could do it different now you might be wrong. You think they might be way more sophisticated than you are and you can't see it or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they're saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom are extremely impressive but, uh, none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just so at this point, you're too into Harvard. Have you made up your mind? You're probably going to find a way tohave a career in politics. I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don't think I'd figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name and I was, ah, Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running, but I think it's safe to say, By the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it. Well, I wanna talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact that the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay and so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you? I think it depends what you mean by a realization. Right there. Things you could point to going way back. Certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12. That, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush, but I was not willing to think of it that although some part of me must have. I mean, I wasn't stupid either. Right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there By the time I was I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind. Well, what did you do with those feelings? I guess I packed him up. Yeah. Packed amount. Much would be the best dancer. Back him up and put him where? I don't know. I don't know how these things work even in your own mind. I just didn't explore them, that's for sure. First of all, they're not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such. Growing up, I mean in high school is exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life for a gay community. And when I got to college, that's when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up. Why? I think because you just can't escape it. I mean, thank God you're in college, right, Nina? Any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it's a big part of what you spend college on, right? So how did you deal with it? Same way I dealt with it up to them, just packed it away, Stated women remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships. I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn't the same as, uh, what it was to be in love with somebody. And your political ambition was already solid at that point. Yeah, I still didn't know exactly where would take me or what it would mean, But I think by then I knew that there was a good chance I was gonna be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I'm still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing that maybe I'm straight or I'm bisexual. I just not worry about the gay part. I think what I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future, how is gonna be involved? I wasn't even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I'm sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was very least different and as became increasingly clear gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was a simple fact that that didn't fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life not just ah career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I don't have kids. From my perspective. You could be married and have kids, or you could be get both. You graduate in 2004 That wrong? That's the year when Massachusetts legalizes gay marriage. Yes, The court today is, you know, in a 43 advisory opinion to the Senate has ruled that in the November 18th 2003 decision they meant manage, they meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny, manage right to same sex couples. So I say that on Lee to try to understand, Are you falling behind the culture? In a sense, are you ignoring some of the signs that these things were changing? Midge and only Midge will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution. Well, thing is, I wasn't from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And, ah, nothing against Massachusetts. But I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn't belong there, either. Um, why not? It was just It was just a different culture. I didn't realize that. I didn't realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest and just little things. Cultural things, the way I don't know the way people interact What's expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially I was way more Midwestern than I thought. So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy reserves, so it starts with 9 11 actually starts before 9 11 There's this family tradition of serving in the military. There's a painting hanging on the wall of my parent's house of a relative, a great uncle who kind of idolized in theory. Hey was an Army Air Corps pilot, and so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea of being in the military, and then it never really became riel. But I remember on 9 11 thinking, Oh, war isn't just a thing that happens in other places where in other periods of history, like war has come to my generation to and thinking, at least in the back of my head that that might mean I would be involved but not taking any steps to do with it. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when, when some friends of mine start to serve a friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve was fascinated, and then when I I was talking thio someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service. And she's a faculty member whose giving advice to students and just said pointedly like You might wantto really think about how you're going to say that knowing that you're gonna be competing against people from the military academies. Oh, yeah, that's true. Like my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller, held up against what others air doing. Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service? Knowing that that to get a roads to be in that world in that league, you know, it might be a good thing, I think definitely that it was part of how your fruit to, ah, culture of service and also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over the certainly the Kennedy School. As you might imagine, that can't be separated from his military career. I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would've served up until roughly the time when I came of age, when everything shifted an expectation that you would serve Uh, well when you're looking at the history of you know, the people we were studying. Ah, President made history. Yeah, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top of this experience, knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college. We went out, We took a week off and rented a car. And it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like anytime I met a young, especially a young man. It was somebody who was serving or was about to surf and starting to realize here you had service. That used to be something that bridge people together now is completely different. That if you were rural or low income, you were highly likely to serve if you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically. But I'd had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard. Almost nobody with that background was serving, and I began to feel like it wasn't just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn't got round to is that I was part of a problem. I was part of a divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready, tow, Yank, open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, Hey, how do I sign up? I wonder, Do you think you join the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career? You know, I wrestle with that because this is I get that question. There's a part of me that thinks if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn't pure in some way? And I remember the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today. Popular What? I still do it, and I want to believe the answer is yes. But there's no way to go back and prove it. I'm not somebody who thinks that it's like a prerequisite that if you want to run for office, you need to have served. But I do think you have a heart for elected office. One way to put your money where your mouth is is to have been in that kind of service to you. That strikes me as a very candid answer because, of course, you could just say, Well, of course I would have done it even if there was no possible political benefit. And I want to say that I just can't prove it, Huh? So I want to talk about this Run from air for just a little bit. Whenever you want for office, your character is on display, and at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself. Secret? Did it feel like you're hiding something? Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating. Then I would crack a joke or something. We'd be sitting in a studio like this one, and a radio host would ask a question. And I'd say, Well, if anybody listening is in the economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out. Just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, um, except for the fact that it wasn't actively looking for love, us going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody had a straight up asked me on the record to this day, I'm not sure what I would have done. Do you think that that would have potentially cost you? The mayoralty would have kept you from being mayor Staying mayor? Yeah, I think there's a good chance of that. There's a reason why. No, as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana. This is a state with strong Christian values and not known for progressive, social, uh, outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up 29 years old, saying, Trust me, Support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who's the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or ah, vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all. So I want to now move into this notion of you reconcile in these things. Yes. So when I first joined the reserve that the message was kind of your pretty much gonna goto one of these wars and we'll let you know which one. And so I knew that a certain point. It was coming and of course I didn't want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gained it out with my team. If I get orders, here's what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don't think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right. I'm the hardest thing for people who deploy is the fact that you're leaving behind somebody you love in addition to all the professional complications. But then the more I I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that that I didn't have Ah ah, I wasn't coming back to ah family. My parents, of course, but I wasn't coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I'm here I am. I'm a grown ass man. I own a home of the mayor of my city. I'm a military officer and If I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it's like to be in love and that just maybe realize how untenable this situation I was in real Iwas. And up until then, it didn't seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy and I might have differed coming out and having a dating life forever. If not for this moment where I'm thinking should I could die. You were the letter I want to ask you about. Yeah. Ah, you know, it's the thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don't know. Um, but it's the thing you do when you go to war. You want to make sure that you have the last word on ah on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer would have been pretty easy to find if if worse came to worst on. Ah, and that's a real moment, too, because you're sitting there staring at the screen, trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life and What did you say? Well, what I said was that I wouldn't want people to think that I'd been cheated. That obviously be terrible if I didn't come back. But I'll say this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to d'oh, let alone at my age and that I'd had this very fulfilling life and of course, would be, ah, be too bad if something happen to me. But but to keep that in perspective. But if you're asking if there was like P s, I'm gay. No, that's kind of so you're unemployed. You do not die, but you come back and your mayor And how do you decide that it's time to come out? Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it's just was more how and when remember resenting the idea that you're supposed toe have to come out right straight. People don't have to come out. What do I And then, while I'm in the process of figuring this out Thank you all for coming. It's been a tough week here in the Hoosier State, but we're gonna move forward. We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the governor, Mike Pence in his so called religious Freedom bill. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination. So suddenly we're on national television, my state as the most officially anti gay state in the country. Look, everybody supports religious freedom. Certainly everybody in South Bend, including me. What this bill has done is send exactly the wrong message about what kind of state we are. And I don't want people thinking when they first think of South Bender, they think of Indiana about discrimination. I want them thinking about everything that's good here. I'm fighting him on it, of course, because it's a terrible policy. But now I'm fighting this terrible anti gay policy, putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I'm more effective because people don't know that I'm gay and at the same time knowing that that this just kind of speeds things up even more. That, like, is just a really weird position to be in to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that that soon the Supreme Court's gonna weigh in on marriage. When all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I'm wrestling with how to do this. And so, oddly enough, it was another military experience. I had my two weeks a year that you do when you're in the reserve. I went off to training, and if you're as busy as a ZAY was his mayor, military duty actually felt like kind of a almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn't used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and and write and think and call friends and get advice. So you produce a plan? Yeah, well, I produced a letter and op ed, I guess. What was the essential line? You know, I'm sure you remember that you wrote, um I remember saying that it's just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job the way I do. My did my job. Either as an officer is a mayor or in business had nothing do with the fact that I was getting on dhe that it still sounds a little defensive. Yeah, um or maybe a little scared. Probably. Yeah. I mean, ah, you know, I didn't feel like I was coming out guns blazing. And I felt like I again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did. I'm not just in my own life that my main agenda was personally, I want to get out there and start dating, but also, that would mean something.

In an essay published in today's South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buddha judge penned an essay in Tuesday's South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement. Now it comes just months after the state's religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says, nothing is different, Nothing has changed and his focus is on South Bend. I want to talk about the timing of the exact moment of the up, because my sense is that at this phase of your career, your up for re election right, you've won the primary and winning the primary in a sense, means you're you're standing a very good shot of winning, depending on the year. But yeah, in South Bend, it should be. So does that mean you deliberately chose a like, a safe, low risk? Time to do this? I don't know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there's no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have. So once you come on, how does your personal life change? Well, I started dating, and it kind of changes everything. I'm gonna sell it this very demanding job. You're the mayor. And so anybody in town that you ask toe like have a cup of coffee is it's a thing. Yeah, it's a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it's not like a very healthy pool what I'm saying. And I remember thinking there were all these all these kind of city fathers who early on my time is mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I was just thinking like, Where are you now? Like did none of you have like a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. It turns out there's APS for all of this. There was OK, Cupid Tender, the one that actually came through for me was called a hinge. And it's supposed to serve up people that I don't know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile and, ah, like I want to know this guy. So start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously he's the one I remember because that was Justin. You feed your husband? Yes. So your story too many people is a particularly compelling when everything we've just discussed you are a Harvard graduate Rhodes scholar. You're a veteran, you're gay, you're religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing to some degree to run for president for a very long time. Even though you're quite young. And I'm sure you understand that I have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of perhaps orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that no matter what your intention is could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine? Yeah, I think we're condition to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don't view myself that way. Although I get that that that story has been written around me. Although I also don't know what it is we expect. Like that somebody can get struck by lightning and then and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right that they bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about this story that you tell about yourself at the end of the day. I'm not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office. Were to be the president. I'm not coming in. The presidency is a thing that I'd liketo occupy. I'm coming out is this way to do something that I think I'm able to d'oh. And I think it's helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that that helps prepare me to do what's required toe to do this. And this is advice. I give talking to students, too. You imagine somebody's being sworn in an ambitious, talented person, kind of the middle of their career, is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East and then imagine if if that person has got there one of two ways in kind of universe. A. It's a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and ah and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said my woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States of force toward peace in the Middle East. They don't know what that's gonna mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist, or maybe they're in academic. Or maybe they're, ah, civil servant or whatever, but by whatever winding path they wind up in this job. All right, which of those two scenarios is gonna lead to somebody who's better equipped to take that job? They've been handed, and I got to think it's the latter. And so what I've tried to do in my life is Thio prepare myself to be useful to others. Ah, and yes, I think that in all likelihood means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office, or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it's not about necessarily having one title or another. And so I think if you over think it, that's where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you've been chasing for a long time. Jimmy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete? Booted about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would in danger, that ambition. I think we learned a lot about his decision making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he's been very intentional along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long term political career. Now some people would think on the one hand, that's too calculating. I don't want somebody who's thought about being president since he was a teenager. And you know, in the era when voters seem to prise authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made toe wait seems to have borne out to his benefit here. He is the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States, who has a legitimate shot at being his party's nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary. Right now. He's rocketed to the top of the polls. He's brought in all this money, in large part because he's gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He's heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won't know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one's cast a single vote, and we don't know how voters in the Democratic primary going to react way certainly don't know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we're just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say. When you think back to your younger self not just your teenage self but even your college self in your post college itself, who is so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish? You could tell that person that version of mayor, but it is well, back then, I would have thought this other fact if I dared to unpack it. This fact about my life this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero in terms of the impact I was gonna have in the world that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn't get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of things I'm seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point when actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most. It's a strange thing to think about that. The one thing that I couldn't control, the one thing that might have meant, that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purposes. Entire campaign. Thank you very much. Back West Side story is an explosion of every imaginable idea of what a musical can be, says New York magazine.

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, v. Ona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Cordon Soften as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump. He was being involved in a domestic political errant, and we were being involved in national security. Foreign policy on those two things had just divert. Hill testified that when Trump in solid press Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that you cream interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia's hands. Since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security service's themselves. Thes fictions are harmful even if they're deployed for purely domestic political purposes and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was indicted on charges of bribery and fraud after a long running corruption investigation, throwing his political future into doubt at a moment when neither he nor his chief rival have been able to form a governing coalition. Charges involve allegations that Netanyahu accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts in return for political favors and performed favors for Israeli media tycoons in exchange for favorable news coverage.

e847d671-7d68-42ea-91ab-c2515a9f0a66,The Latest: The Irregular Channel,"<p>Throughout the impeachment inquiry, an image has surfaced of the Trump administration’s two policymaking channels on Ukraine — one regular, one not. Today’s testimony from Fiona Hill, President Trump’s former top adviser on Russia and Europe, raised the question: Which was which?</p><p><em>“The Latest” is a new series on the impeachment inquiry, from the team behind “The Daily.” You can find more information about it&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/podcasts/the-latest-impeachment-fiona-hill-gordon-sondland.html"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>","Thu, 21 Nov 2019 23:11:45 -0000",https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/rss.art19.com/episodes/74f0576d-d1d0-4a9c-ba82-b1cc49a4c1a0.mp3,"it just started with a whistle. Blowers complain about President Trump's contact with a foreign leader. Had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine. Like I mean perfect. Today I'm announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment in court. I have no interest in announcing outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction except about the truth. It's Mike Schmidt in the Washington bureau of the New York Times, as we've talked about before, the whole point of these hearings for the Democrats is to create an ah ha moment for the American public, a moment that would help build support for impeachment. But the latest is that what we saw today is that there are also ah ha moments happening for the players in this story. Um, is the microphone on? I believe it is now is perfect that as the witnesses were watching each other testifying, they themselves are coming to understand what was going on around them during this saga, major things that they did not fully understand in the moment. Thank you again, Mr Chairman, Mr. Chairman, ranking member newness and members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to testify before you today, I have a short opening statement. So today's witness was Fiona Hill, one of the top national security officials dealing with Ukraine. I take great pride in the fact that I'm a non parties on foreign policy expert. It was served under three Republican and Democratic presidents. She was part of team normal government foreign policy, meaning she was very upset when characters like Re Giuliani and specifically Gordon Sandlin, the trump donor turned you ambassador that we heard from yesterday, showed up and basically started doing her job. Very unfortunate. Hide a bit of a blow up with Ambassador Sunland, and I had a couple of testy encounters with him. One of those was in June 18 when I actually said to him, Who put you in charge of Ukraine? And I'll admit I was a bit rude on. That's when he told me the president would shut me up. She's saying that at the time she experienced Gordon Sandlin is this kind of rogue agent. Is someone operating outside the normal channels of government? I had to say, but often when women show anger, it's not fully appreciated. It's often, you know, pushed onto emotional issues, perhaps, or deflected onto other people on What I was angry about was that he wasn't coordinating with us. So I was upset with him that he wasn't fully telling us about all of the meetings that he was having. And he said to me, But I'm briefing the president. I'm breeding chief of stuff Mulvaney. I'm briefing Secretary Palm Pill and I've talked to Ambassador Bolton. Who else do I have to deal with? And he's telling her at the time, I'm telling everyone who needs to know. The point is we have a robust into agency process that deals with Ukraine. It includes Mr Holmes that includes Ambassador Taylor's. The Sharjah in Ukraine is includes a whole load of other people, but she's not getting it. She thinks that he's hiding things from her, that he's not telling other diplomats that he's just off on his own, having his own policy. It's on Lee when someone starts to testify yesterday that she realizes. But it struck me one yesterday when you put up on the screen ambassador's son Lindsey, males on who was on these e mails, and he said these the people who need to know that he was absolutely right. Her anger, it's online, was misplaced and kind of missed. The point from Sahlins perspective. He's the normal channel. There's nothing irregular about it. He's just doing what the president told him because he was being involved in a domestic political errand and we were being involved in national security. Foreign policy on those two things had just diverged, so he waas correct, and I had not put my finger on the out that at the moment. But I was irritated with him, and I did say to him, I'm busted a Sunland garden. I think this is all going to blow up and here we are, So it's pretty remarkable. In her testimony today, Fiona Hill is saying that as she watched Gordon someone testify yesterday she realized that Fiona Hill and the other career diplomats they were the ones who were on the outside looking in. They had become the irregular channels, and it was at that moment that I started to realize how those things that diverged and I realized in fact that I wasn't really being fair to him, busted a Sunland because he was carrying out what he thought he had been instructed to carry out, and we were doing something that we thought was just a CZ, perhaps even more important, but it wasn't in the same channel. So what sort of this incredible image you have all these characters in this drama. Some of them have worked closely alongside one another. Some of them briefly intersected some of never even actually met before. But they're now forever linked because they're witnesses in this impeachment inquiry. And what we saw, at least today, is that by bringing them all together in this forum, they're learning about their own shared story at the same time than Americans air learning about it themselves. It speaks to the complexity of this whole thing. If we're finding it hard to understand, we should be humbled by the fact that so are the people who were there. So that's the latest. Sometimes a single moment can change everything. I used to stay up late at night with my dad watching movies on TV, and one night he cried, Um, Alicia Burke, host of the new podcast that made all the difference. I talked to achievers like documentary filmmaker Ken Burns about the moments that inspired them to make an impact. I knew that there was some power to film that I wanted to be a part of you confined that made all the difference Anywhere you get your podcasts created by Bank of America. What would you like the power to d'oh!"

Unlikable borrow. This is daily. Gordon is a trump donor turned you ambassador turned witness in the impeachment inquiry, whose testimony has been contradicted on multiple occasions today how both Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee chooses to handle their most complicated witness today. It's Thursday, November 21st. Give us a sense of what it felt like to be in that room this morning, as the committee prepared to hear from. Gordon saw on this very complicated with us. So we knew that in the middle of this jam packed week of impeachment testimony, Gordon someone's appearance was going to be something different. Nick Van Does was in the capital for someone's testimony. Sunlen has really been described by almost everybody as having been in the middle of this pressure campaign on Ukraine this summer. Now there was particular anticipation because someone's story, unlike some other witnesses, has evolved as time has gone on. So when he first came in and spoke in private with investigators in October, he was pretty unclear about whether or not the president was trying to leverage White House meeting or security aide for Ukraine to get the investigations that he wanted. He told them repeatedly. I can't remember this. I can't remember that. Well, after that happened, someone submitted a supplement to his testimony in writing up. Do that instead. Actually, I do think there was a quid pro quo. And so there was a lot of anticipation heading into his testimony as to which Gordon someone would show up. What story was he going to tell us? You're gonna copped all these different things? How is he gonna treat the president has you gonna treat his own evolving story? And it really felt like it could go either way. So what happens? How does this much anticipated hearing again? Show a little after nine o'clock Gordon, someone walks into the same grand hearing room where all the impeachment hearings have been taking place. Chairman Shift dropped his counter. And then, after taking an oath to tell the truth and nothing but the truth so help you God, someone sits down and begins reading from a pretty thick stack of papers and opening statement that he's brought with him. And he starts by saying that I have not had access to all of my phone records. State department e mails and many, many other State Department documents. His job is made more difficult by the fact that he has not been allowed to go back to the State Department look, ATT notes or records that might be able to fill in his recollections. Having access would have been very helpful to me and trying to reconstruct, with whom I spoke unmet and when and what was set seems to be a nod at the fact that his story is in the most generous sense evolving. And he begins to tell the story about his involvement with Ukraine policy. Over the last say, five or six months, the U. S delegation developed a very positive view of the Ukraine government. He begins talking about a meeting with President Trump in May in the Oval Office after he attended the inauguration of Ukraine's new president. Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical in response to our persistent efforts in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed us to quote talk with Rudy. We weren't happy with the president's directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr Giuliani. What he then starts to unspool is a set of facts and meetings that we've now heard a lot about in the last couple of months. Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refuse to work with Mr Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president's orders. How you know Mae became June became July and then August, and it became clear to him over time that President Trump, through his lawyer, Mr Giuliani, and through actions that he took wanted to extract from the Ukrainians certain politically beneficial investigations. And at one point, pretty early in his statement, he addresses the Latin phrase that has been confusing everyone. If this is going along, Was there a quid pro quo? Was it a quid pro quo of this for that? Or was it not? And, he says, with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes, unequivocally that far as I'm concerned, there was a quid pro quo around the White House meeting, right, and I was struck by how casually he says that this thing that is very much at the center of the entire inquiry and the thing that has been contested by other witnesses. He states in a very authoritatively without reservation. Now he's a little bit more cautious about whether or not there was a quid pro quo around the suspended military assistance. In July and August of 2019 we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine. I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. Still haven't to this day. So he came to conclude by August that that, too, was dependent on Ukraine announcing these investigations that the president wanted committing to the investigations of the 2016 elections and charisma as Mr Giuliani had demanded. Now someone has another clear objective is he's laying out his story, and that is to defend himself against the testimony from other witnesses who have tried to describe him as either a rogue actor or somebody that was working through an improper diplomatic channel. I'm not sure how someone could characterize something as an irregular channel when you're talking to the president, the United States secretary of State the National Security Advisor, the chief of staff of the White House, Secretary of energy. I don't know how that's irregular. If a bunch of he says no, this was the real channel. I was working with the president, United States. I was working with top American diplomats and officials, and not only was it proper, but all of those people knew what I was up to and what we were trying to accomplish as this went along. Within my State Department e mails, there is a July 19th email. This email was sent. This email was sent to Secretary Pompeo Secretary Perry Ryan McCormick, who is Secretary Perry's chief of staff at the time. Basically, you know, if if for weeks we've had witness after witness and certainly the White House and the Republicans willing to throw Gordon someone under the bus to try and push all of this on to him as a kind of lone wolf, I mean, he was taking everybody under the bus with him. Chief of Staff Mulvaney and Mr Mulvaneys senior adviser Rob Blair. A lot of senior officials these e mails show that the leadership of the State Department, the national security Council and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts, right? He's saying Everybody who now wants to distance themselves from me They were actually all in blue. That's right. It's a phrase he uses several times. It was no secret everyone's in. Everyone was in the loop, in bloom again. In the everyone was in the loop, they were in the loop. There was a September 1st meeting with President Zelinsky and Warsaw. During the actual meeting, President Zelinsky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice president Pence, and the vice president said that he would speak to President Trump about it. And what's the significance of what he's saying here? I mean, in theory, this is very explosive. The vice president, the secretary of state are being in Sahlins testimony directly drawn into this right? He's trying to make the point that this wasn't just me, like everyone understood this to be Trump's objective out of this relationship, and we were all working toward that, and nobody found it unusual that I was doing what I was doing. I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip. I wrote Mike, Thanks for schlepping to Europe. I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising, really appreciate it, Secretary Pompeo replied the next day on Wednesday, September 4th quote all good. You're doing great work. Keep banging away. And with that, someone completes his opening statement remains an honor to serve. The people of the United States is their United States ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to answering the committee's questions, Thank you. And if the Democrats turn for 45 minutes to begin asking questions, we will now proceed the first round of questions as the chairmanship has a few of his own. But mostly he passes the mic over to Dan Goldman, who is his chief investigator, who's been playing a role in these hearings, questioning witnesses directly. Mr. Goldman, Thank you, Mr Chairman, In your opening statement, Ambassador Sunlen, you detailed the benefits that you have gained from obtaining some additional documents over the past few weeks. Is that right? In terms of refreshing my recollection that right, because he doesn't shy away from what becomes clear over the course. The day is a pretty shoddy memory on the part of someone you have remembered a lot more then you did when you were deposed. Is that right? That's correct. And one of the things that, and in doing that, Goldman does something interesting, which is that the ambassador. Taylor also testified under oath that you said that President Trump wanted Zelinski in a public box. Do you recall using that expression? Yeah, goes. He repeatedly leans on those witnesses with better memories or people who took contemporaneous notes. Do you have any reason to question Ambassador Taylor's testimony based on his meticulous and careful contemporaneous notes? I'm not gonna question or not question. I'm just telling you what I believe. I I was was referring to to describe things that someone told them or that describe things that someone did and basically asked someone to confirm that these things happen. Let me fast forward a week and show you another text exchange, which may help refresh your recollection. On September 8th, you sent a text to Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker. Can you read what you wrote there to basically bring someone up in tow line with testimony they've gotten from other people about him. So you do acknowledge you spoke to President Trump, as you indicated in that text, right? If I said I did, I did. And that's important as they move towards writing report, and presenting a kind of full case about what happened to the American people helps eliminate some of the discrepancies in the testimony they've gotten. Which of these exchanges stood out to you? Well, one in particular is fresh in my mind because we just learned about it for the first time last week. And one of the things that you now remember is the discussion that you had with President Trump on July 26th in that restaurant in Kiev. Right now. Remember, that's the day after Trump himself spoke to Zelinski and told them that I want these investigations into the Bidens in 2016 other witnesses have described someone basically speaking on the phone with the president, who was speaking so loud that he had to hold the phone away for his ear. He claims to have overheard part of the conversation, and I'm not going to dispute what he did or didn't hear others could over here. President Trump asking about quote unquote the investigations. And Sandlin assured him, you know, don't worry. With some expletives laid in, President Zelinsky will do whatever you want, right? Cause Ukraine loves your tush. Uh, something like that. Well, he also testified that President Zelinsky quote loves your ass unquote. Do you recall saying that? Yeah, it sounds like something I would say, Huh? And what he basically does over the course of this back and forth, is says, putting it in Trump speak by saying he loves your ass. He'll do whatever you want, met that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues. You've heard the president. Or that's how President Trump and I communicate a lot of four letter words in this case, three letters. He also contest a couple of small points. I don't think I would have said that I would have. I would have. But in the end, he confirms the essence of the story as it's been related by other witnesses. And for the first time, I have established that that happened again, tryingto reconstruct a very busy day without the benefit. But if someone said I had a meeting on, I went to the meeting, then I'm not going to dispute that. So it's kind of familiar mix of Sandlin's self protection, lack of recall but overall damning testimony. I think that's right. So the Democrats wrap up their questioning, concludes our 45 minutes and after weeks of investigation, literally hundreds of hours of testimony and private and in public, they finally gotten from a lead witness who had direct access to the president statement admission of one of the things that they've been looking for him trying to prove out all along that this White House meeting, an official act, was conditioned upon Ukraine publicly announcing investigations and that someone, a top official, also believed that the withheld aid money that that would only flow to if the investigations were announced. And so it's with that in front of them. When we take a five or 10 minute break, thank you. That shift abruptly gavels the hearing into a pause, someone inexplicably at first, and then we quickly see why, as you walks out behind the chamber, I just want to make a couple quick observations while we're on a break here to a bank of cameras where he begins to talk about. What just took place on what we have just heard from Ambassador Song Lynn is that the knowledge of this scheme was a basic quid pro quo, which all of course, carried it live in the middle of the proceedings and when he was done. So I think a very important moment in the history of this wrapped up and walked right back into the hearing room and gaveled the thing back in. Decision. Come to order now for that wasn't lost on Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee who quickly called Schiff out. Thank the gentleman for those of you watching at home, that was not a bathroom break. That was actually a chance for the Democrats to go out and hold a press conference. Ambassador for all the supposed bombshells that was in your opening testimony. So there's quite a bit of bad blood, obviously, between the two sides. But I don't think that this helped we'll be right back. Support for this podcast and the following message come from uber.

So once we're back, given that the Democrats have already sort of embraced the messiness and unreliability of Gordon Sandlin and addressed it pretty directly, what is the Republican strategy when it's their turn to question? Well, Republicans air looking at the same guy and the same tendencies, and they see amazing opportunity to weaponize it in defense of the president. Hello again, ambassador. So it's left to Steve Castor, who's the Republicans lawyer in all of this to start trying to do that work. Just want to go through some distinctions between your your opener. In your deposition, there's a phone call that someone has where he says he was getting such mixed signals and couldn't get answers about what Trump wanted from Ukraine and why he was withholding the aid money. And I was getting tired of going around in circles. Frankly, So I made the call and he asked President Trump, just kind of point blank. What do you want from Ukraine? And that's when I got the answer. He was unequivocal. Nothing, the president tells him. I don't want a quid pro quo. I don't want anything from Ukraine. They should just do what's right. They should do. What's Lewinsky said he was gonna do? And Republicans kept going back to this call again and again and again. Not me. If there's anything sinister or nefarious in any of this, uh, Vanilla request about corruption called Sam, I'm away to Ukraine. A five minute call you didn't remember. It's significant. A call that you made where the president said, I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zielinski to do the right thing. I want him to do what he ran on and him telling you to go tell Congress the truth, anything sinister or nefarious about any of that, not the way you present okay. And that because in this case, is they pointed out. You know, when the president is speaking directly to someone, he's saying no quid pro quo. I don't want anything in particular from the Ukrainians. And you told Mr Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact, he didn't just not tell you that he explicitly said the opposite for the most senior figure and the most involved figure in all this from the Trump administration who declares that this was a quid pro quo is simultaneously testifying that the president gets on the phone with him and says, This is no quid pro quo That is complicated. It is. It's very complicated. And if you're listening at home and listening to Republican questioning their able, I think, to raise some doubts about this account that he's giving. If you pull up CNN today right now, they're. Banner says Sandlin ties Trump to withholding aid. Is that your testimony today, Mr Master Silent that you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation because I don't think you're saying that. And in this questioning, you know, someone says, I didn't hear anything directly I've said repeatedly, Congressman, I was presuming. I also said that President Trump, so no one, not just the president Giuliani didn't tell you Mulvaney didn't tell you nobody Pompeo didn't tell you. Nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct? I think I already testified. Answer the question. Yes or no? Yes. And why do you think they're so focused on that? What the president hold him versus what he has concluded from all the information and conversations around him. Republicans argument is basically that if you're going to impeach the president, you know, we need to know directly what his intentions were, what he told you. That's evidence. That's primary, What you concluded. I mean, that's that's no better than what we heard from other witnesses. It's hearsay. That's when I noticed it. So you know what hearsay evidence is? Ambassador here stays when I testify What someone else told me. You know what made up testimony is made up. Testimony is when I just presume it, you're just assuming all of these things, and then you're giving them the end evidence that they're running out of doing press conferences. And CNN's headline is saying that you're saying the President of States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations and you don't know that correct? I never said the president. United States should be impeached. So as this hearing starts to wind down after five or six hours of this back and forth after a pretty explosive and direct opening statement and then cross examination and examination and more cross examination spirits are starting to flag a little bit in the hearing room. Mr. Maloney. Mr Master, let's pick up right there. There's an exchange near the end with Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat of New York. Let me ask you something. Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president's political opponents? I don't want to characterize who would have been who would not have. I know you don't want to, sir. That's my question. Which would you answer it for me and baloney. You know, seeming to kind of burst forth with Democratic frustration that's been boiling beneath the surface all day, basically says, I guess I guess I'm having trouble. Why? You can't just say When he asked about investigations, I assumed he meant I know what you a symphony, but who would benefit from an investigation of the buttons? I assume President Trump would been there. We have it see? Didn't hurt a bit, did it? But let me ask you something, Mr Bologna. Hold on. Excuse me. I've been very forthright, and I really resent what you're trying to. Fair enough. You've been very forthright. This your third try to do so, sir. Didn't work so well the first time did it. And now we're here 1/3 time. We got a doozy of a statement from you this morning. There's a whole bunch of stuff you don't recall. So all due respect, sir, we appreciate your candor, but let's be really clear on what it took to get it out of you. And that's kind of the tone. As this hearing begins to come to an end, Democrats are frustrated about some things. Republicans are frustrated about something. Sunlen, who's trying to catch a flight back to Brussels, eyes certainly frustrated by some things. And we've had a pretty complex and conflicting day of testimony where some people seem to be coming away quite happy, but not perfectly so. So is this unreliable witness turning out to be the most important witness in this inquiry? Or is he just an unreliable witness? Well, the thing about Solomon is that Democrats will tell you. You know, prosecutors successfully bring cases all the time on highway flawed witnesses who maybe don't even have a great history with the truth. But that doesn't mean that what they're saying isn't true in a given scenario. And in this case, it's important to remember what he's saying is incredibly politically inconvenient for him. He still work for the president, United States. We donated a bunch of money to and whose policies he believes in, that that that itself lends it some power and credibility. Democrats seem to be emerging from today more comfortable and more certain that they need to bring forward this case of the president, abusing his office of committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of impeachment and putting it before the American people.

Here's what else you need to know today how the ambassador suddenly get there. You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications except one. He wrote a shack for a $1,000,000 in the fifth. Democratic presidential candidates expressed outrage over Wednesday's testimony in the impeachment inquiry, with Senator Elizabeth Warren accusing President Trump of selling off key ambassadorships to wealthy donors like boarding Sondra And that tells us about what's happening in Washington. But with Mayor Pete Footage now leading the polls in Iowa, the first state to pick a Democratic nominee, several of his rivals, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, sought to challenge his credentials and experience just like I have won statewide and mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work is a local official. And you did not when you tried. I also have actually done this work. I think experience shouldn't matter. Booted fired back, suggesting that the federal experience of his opponents was its own liability. So first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters.

e847d671-7d68-42ea-91ab-c2515a9f0a66,The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’,"<p>In explosive testimony, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, directly implicated President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top administration officials in what he said was a push for a “clear quid pro quo” with the president of Ukraine.

Blowers complain about President Trump's contact with a foreign leader. Had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine. Like I mean perfect. Today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. We are joined this afternoon by Ambassador Gordon Sunland. I'm sorry this morning. It was a long day yesterday. Hey, it's Julie Davis in the Washington Bureau of the New York Times. So today we saw the most complicated witness in these impeachment hearings to date, Gordon Sandlin. I expect that few Americans have heard my name before these events. This is the Trump donor turned diplomat. The highest honor in my public life came when President Trump asked me to serve as the United States ambassador to the European Union. So right out of the gate in his opening statements, was there a quid pro quo? Sandlin is dropping bombs with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting. The answer is yes, he says yes. There was clearly a quid pro quo. I e mailed Secretary Pompeo directly. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo knew what was going on. I mentioned Vice president Pence. Before the meetings, Vice President Mike Pence knew what was going on. The suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or robe diplomacy is absolutely false, and there's really no back channel because everyone was in the loop. Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret to Anyone was going on and he had the full buy in of the whole government on this. Everyone was informed via email on July 19 but the latest is It's complicated. So far in these hearings, we've been getting testimony from career diplomats, former military types who are very formal in their testimony. They're trained to keep notes. They have extemporaneous notes, They have memos. They have methodical accounts of what happened and documents in some cases to back it up. They've got the receipts. As you might say, Sunlen is a totally different type of character. You confirmed to President Trump that President Zelinsky quote loves your ass unquote. Do you recall saying that? Yeah, it sounds like something I would say Here he is. This guy is ah, wealthy hotel magnet from Oregon. He's a political donor. He's new to being a diplomat, and he he doesn't have any of those things. The Democrats lawyer Dan Goldman, points this out right away. You are not a note taker, right? Not a note taker. Never have been. Doesn't take notes. He doesn't have this all written down. He can't really remember some of the conversations that he's being asked about, but certainly based on the additional memory that you have gained over the past few weeks from reading the testimony of others based on their notes and reviewing your own documents, you have remembered a lot more than you did when you were deposed. Is that right? That's correct. Oh, and also he's contradicted his original closed door testimony on multiple occasions in the weeks since he first talked to the House Intelligence Committee. He started out saying there was no quid pro quo in all of this. But turns out when someone else testifies that they heard him describe one all of a sudden, he remembers, Yeah, there was one. He did describe that at one point. In short, he's got a credibility problem. It's messy. You freely admit that, you know, unless you ask your deposition, we put together a list of all the times you said. You don't recall. It's like two pages long, um, so that all so naturally, the Republican lawyer on the Intelligence Committee, Steve Castor, wants to focus on this messiness. And when he gets a chance to question Sunlen, he does just that. On a lot of these questions that mean there's nuance there, ambiguities on. We don't have records, We don't have notes, and we don't have recollections. Correct, right? I mean, it's it's situational things, that sort of trigger memory. All of these calls thes meetings with very important people tend to sort of blend together until I have someone that can show me what we discussed, what the subject was. Then, all of a sudden it comes back. We're trying to get to the fact that we're trying to find out what actually happened. What's reliable, What's accurate. You don't have records. You don't have your notes because you didn't take notes. You don't have a lot of recollections. I mean, this is the like. The trifecta of unreliability isn't isn't that true? Well, what I'm trying to do today is to use the limited information. I have to be as forthcoming as possible with you and the rest of the committee and as thes recollections have been refreshed by subsequent testimony by some texts and emails that I've now had access to, Um, I think I filled in a lot of blanks, but a lot of it's speculation. A lot of it is your guests, And we're talking about, you know, an impeachment of the president of states, so the evidence here ought to be pretty darn good. So outwardly Ambassador Song. That may seem like a terrible witness for the Democrats. He's imprecise, He's unreliable. He either doesn't remember things or he doesn't have any proof. But the question in my mind is, might he actually be the most damning witness of all? For the Democrats, He's someone who was friendly with the president. He was talking to the Ukrainians on a fairly regular basis. He had an up close view of all of this, and he's willing to make these definitive statements. Reached these big conclusions. Yes, there was a quid pro quo. No, there was no back channel. Everybody knew about this so he may not have notes, but does it actually matter? You know, the other thing that was striking about Sahlins testimony was how comfortable he seemed. He seems kind of at ease with the role he's playing in all of this. He knows who he is. He's not a career politician. He's not versed in the complicated geopolitics of all of this. He's just landed in the middle of the situation, and he says he's playing the hand he was dealt, and that may seem like someone trying to protect himself. Or it could be someone basically trying to come clean. Maybe he's not reliable, but he may be the most important witness Democrats have. Like I said, it's complicated. So that's the latest tomorrow on the daily. More on how the Democrats and Republicans handled this unusual witness. Sometimes one moment changes everything. Two years into building half post, I collapsed, Um, Alicia Burke, host of the podcast that made all the difference. I talked to achievers like Arianna Huffington about the moments that inspired them to make an impact. The medical conclusion was Arianna, you have civilizations, disease, Berna.

Uh, my name is Monica. Stop. Give a and I'm a producer for the daily, and I am here with instead. Instead, introduce yourself. Hi. I'm instead Herndon I'ma politics reporter covering the election. And I'm driving on a very long time. We're driving on a very long highway in South Carolina because we came here. Try to answer on Interesting question. What is the question? What happened? Toe Caramel Harris is presidential campaign that took her from top tier front runner status. So the middle of the pack. Okay, let's try to figure this out from New York Times. I'm Michaela borrow. This is a daily. When Senator Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign 10 months ago, she drew a crowd of 20,000 to her kick off round the biggest of any candidate, and was talked about as a potential heir to the political coalition that carried Iraq Obama to the White House Twice. Today, she's polling in the single digits. My colleagues, a steady Herndon and Monica went to South Carolina with the Harris campaign. It's Wednesday, November 20th instead, and I are in the car we're driving from the capital, Columbia, to Greenwood and Greenwood is a small town suits, you know, this is South Carolina, and why South Carolina essential to heart campaign. So she's in South Carolina because, frankly, that's where the campaign is putting their chips. They've had to, after falling on hard times, fire most of their New Hampshire team and really focused. Their resource is on the first date, Iowa and then South Carolina, where they think they can unlock black support. The thought process here is based somewhat on what Barack Obama did in 2008. That if you win white support in Iowa improves viability. It proves electability and that the black voters who like you but are scared you can't win will eventually come around. If you prove yourself in the early states and South Carolina, the electorate's more than 65% black, and she thinks that she shares a real kinship there. Well, she's been the South Carolina many times before. This is her first time in this community. Her campaign understands the things aren't going well and needs to reach out to people they haven't talked to before. Okay, we're actually working with now what's happening? We get to the building. It's a very small building and its veterans. It's like a veteran tall. There are rows of people kind of set up in 1/2 circle around what will be a panel some people have on their their veterans. Kind of Galya. We got flags behind pretty much a standard, intimate political event. Okay, let's go talk to some people way talk to voters. You try to get a sense why they decided to come. You're here today. I'm here to support coming Harris. I'm here to be enlightened about her policies. Have they decided on a particular candidate? I really am picking a candidate. You know, I haven't made up my mind. I'm still shopping, looking at all the options today, you'll be listening to what she has to say, and if she could basically win you over possible, it's possibly hit. A lot of people actually don't know a lot about her. Some people don't know anything about her. I really don't know where he was not there before. I think that's something people forget about voters. Not everyone is tuned in all the time that I really have been watching the news. You know, I don't think I washed the debate as a matter fact. I know I didn't I didn't watch. They know the field is large and they know kind of generally who's up and who's down. And in every conversation we have with these voters, this is still the South Race keeps coming up. You have to remember the context for these largely older African American brothers and good law willing and the creek don't rise. Come March of next year, I'll be 70 years old. So I've seen a lot, and basically, I still see the world has been one great big plantation. These are folks who have grown up in the shadow of Confederacy their whole lives. They have lived under the brunt of Jim Crow, some of them, and that informs how they're making pragmatic political decisions moving forward within sound. Kanada, within the African American community way, don't want to take a chance on someone that doesn't have a chance of beating Trump. So things like 2008 and Barack Obama defied their wildest dreams. It was an anomaly to them, and so they're still ah, fear of risk that a lot of them associate with a person of color, leading the ticket. I hope she's electable, but we have to change the minds of the people fear. That may be in this time where black voters are very worried about the Trump presidency, that a black candidate or a woman of color was too risky. Do you think that black men have will have problems supporting a black woman can? Yes. Why do you think so, Man have been the head. Many people we speak don't mention as an alternative don't bite. You know, I think that he's a good candidate. Joe Biden Joe. How was her body? I've looked at Joe Biden. Why? There's a lot of reasons why Joe by then looms over South Carolina. One is name recognition because he had been vice president and I don't think you know someone now. That's the only job training. He has a track record because he was there in administration before they know who he is. He's a known quantity, and he is someone who has long standing relationships in those communities. He has to debate experience, and I feel like you can go after muscle. Another reason is he has pitched himself as the candidate who is most likely to beat Trump. Something kind of explicit, like when you say that he then he could be Trump. Do you think that's because white people are more likely to vote for Joe Biden than they are in the boat for camel hair? Yes, yes. And so this is one of the big challenges Harris has to overcome even black voters who sometimes like her instinctively. I think that her identity as a black woman might be a liability for the election. And so they see Joe Biden, a white men with experience in the White House. And even this community thinks that maybe he is better suited to be Trump, and ultimately, that's what they care about the most. So again, we thank each one of you for taking time out of your business schedule coming out today, and without further ado, it gives me great. Then the event actually kicks off their several introductions. The U S senator from the Great State of California, the animal Kamala Harris and after some time, it's her time to speak, and she needs to convince the people in this room that she's uniquely positioned to represent them best. What are some of the key points she makes in this speech. Please have a seat. So I will tell you. My background is I am a daughter of parents who met when they were active in the civil rights movement in the 19 sixties in Berkeley and Oakland, California She introduces herself to the audience of her personal narrative. I grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting for justice. And then she turns very quickly to an issue. She has gotten a lot of criticism for her position on health care. So I'm running for president to put in place, Ah, Medicare for all plan, which means everyone will be covered, including people with preexisting conditions. And for her healthcare looks like what she calls a Medicare for all plan. That's still preserves a role for the private insurance industry. And this is confusing, right? It can't be. She's had different positions on health care. She started the race as a co sponsor and Bernie Sanders Medicare fraud bill, which is a single payer system that eliminates private insurance. But she kind of him didn't hauled about the specifics of that bill and then eventually offers her own plan. I'm not trying to get rid of private insurance, so I heard from too many folks who said Comma, don't take away our choice, which preserves a role for private insurance. And so this is another one of the issues people site around Kamila Harris is campaign is that when you look at key policies, if you look at health care, the number one issue for Democrats in this race she has not always stood for a singular position. She's tried to have her cake and needed to, some voters say. Even now, as she's in between the progressive and moderate approaches, she's still borrowing language from that progressive lane. We want the choice between a private plan or a public plan. Well, my plan will give you the choice that you deserve. And this is why I was a little bit confused when I hear her say that you're not the only one. But we need reasonable gun safety laws, including universal background checks. So she goes through some other issues that are important to the Democratic voters, like gun safety, the challenges facing veterans putting them out of business when they were targeting our veterans, but then and I'm just going to share with you one last thing. And then I would love to start our our conversation. She turns to the issue of her electability. What does she say? Centre Harris has added this in the last couple months, as electability has become a increasing point of conversation in this race, she's decided to address it directly. So I just want to have a brief conversation about something that's been coming up in connection with the campaign that I call the elephant in the room. But really is the donkey in the room? And it's this conversation about electability and the conversation goes something like this. Well, I don't know if America is ready for a woman of color to be president of the United States. She's addressing the identity question head on. Are Democrats too scared, or is it too much of a risk to put ah, black woman up against Donald Trump in this critical election? I know I'm ready bound off my neighbors already. Um, well, maybe it's not your turn. And she says, This is not a new conversation for me. In fact, this is a conversation I have heard in every campaign I have. And now here is the operative word, one on which is China. Evoke there is that she has broken barriers before and that voters put their trust in her. She will do it again. And so in this short time she's addressing the two big challenges of her campaign, and she's trying to solve both. She's trying to put forth a clear position on healthcare and sort of suggest that there was never any lack of clarity to begin with. And then she also tries to present her identity not as a hurdle to her success but as a rallying point that people can come together and again, just like in the past.

Then we're back on the road and we keep following Senator Harris, and the next up is Greenville. This is a bigger city. Over 62,000 people. Yeah, we're headed from Greenwood to Greenville, more urban community that can't be bothered with nothing but be out there right now and I actually find out you can sink. So we get the green hell, Theo. When we come in, it's a larger gymnasium is probably double or triple the amount of people in terms of crowd size, even though there's some empty seats. And there's also just the more elaborate setup. That's all kind of just the campaign doing amore of operational flexing of muscle for the bigger city. Right? So this is a more diverse place. It's more highly educated, it's younger, and people are following the election more closely, And so here many people already know her. I saw you on people who have picked a candidate. I know it all. What are some of the things they there was. They say what you hear from the comma Harris diehards that she first came on their radar during the Senate committee hearings, where she was praised for aggressive questioning of Bill Bar Jeff Sessions. So I think it was during the like when during sessions confirmation hearings that I thought she's gonna run for president. If she is, she's got my vote eventually. Brett Kavanaugh, especially during the Cavanaugh hearings, when she talked to Dr Ford and just looked at her in the eyes and said, I believe you. I believe you. They tell you that they like her debate interaction with Joe Biden In the first debate, she looked tough on the debate stage, and she's the one that they want to see. Go up against Donald Trump and you ask them like, But why is she not pulling better? What have you thought about the kind of trajectory of her campaign? I mean, she started up there, but she since kind of fallen. Why do you think that ISS. What are some of the the things they cite? This examples? These folks are following the race closely, and so they know that there's been a change in political standing from where Senator Hair started the race to where she arrived Now, and when you ask her supporters that why did that happen? They again point to her identity. She's been erased by the media. She's been misrepresented by the media. They blame media for preferring often white candidates over people of color. And they point to a top tier where the four candidates at the top are all white now with the Democratic Party. I mean, she's a black woman in a race that everyone's looking for a white savior candidate. And so, um, but I think, don't count her out. She's got a strong ground game and the event kicks off with a couple of introductions, including from a high school student. Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you someone who looks just like me. Yeah, they've had started having Organizer's introducer, particularly women of color, to lean into that representation aspect. Well, good afternoon, Greenville. It is wonderful to be back and throw the speech. The thing that gets the most ovation is when she goes after Trump, we will need as our nominee someone who can stand on that debate stage and go toe to toe with Donald Trump and Grieve. Ilya, looking at us, you're looking at her. There's a couple lines that any Democrat can say, and they'll get the audience on their feet. A surefire crowd pleaser is to attack the press today, and somebody needs to remind Donald Trump that some of his closest relatives are immigrants, too. And especially with the impeachment proceedings going on, Senator Harris's lines of justice being on the ballot are prosecuting the case against Donald Trump are always going to get the crowd on their feet. The question is, if it's just about Trump, why is that a reason to prefer Kamala Harris over the rest of the Democratic field who are also making those same arguments? And that's why I'm running. I thank you all so very much. Okay, where we going? We are in Greer, South Carolina, the following day, bright and early, we join her again. It's next to Greenville, and this time it's raining at a community center. Okay, need more recreation communities in there. We're here where she is speaking to maybe 2025 people, all African American, older residents, and have lived long wonderful lives. You'll remember that she spent a lot of her speech or lowering prescription drug costs and her health care plan. But she also mentions more systemic problems. And remember those zero nothing brokers like Housing and Equality and Equitable education issues that matter to older black voters. You don't have to go and get a loan from one of those private companies that are charging these outrageous interest rates. I'll take some of the equity out of my home to help you pay for tuition. So thank you very much. After the speech, we see something that I haven't experienced so far. A pastor starts a prayer for her. She's literally holding her hands and the whole room. Everyone is standing up. Dave, when you that ought to do about this, I already knew that you would dress after that. They need war. It wasn't next. This is one of the cool things you can see while campaigning specifically in South Carolina. Because the Democratic electorate is so black and because the black electorate, particularly southern states, air so religious. A lot of the campaigning happens through thes religious communities. Pastors and black communities are not just religious leaders, their community leaders, their political leaders there, cultural hubs and particularly with black candidates. There's like a sense of kinship. There she will you. I pray that you are every car that she journeys. May I ask you to be tried every fund that she would think I asked you to be. History Caramel Harris is a religious woman, and there is a shared language of faith that happens at these events that you see with other candidates. It's not like they wouldn't pray for a white cat. But there's something different when it's someone who they know has worshipped in their churches for their whole lives. And so she prays for her. And she mentions that the last presidential candidates he prayed for, that I laid my hands on him. Afraid for in the presidential election was Barack Obama Morocco. The Reverend is Reverend Gatson, but you goes by pastor teeth so we could declare. They call me Pastor T the Reverend Kelly Lynette gets and we actually catch up with her after the prayer. You know, that was your first time seeing the senator I imagined my first time seeing, but not first time hearing about and then we ask her about the race. Have you? Are you someone who personally has, like, I made a decision about who you want? Oh, I have not. I have not. And that's been because the field is so wide, you know. But where I am, as I've shared, is just a posture of, first of all, praying for our country. What? You can see how that represents a problem for cardinal hairs way have this pastor who says she last laid hands on Barack Obama but isn't ready to give her support to Kamala Harris, someone who started this race so strongly by trying to capture the same kind of coalition that Obama did. We've heard that the challenges to her campaign are her identity and the lack of clarity on policy. But those same things could have been set for Obama. So what's different in 2019 the Barack Obama coalition that he rose to power with combined young people, liberals and historic turnout for black people? And there's not one candidate in this race that has yet been ableto win those different demographic groups. And that was supposed to be common hairs. I mean, it was supposed to be a number of people. It could have been better or could have been. Cory Booker could have been Kirsten Gillibrand. But when we entered this race, the thought the reason why her candidacy was so feared was because she was thought to be the one who could most quickly tap in to that coalition. Well, there are differences that we knew would be true from the start. And there's things that we've learned over the last 68 months from the start, we knew that as a black woman running, she would have no historical Touchstone and she would face unique barriers. And I think if you asked the campaign, they would say, That's true, But it's really about messaging. We knew that this race would be defined by a progressive wing led by figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and a moderate wing led by Joe Biden, and that people like Hamlet Harris would have to exist threading both worlds. And that's been difficult. When you talk to voters, the most consistently repeated thing is, well, I don't necessarily know what she stands for, and I think that is born out of those two wings. The progressive and moderate wings defining this primary through their fight. And so Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can say, If you aren't with single payer health care, you're not a progressive. If you're not willing to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, then you will have big ideas. And the moderate Wing has defined themselves by rejecting that bye defined themselves by saying, Well, we can't do that or we won't be Trump. But if you're trying to do both of those things, if you're trying to thread in between those worlds, we have seen electorates that aren't really willing to give people that benefit of the doubt. And that's driving a lot of the anxiety right now, particularly among the party's moderates. And that's why we see all these new candidates jump in the race. The anxiety breeds uh, um, restlessness, right? And Deval Patrick, who just announced Mike Bloomberg, who's expected to, are trying to capitalize on that anxiety because in the circles that like the in the circles of elite Democratic moderates, they are a group that expected to have more options. Not that surprised at the way Joe Biden's candidacy has turned out were the biggest surprises is they thought they would have an alternative figure to Joe Biden, who could replicate that Obama lane. Now remember, these are a group of people who think that Warren and Sanders progressive policies will lose them the general election. They think that Warren and Sanders, if they are the nominee, will struggle to bring out the type of people that put Democrats over the top. And without that, without someone in the top tier who is winning black voters and exciting young voters at the same time, there is fear that you cannot replicate what Obama did. Now their argument is that that's because of the campaigns that this individual candidates and individual campaigns haven't done the things necessary. Thio produce that support, but it could be because of a changing electorate and two wings of the party that just aren't looking for emerging savior anymore. We'll be right back.

And what was your concern? It was inappropriate was improper for the president to requested to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there's best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation, one of them, Lieutenant Carnell Alexander of Inman, said He immediately interpreted Trump's request for the investigations as a demand, given the imbalance of power between the United States and Ukraine and the desire by Ukraine's newly elected president, Vladimir Zelinsky, to secure a visit to the White House.

Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, gave public testimony of his alarm at what he heard during President Trump’s July phone call with the leader of Ukraine. Appearing in his Army dress uniform trimmed with military ribbons, Colonel Vindman spoke of himself as a patriot, an account that Democrats echoed. The president’s Republican allies, however, told a different story.</p><p><em>“The Latest” is a new series on the impeachment inquiry, from the team behind “The Daily.” You can find more information about it&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/podcasts/the-latest-impeachment-alexander-vindman.html"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>","Wed, 20 Nov 2019 01:09:25 -0000",https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/rss.art19.com/episodes/3f1d1c56-2ebd-4ca9-9bb7-d38bc6cf1e19.mp3,"it started with a whistle. Blowers complain about President Trump's contact with a foreign leader. Had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine. Like I mean perfect. Today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. Good morning, everyone. This is the third in a series of public hearings the committee will be holding his part of the House impeachment inquiry. Um, it's my Schmidt in the Washington Bureau of The New York Times. Today was another big day of testimony. Testimony coming from four different witnesses split into a morning and afternoon session. Three of these witnesses were actually on the infamous July 25th call between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelinsky. And not surprisingly, much of the testimony today was about that call. What did these officials think about the call when they heard it? How is it dealt with? What were the implications of it? Why was it troubling? But the latest is that for me? What we really saw today waas the Republican strategy on display in a way that we hadn't before. The best example of this came with how the Republicans treated one of the witnesses in the morning session. The uniform I wear today is that of the United States Army Lieutenant Curl Alexander Veneman VE Inman is the director for European affairs at the National Security Council. He's a career military officer, and in his opening statement he describes how his father chose to come to the United States from the Soviet Union. When my father was 47 years old, he left behind his entire life so his three sons could have a better and safer lives and the profound sense of duty that instilled in him. As a young man, I decided I want to spend my life serving this nation that gave my family refuge from authoritarian oppression. And he finishes his opening statement by looking straight at the camera in addressing his father directly. Dad, I'm sitting here today in the U. S. Capitol. Talking to our elected professionals is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union come here to the United States of America. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth. Thank you again for your consideration. I'll be happy to answer your questions. So obviously this is a powerful introduction, and immediately this sets him up as a strong character witness for the Democrats, a uniform patriot essentially just trying to do the right thing for his country. Colonel Inman. What was your real time reaction to hearing that infamous July 25th call? So when Adam Schiff, the committee chairman, takes the mic, he draws on Vin Mons background and ask him what his reaction was to the July 25th call, which Vin Man had been listening in on. It was inappropriate. It was improper for the president to requested to demand an investigation into a political opponent, which ve Inman characterizes as a demand by the president to investigate one of his political rivals. Colonel you. You've described this as a demand this favor that the president asked Chairman, the culture. I come from the military culture when a senior asked you to do something, even if it's polite and pleasant, it's not to be taken as a request. It's be it's to be taken as an order. And then it was. The Republicans turned to question ve Inman, and this is where we saw this new sharp line of attack from them. I think the ranking member. Colonel, I want to thank you for your service and sacrifice to our great country this afternoon. Your former boss, Mr Morrison's gonna be sitting right where you're sitting and representative Jim Jordan, who's sort of been the tip of the spear for the Republicans at these hearings, brings up earlier closed door testimony that Vin Mons boss Tim Morrison had given. Mr. Morrison said this I had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vince Mons. Judgment. Jordan says that Morrison as well as Fiona Hill, another National Security Council official, had concerns about Vin Mons judgment. So your boss had concerns about your judgment. Your former boss, Dr Hill, had concerns about your judgment. Your colleagues had concerns about your judgment. Any idea why they have those impressions? Colonel Denman? Yes. Represented Jordan. I guess I'll start by reading. Um, Dr Hill's own words as she she attested to in my last evaluation that was Vin Man kind of deftly responds by taking out his own performance review and reading from what Fiona Hill said about him. Alex is a top 1% military officer and the best army officer I've worked with in my 15 years of government service. He's brilliant, unflappable, and exercises excellent judgment. So, uh, Mr Jordan, I would say that I can't say why, Mr Morrison, question my judgement. Maybe it was a different cultures. So we're seeing here that the Republicans air turning their focus from what the hearing was intended to be about. The phone call between Trump and Zelinsky to basically a fight over who've Inman is his credibility, and this has been a talking point of the conservative media for weeks. Here we have a U. S national security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House, apparently against the president's interest. The Republicans in the House are using the exact same rhetoric, but now, straight to Vin Man's face and in the middle of his testimony, the White House began to run with it, too. The White House, where bin men still works. They tweeted out during his questioning the quote from Morrison. I had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vin Mons judgment, so there's no real surprise here. The hearings are playing out along party lines, but the question is, how will independent Americans see this? Who will they believe? Will they believe this man sitting in his military uniform with the Purple Heart on it, talking about a patriotic sense of duty that his father, who immigrated to the United States, instilled in him? Or will the American public believe conservatives in the House and the White House and the far right media? That's sort of the question of these hearings, so that's the latest. Sometimes a single moment can change everything. I used to stay up late at night with my dad watching movies on TV, and one night he cried. Um, Alicia Burke, host of the new podcast that made all the difference. I talked to achievers like documentary filmmaker Ken Burns about the moments that inspired them to make an impact. I knew that there was some power to film that I wanted to be a part of you confined that made all the difference. Anywhere you get your podcasts created by Bank of America, what would you like?

I'm Michael Bavaro. This is the daily Today. As they lobbied the Trump administration for a $1.5 trillion tax cut, corporations promised that they would invest the savings right back into the U. S. Economy. Jim Tankers investigates whether that actually happened. It's Tuesday, November 19. All Americans. I say it's time for change in time for leadership. Just think about what we can accomplish In the 1st 100 days of the Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. Donald Trump had promised he was going to cut taxes. We are proposing major tax relief for the middle class and lowering the business tax from 35% all the way down to 15% big tax cuts for individuals and especially for businesses, which he said was going to revitalize the American economy as a big part of his economic program. And you will see companies expand companies come back into our country. Companies not leave our country anymore because taxes and regulations or so owners, it's one of his top priorities. He gets into office, his team starts working on it but it's not what they do first in Congress. Finally, we want a very big tax cut, but cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obama care. But they try to do first is repeal Obamacare this morning. Republicans are fighting to pass a new health care plan. Right now, House Republicans just don't have enough votes to pass the replacement to Obamacare. And in the spring of 2017 that effort is not going well. And neither is Trump's tax plan went on well. The version of the tax bill that Republicans are working on has some big opponents in the business community. And there's a real question over whether they can actually craft a bill that passes muster with enough folks in Congress and with the business community and makes it all the way to President Trump's desk and he'll sign it. Remember this feeling like a perilous moment for this young presidency? It's struggling to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and it is struggling to convince people to support its tax cuts. Right. There's a lot of discord within the Republican Party as to what works when it comes to tax reform. And when it comes to health care six months into his term, he has exactly zero big legislative accomplishments to boast about it. If there's one thing you would have expected a Republican president with Republican majorities to be able to do, it's past a big tax cut on. Yeah, we're at this moment in the spring when that looks like that might not happen and into the breach of that steps. Fred Smith and who is Fred Smith? Fred Smith is a former Marine who went to Yale and wrote a famous paper in a class that imagines a new type of company that is so wild in its imagination that he gets a C on the paper. But he turns around and takes the basis of what he has sketched out on the paper into a company and builds it into FedEx America. You've got a new airline. There's no first class, no meals, no movies, enormous multinational shipping conglomerate and delivery company Federal Express. And how exactly does the founder of FedEx, Fred Smith, get involved in this? Well, he has been an advocate for lower corporate tax rates for a really long time. And now he sees this opportunity with President Trump, a real ally of corporate tax cuts in the White House, to push this plan he's been working on for years. And he does something more than just pushed the idea of tax cuts into the public discourse. He and his team, it Fed action, actually write their own plan. Wow, their own tax proposal. And what's in this Fred Smith plan? The FedEx plan is really centered around a big cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% and some extra carrots for businesses to be ableto right new investments off their taxes right away. So two things that Fred Smith and a lot of other executives say are going to spur a renaissance of business investment in America. The fundamental problem with U. S. Tax code is that it punishes invest. The argument is that the United States was being held back in its economy by a lack of business investment, and at the end of the day, investment is produced high paying job. The company's just weren't spending money that they were sitting on basically in they weren't spending it on capital spending that economists. He is very important to economic growth. You make the United States a better place to invest. There is no question in my mind that we would see a renaissance of capital investment, a growth in GDP and an increase in income for our blue collar work force. What kind of investments is Fred Smith talking about when we talk about capital investments? What do we mean we're talking about? Plants were talking about equipment in FedEx is case we're talking about airplanes for transportation hub or new technologies that can help to deliver or sort packages faster. So something that can help you make your business run more efficiently. That's the kind of thing that economists think of as big, productive capital investments God, And the reason that would help the rest of the economy is someone has to build that plant. Someone has to build that plane. It just ripples across. It ripples across for a couple of reasons. One creates demand for those products that are being invested in which yes need to be built and need to be installed or or flown or whatever. But the other real argument is, is that having these new technologies put in place helps workers do more. Investment is the only way to make blue collar workers people that don't have college degrees more productive and and have more income. So you can hire six people to move a pile of dirty. You can hire one person with the bulldozer, the differences, the bulldozer. The bulldozer driver makes a lot more money than the people with shovels, and the argument was that companies weren't doing that because their profits were taxed too heavily. And it was more profitable for them to invest in other countries then in the United States, because America's tax rates weren't competitive. It's just like us playing basketball and on our end of the court, were playing with a 12 foot basket and everybody else that we compete with around the world of shooting on a 10 foot basket. Fred Smith makes this very clear promise, saying, If we cut corporate tax rates, businesses are going to start investing again in America, and the economy is going to grow faster, and that's gonna help workers and everyone. Jim, how skeptical are people of the Fred Smith School of thinking here that big corporate tax cuts will lead to big investments in the economy and to a lot of growth in the U. S. Well, a huge part of Washington is not skeptical it all. They are pushing this. The Trump administration Republicans in Congress, many sort of economists who support tax reform are arguing to one degree or another that there will be Maur investment lots more if you just cut the corporate tax rate. There is, though, this dissenting group, including a lot of Democrats and liberal economists who make the argument that, hey, companies have a lot of money. They don't need lower taxes to have just a little bit more money to invest it. If they want to invest it, they can. It's sitting right there on their balance sheets, and cutting their taxes is not going to dramatically increase investment, because that's not what's holding them back. And I'm curious. Jim. How much was FedEx paying in corporate taxes at the time that Fred Smith was making this argument? So throughout the time that he's making this argument, FedEx is paying what it calls in its financial filings and effective tax rate of about 33 or 34% which is a lot in the just the fiscal year 2017 alone. It paid more than $1.5 billion in taxes. So that's a meaningful tax bill. It's a meaningful tax bill. And it's close to the top corporate tax rate in America, which is 35% before the trump tax cuts past. So what happens to the Fred Smith the tax plan? The tax plan arrives in Washington and gets a warm reception, and it injects energy in what had been a little bit of a stalled process, brightening prospects of a major tax cut, especially for corporations. And it helps open the door again. For all of the champions of tax reform, toe work together for a new bill and as a Christmas gift to all of our hard working families. We hope Congress will pass massive tax cuts for the American people so Republicans get back on track on the tax bill, particularly spurred on by the fact that they fail completely to repeal the Affordable care act. So now this is it. The business community is back on board, their lobbying hard. The Trump administration is working key details out with congressional negotiators. President Trump is heading to Capitol Hill today to boost momentum for the tax reform bill that could become his first legislative victory. We enter the fall, the House passes. A version of the bill debate is still happening on the Senate floor, but this bill does appear to be gaining momentum. The Senate narrowly passes a version of the bill with no Democrats supporting it. And then they put them together. And the final proposal includes the really big corporate rate cut, basically, just like what Fred Smith and FedEx had proposed. And it includes a bunch of other incentives for investment. Also like FedEx it proposed. And then, of course, the bill passes Bill passes. I do vaguely recall in my fever dreams from that time period of working 20 hour days that the bill did pass and the president did sign it into law. The corporate tax rate is, you know, will be lowered from 35 to 21%. That means that more products will be made in the U. S. A. A lot of things are going to be happening in the USA. We're gonna bring back our companies that they've already started coming back. I think they had certain confidence in me. They figured we're gonna get this done. This law includes individual tax cuts. It includes some other provisions, but the centerpiece. The thing it was sold on was the idea that we would reinvigorate economic growth in America, and it would do that by supercharging business investment. It's almost hard to understate just how often and vocally Republicans and the president made that case to voters that this is what American business and the American economy needed from, or domestic investment. So once this bill passes, what is? FedEx is tax bill? How much does it save? So the bill passes and FedEx files financial statements for the fiscal year 2018 at the end of the year. And it shows that rather than paying one point five billion like it paid the last year, it actually was owed money by the government. It has a negative, effective tax rate. What? Yeah, negative. 5%. So less than zero less than zero Wow. And how much of that savings? 1.5 plus 1,000,000,000 is attributable to this tax bill, all of it over the 1st 2 years after the tax law, we can count 1.6 $1,000,000,000. That's a pretty staggering figure. But then again, we know that FedEx plans to use that money to reinvest in the American economy. So that's the story that FedEx told before the law passed. But the story that played out is different. Leary Back when the scientists of Dana Farber Cancer Institute discover the PTL one pathway so vital to making the immune system attack cancer, it transformed immunotherapy into a revolutionary way of treating cancer everywhere for 72 years, from pioneering chemotherapy to harnessing the immune system, Dana Farber's cancer breakthroughs have changed the world. Learn more at Dana Farber dot or GE forward slash everywhere surgeon. What happened with all this money that FedEx saved from this tax cut? That it played such a huge role in shaping? FedEx had said, you know, up to the eve of the bill being signed that they were gonna use the money to increase investment, but they didn't. Investment actually went down compared to what they had projected, and then the next year it went down again. So what did FedEx do with these savings? If they were not investing it in the kind of things that we all thought they would. Well, it largely rewarded its shareholders. It increased dividends, which is the money it regularly pays, people who own it stock. And it bought back shares of that stock, which has the effect of pushing up prices of the stock for the people who own it. Now, to be clear, it did some good things for its workers to it accelerated some raisins. It increased the size of its workforce. It made a large contribution to its pension plan. But the big winner were shareholders. And that's a group that is largely if you look at who owns stock in America skewed toward the very wealthy. So the promise the FedEx made that they would invest much of the savings from this tax cut into the kind of projects that would benefit everyday workers across the economy. Instead, the benefit of the way they use this money really went toe people who are largely already pretty well off. In the short term, that seems very clear. Why do you think that the text did I had a lot of questions for FedEx about how they spent their tax money. I tried to ask them of executives over a period of a couple months, I was never granted an interview with an executive. I sent very detailed questions, including one very similar to the one you just asked. Most of them went unanswered. I would love to hear FedEx explanation of how it has made the decisions it's made with its tax cut windfall. Jim. How typical was this for companies that received these big savings from the tax cuts that they did not use to invest? And instead they used it to buy back shares or pay dividends? It was very typical. My colleagues and I did a few different analyses to sort of demonstrate just how widespread this type of behavior was. And here's a few ways of looking at it. One is that companies increased share buybacks and dividends by about triple as much as they increased investment following the tax cuts. Wow! Another is that investment has now grown more slowly since the tax cuts under President Trump. Then it grew before the tax cuts under President Trump, which is another way of saying that the central claim of the tax cuts and how they would be used and how it would benefit the economy that has just not come to pass. It is not Jim. If these companies were to call you back and you were able to ask what they're thinking was, would there be an argument from a company like FedEx about why the way it chose to use this money is wise and will benefit the American economy? Absolutely. The argument goes like this First off, rewarding shareholders is just another way to increase investment because those shareholders will use that money to invest in different companies who will use that money productively. The other argument is that it's just too soon to tell the effects of tax cuts on investment that basically what changes for cos when you cut their tax rate is not, oh, they get a bunch of money today. It's that investments tomorrow pay off even more because the profits you get back, you pay less taxes on. And so we would expect overtime to Seymour Investment not right away. Is there any truth to that? Are these arguments from the company's about how they use this money accurate that eventually will really help the economy I think there are mechanical truths that you can see to those arguments. But it's also true that this is all really complicated and that this was sold as a very simple relationship. Cut the taxes, investment will increase. And just the fact that we're not seeing that happen right away flies in the face of the arguments that were used to sell the bill. I think that's really important here. Is that yes, it may be true that investment over time is slightly more competitive in America because of a reduction in marginal business tax rates. But that was not what President Trump stood up at rallies and talked about. He talked about, you know, growing the American economy by 3456% a year because of all this flood of investment. Come back to the United States and we just don't see it. Jim, why is this important? At the end of the day, I mean, these companies successfully lobbied for a tax cut. They got it. It's their money. Theoretically, can't they just do what they want to do with it? Whatever that is, I think it's important to hold politicians and their supporters accountable for the promises they make, particularly when those promises have Rhea World implications. The economy is not performing as well as we were promised it would when the tax cuts were passed. It's not growing as fast. It doesn't have as much investment. And if you believe the arguments that were made to sell this, that's hurting workers because slower growth is keeping their incomes from rising as fast as they should be. So real people are suffering from not having that additional growth that they were promised they would have. And now don't. And then there's this. One last thing which is visible comes at a cost. It's not free to just give money back to corporations by cutting their tax bills, despite what the proponents said, which was that the law would pay for itself the additional growth. What we're actually seeing is a massive hundreds of billions of dollars a year effect to grow the federal budget deficit, and last year that deficit came very close to topping $1 trillion. And how big or rule is the tax cut flame in that ballooning deficit? It is the primary driver of additional deficits beyond what we had already before the law was passed. Jim, thank you very much, thank you. In a statement, FedEx criticized The Times reporting about its tax savings and investments, but offered no specific factual objections. In the statement, the company's founder and CEO, Fred Smith, challenge the publisher of The Times to a public debate about federal tax policy in Washington. In response, a spokeswoman for The Times dismissed the request as a stunt and a quote effort to distract from the findings of our story, We'll be right back.

Underneath the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not her say inconsistent with international law. On Monday, the Trump administration declared that the U. S. Does not consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be in violation of international law, reversing four decades of American policy. We're not addressing or prejudging the ultimate status of the West Bank. This is for the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate. The Times reports that the new policy would likely doom any peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians by legitimizing Israeli settlements on West Bank territory that Palestinians have demanded for a future state.

Plus, impeachment investigators are looking into whether Mr. Trump lied to Robert S. Mueller III.</p><p><em>“The Latest” is a new series on the impeachment inquiry, from the team behind “The Daily.” You can find more information about it&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/podcasts/the-latest-impeachment-mueller.html"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>","Tue, 19 Nov 2019 00:38:17 -0000",https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/rss.art19.com/episodes/4a048895-13a7-4bcf-b4e1-7290ff955984.mp3,"it started with a whistle. Blowers complain about President Trump's contact with a foreign leader. Had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine. Like I mean perfect. Today I'm announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry drama expected on Capitol Hill this week with the most crucial testimony yet. At least eight witnesses are scheduled to testify this week in public hearing. Hey, it's Julie Davis. It's Week two of the impeachment inquiry, and we're preparing for tomorrow's hearings when we're going to hear from four witnesses all on the same day and Knick fan does. Our congressional reporter is going to be there. He's on Capitol Hill right now, preparing to take in all this new testimony and try to digest it and figure out where we are. So I'm gonna give him a call and see what he's thinking about what we can expect. Daily Press. Hi. Can I talk to Nick? Fan does, Please. One moment. Let me see where he is. There's usually good hold music with one moment. Uh, this is Nick. Hey, Nick, it's Julie. Hey, Joy. So let's talk about how tomorrow's gonna go. Why do we have four witnesses. Last week, on the first day, there were two Bill Taylor and George Kent, and Taylor really was the standout witness. He was the one who attracted all the attention George Concert about Lost in the Shuffle. And then on the second day, Marie Evanovich was by herself. You know, it was just her on the panel, and that seemed to really open up a lot of room for Democrats to draw out her story in a compelling way. And so I'm just kind of wondering why I called for people on the same day. So I think that there's a couple reasons, the main one being that Democrats just feel like they're in a time crunch houses out for Thanksgiving next week, and I think they want to move through out of these people quickly. The other thing is that tomorrow there's technically two hearings, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and the afternoon is just two witnesses that the Republicans have requested. And they're pretty ticked off, frankly, that those witnesses got shoved in the afternoon. That's when typically, attendance is pretty poor for congressional hearings. People aren't gonna be tuning in so much. So they're accusing Democrats of tryingto bury those witnesses that happened to them last week with their questioning, right. Like they didn't get to do the questioning till the afternoon when the viewership was way down. Yeah, totally. And I think they go into the evening. This time will be the worst. So who are these four people testifying tomorrow? Has has that gonna work? It's Lieutenant Colonel Alexander of Inman, was the top Ukraine expert at the White House and was very alarmed by phone call that he overheard between President Trump and the Ukrainian president. Another witness works for Mike Pence, the vice president. She also wasn't in on the call. She didn't think it was great testified that you thought was improper, but did not raise her concerns in the same wave Inman did. And then in the afternoon, you've got Vin Mons Boss Morrison on the National Security Council at the White House, and Kurt Volker, who was the special envoy to Ukraine and was one of the so called three amigos who were like deputized by President Trump to run Ukraine policy last week. We really heard about kind of the context in which this call happened. You know, career diplomats who talked about how they felt pushed aside by Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sandlin, and to some degree, Volker himself in a way that allowed this call toe happen. What's interesting to me about tomorrow is it seems like we're sort of circling back to the July 25th Call the thing that started this whole saga, the thing that touched off the whistle blower complaint. You have people who listened in in real time to President Trump and the president of Ukraine. Three out of the floor, I think. Right, we're on that call. Yeah, that's right. So I think we're gonna hear really different impressions of that phone call ve Inman was really alarmed by it and when and raised is concerned immediately with White House lawyers and that it would fits the frame of a cover up that the White House immediately tried to move to lock down this transcript because they knew was problematic. Morrison, on the other hand, is going to talk about how he didn't see anything improper with the call and did suggest that it ought to be locked down, but only because he thought it might be in this polarized environment might be politically unflattering to the president. So we're gonna hear a lot about what the White House was thinking during this consequential call that will both kind of push against the president's characterization that it was perfect and then also maybe lend a little bit of authority behind that claim. So who is the single witness your most eager to hear from? And what do we want to hear from them? Kurt Volker. He was the first witness who did a private interview with lawmakers more than a month ago now and basically at the time told them Ah, lot of details that themselves were not flattering for the president that have helped them assemble their story. But his own conclusion was that there had not been a quid pro quo. And so, you know, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since he testified. A lot of other witnesses have come forward that have made him look either like willfully ignorant, dense like he may have been misleading the committee. Who knows? So I'm really curious. Does his testimony evolve it all? And if so, that could be a big blow to the president and his defense because they really leaned on him. Or does he stick to his guns and say, I was deeply involved in all of this? I worked closely with Gordon's on land. I spoke with Rudy Giuliani, spoke with the president, and I don't think that there was, in the end, any quid pro quo. And in that case, I think the Republicans would be pretty policed with him. Great. Well, thanks, toxin. Thanks, Joy. Okay, So I should also mention that the other big story today that relates to all of this is that we learned that lawmakers in the impeachment inquiry are actually investigating whether President Trump lied in the written answers he gave during the Mueller investigation. So House impeachment investigators are looking at this question officially now. And the reason that that's interesting is because there's been a lot of questions. And there's been a lot of debate internally among House Democrats about whether they even want to go there and deal at all with the Mueller investigation when they get to drafting articles of impeachment about this Ukraine affair. There had been a thought early on that they should stay focused just on Ukraine just on this clear allegation that they're looking at right now about whether the president abused his power. But now this brings back this question of whether the president's conduct and in this case, whether the president's actual truthfulness in the Mueller investigation is going to be an issue for impeachment articles in the House. And that's an open question, and we still don't know the answer yet, so we're following that, too. So that's the latest. Sometimes one moment changes everything.

I'm Michaela borrow. This is today. It was the most valuable startup in the United States, with plans to revolutionize how and where people around the world worked. Amy chose on the spectacular rise and fall of we work and the story of the man behind it all. It's Monday, November 18th. Amy. I wonder if you could read this letter that we work employees sent to their bosses. Sure, here's what they wrote to the weak company management team. We works. Company values encourage us to be entrepreneurial, inspired, authentic, tenacious, grateful and together. Today we're embracing these qualities wholeheartedly as we band together to ensure the well being of our peers. Thousands of us will be laid off in the coming weeks. But we want our time here to have meant to something We don't want to be defined by the scandals, the corruption and the greed exhibited by the company's leadership way want to leave behind a legacy that represents the true character and intentions of we work employees. In the immediate term, we want those being laid off to be provided fair and reasonable separation terms commensurate with their contributions, including severance pay, continuation of company paid health insurance and compensation for lost equity. Pretty grim letter it ISS So how did we work? Get to this point What's the story here? Co founder and CEO of We Work Adam Newman. Theo. The story of we work really starts with a man named Adam Newman thing growing up in Israel watching American television and movies, I believed that the American dream is get a degree, get a great job, have lots of fun, make lots of money. He was born in Israel. He moved to New York. I majored in entrepreneurship and marketing, and he started all of these sort of fly by night entrepreneurial ideas. One of them was genius. Idea was gonna be a women's high heel shoe with the collapsible Hill women's high heels with collapsible heels. Another one. George. No, because it's uncomfortable. Michael tow walk around and heels all day. So you collapsed thumb when you're going down subway stairs. This is definitely not my past, and I came up with my second great idea. Trawlers with the cave crawlers was baby pence with knee pads on them to protect the baby's needs for the crawling age Kneepads for crawling babies. The slogan was, Just because they don't tell you doesn't mean they don't hurt off course. The business was a tremendous failure, so he settles on co working, and in 2010 started we work. We work as a leader in the business of renting out space is to entrepreneurs, the company. It was a very specific time to be in the co working business. There were a lot of people, had a lot of startup ideas. Silicon Valley was booming, and you needed a place to work outside your parentsbasement. It lets people rent out a desk or a private office equipped with amenities like Internet coffee and spacious common areas. They were sleek. They had community space sofas all over the place. For team building, there was cold brew calm. Boucha, taco. Tuesdays. There was beer and wine on tap. Instead of going out for a drink, you'd stay at the office. It really came to symbolize the kind of start up entrepreneurial hustle of millennials. Other words. This kind space was perfectly timed for a generation of people who didn't see themselves as office workers, but as individual businesses and entrepreneurs who needed a place to do that. Exactly way work is the office space of tomorrow. The future is about light innovation. Creativity is going from me way give you space that will inspire you, uplift you and help you innovate products off tomorrow. So in Adam's mind, this was a community company. His mission was to elevate the world's consciousness. He would talk about this, so he grew up partly on a kibbutz in Israel, and he would talk about it as a capitalist kibbutz. It was this mix of like capitalistic hustle with this yearning for communal meaning, Adam Newman would say that he wanted. We worked to create a world where people don't just make a living, they make a life and they make a life in these we work. Office is exactly the thing Adam Newman is really best at is communicating his vision, convincing people that he can change the way we work and live. He fully adopted the persona of the iconoclasts startup founder, and he looks apart. You know, it's six foot five with flowing brown hair. You know, people looked up to him when he walked in a meeting with people. They literally paid attention to him. But the most important person who bought into his vision is a Japanese executive, the head of a company called Softbank. The thing is, you know, I have a vision held Masayoshi, son. Everyone calls him Masa. We go and change the world together. Massages, company, overseas something called the Vision Fund. Thinking about what is the future? What is the how we can change the life of people for the better humanity thing. This is the largest tech investment fund in the world. They have $100 billion to play with, largely from the Saudis who want to diversify away from oil and invest in tech. And Masa is this very interesting character who's always trusted his gut. One of the investments you made is considered by many people to be the most successful investment in the history of mankind. You invested roughly $20 million in Alibaba at the time it went public. It was worth roughly $90 billion. What is it that made you feel this was worth putting in $20 million? Well, he had no business plan, but his eyes was very strong. Strong eyes thrown, shining eyes. Uh, And so he meets Adam Newman. Adam Newman gives Masa a tour of his offices. This includes the right soundtrack in the background and all the sleek office space and virtual reality renderings of we work office space in the future. So you could wear these glasses and feel like you're standing in Tokyo or Shanghai, right down to looking out the street and seeing the scene that you would see from the offices. And this really blows Mosses mind. He loves this vision. He loves Adam's energy. You know both. We work and thought bank a vision fund or shoot the moon operations. So So after a 12 minute tour of the We work offices and Adam Newman's vision, basically both willing to make humongous bets and they're sort of enabling one another Masa son invest over $4 billion in we work. And by the way, I work in a we work. So we were I hear they have good drinks on tap. David, this is an enormous investment, and he doesn't say, Adam, I need you to be very careful steward of this extremely important investment. Be careful with my money. Instead, he says, I need you to go crazier. I need you to do more. I need you to explore your wildest visions, he said. That he says, go as far as you can with this, and there's more money where this came from. So just how wild does Adam Newman go with this $4 billion investment we're at? We work in Austin, Texas, right now. He started opening. We works all over the country office at Crystal City. We were just opened up today. Every major American city had a wee work new office space, which is in the We work in Long Beach, California and then he expanded massively abroad. I feel like I remember this moment because I woke up one day and had a long walk around Manhattan and there was a we work at every single Laurel Taylor building. Absolutely, they became ubiquitous. We work now is 45 million square feet of real estate. It's the largest private landlord in New York, Washington and London. And then giant companies started also moving their employees into we work offices, thinking it's a draw for employees to work in these spaces, like which companies horizon, sales force, IBM all moved a lot of employees until we work. Office space is this is the point when Adam really leans into Mosses advice, which is to go wild, pursue your craziest dreams. He opens at we live apartment building and wants to expand that, he says These are places that will have community and cut down on the suicide rate because people never feel alone. He was talking about. We grow and he and his wife opened a school in downtown Manhattan. There was we bank, there was we sail. There was. We sleep. There was talk of an airline. We fly, we fly. Presumably there was talk of we Mars even putting office space on the Red Planet. That really is wild. It was wild. So Adam Newman becomes fantastically rich. He also indulges his eccentricities, and he was known to walk around the office barefoot. But now he's installed a private plunge pool in his office, a cold plunge on infrared sauna in his office. He has a white May back. He's like blaring hip hop as this chauffeured white Maybach takes him all over Manhattan. He also convinced the company to buy a $60 million private plane, Um, which he and other executives. Hot box. I'm sorry. That's, you know, getting high in a confined space with marijuana smoke filling the cabin tequila. Adam Newman loved his Don Julio tequila. He would even get people who didn't seem the tequila type like Jared Kushner to take tequila shots at nine in the morning. Well, they were scoping out some real estate in Philly, but employees said that there was just free flowing booze all the time. A lot of marijuana, a lot of these summer camp kind of weekend retreats. People would get drunk and they dance around a fire, singing to journey and other sort of Animal house antics, but always infused with this like larger purpose. Adam would get on stage with, like Deepak Chopra and address employees. And it was this culture of we work that was very specific to kind of Adam's vision for the company. So Amy is Adam Newman becomes this larger than life character. As we work as opening offices all over the United States all over the world, and is this term we start to get applied to all areas of life, our people starting to question whether this is getting just a little too big and whether it's all kind of adding up. By and large, people looked at what Adam had accomplished. We work on every corner as you said, taking over iconic buildings, and they believed in what he was selling. And then on top of that, you throw in Masa, this Japanese tycoon who had made a fortune investing early on in these founders Alibaba, Yahoo uber just based on gut instincts. And if he believed in Adam, why shouldn't everyone else So we work? Does what successful startups do They prepare to go public, meaning they can sell their shares to the public? There's evaluation on the company of $47 billion. That makes it the most valuable startup in the country and part of going public. They have to disclose everything in paperwork, and that's when things start to unravel. We'll be right back at the daily. The headline is just the beginning, just like how it 80 p payroll is just the beginning, because they also provide industry leading HR talent, time benefits and more informed by data and designed for people so you and your company can achieve what you're working for to get the full story on how a teepee is designing a better way to work. Visit design 0.80 p dot com A teepee always designing for people way work, just unveiling its profiling. So why did things start to unravel when we work files office paperwork to go public? So this is the first time that journalists, investors, the public can really look under the hood at what's going on and we work. Do we have any numbers in terms of how much money that make you losing right now? And it's not pretty. Net losses were just under a $1,000,000,000.904 million. The company had lost $900 million in the first half of 2019 alone. They had rapidly expanded into markets that weren't necessarily friendly. Toe we work, and there had also been some kind of questionable financial dealings between Adam and the company that he started. Like what? While he had trademarked the word we and sold it back to the company for $5.9 million he ended up returning that money. But that certainly raised eyebrows. He had bought a lot of the buildings that we work was now leasing. So the company had paid him millions of dollars for space in the office is that he owned. So this is all very unconventional and potentially even self dealing, right? But then there's the text of the AIPO, the legal document that they filed with the SEC. The word community is listed more than 100 and 50 times, and there was all of this kind of propping up what we now know is a very unprofitable business with this lingo of self help and creating community. And people just started to see it as selling air, you know, couching this unprofitable business in language that made people feel good. Eso this paperwork filed with the SEC really sets off an implosion unlike any other and start up history. All the bad press and bad moves caused the company's expected valuation to drop from 47 billion down to just 15 billion. So come in as low as $10 billion. Of course, Italian, the office sharing company, below $8 billion that is a fraction of the value of we work plummets. So this is when discussion starts to spread of well, should there even be a Ni Po. Is this company ready to go public? And people start to turn on Adam pretty quickly. At this point, we work. CEO Adam Newman is facing new pressure from some of his top investors following the company's decision to postpone the I PS. Some board members and large investors in the company are privately discussing whether they could replace CEO Adam Newman and how they would do it. They think he should be removed. He should not be the CEO of we work. Not only should they not be the CEO, but he should have no involvement and we work anymore. Yeah, this is now official. We work has officially come out saying that Adam Newman has stepping down as CEO. Eventually, Adam is forced to step down. People are supposed to say, I hate to be and I told you so, but I love to be and I told you so. This house of cards was coming down this business based on being bags, distressed furniture and espresso machines, and yet somehow this guy has been treated to some guru genius because he's such an effective self promoter. PT Barnum is supposed to have said. There's a sucker born every minute. That's what's going on here and Wall Street. They were suckered, too, along with with Softbank buying in where they get this, $47 billion for $12 million in cash. So they decide that even getting rid of Adam does not save this effort to go public. And they have to pull the I Po. I mean, this is hugely embarrassing. This company that had been valued at $47 billion most valuable startup in the country is suddenly valued at a tiny fraction of that. And this Japanese investor, Masa San, who had been such a visionary. It's extremely embarrassing for him. Ultimately, he has to apologize to investors specifically for putting so much faith in Adam Newman. So what becomes of Adam Newman? At this point? He has been pushed out of his company. In a way, he has been exposed as someone who was a better salesman than operator of a company, and it becomes pretty clear that he has built something that is not all that revolutionary but is a little bit of a financial house of cards. Well, here's what's so interesting about what happened to Adam Newman. He walked away from the company he founded with over a $1,000,000,000. How is that possible? Softbank bought his shares and we work, and they also agreed to pay him $46 million in consulting fees for four years. Wow, Nice work, if you can get it. Why? Softbank would say that this was the cost to get Adam out and start to clean up the mess, which includes laying off potentially thousands of employees. You know, in this letter, the employees call it graft. Here he was walking away with over a $1,000,000,000 in generational wealth as they face layoffs, losing their health care, getting nothing. They right? We're not the Adam Newman's of this world. We are a diverse workforce with rents to pay, households to support and Children to raise. We are not asking for this level of graft. We're asking to be treated with humanity and dignity so we can continue living life while searching to make a living elsewhere. Amy, how do we explain what's happened here? The pre sad Psagot of we work in this situation that is ended with all these workers waiting to be laid off So the story of we work and Adam Newman is essentially a story of his exploitation of two phenomenon. The first is this kind of late stage tech capitalism, when investors really want to believe in these startup founders who have businesses that are essentially sort of traditional businesses with tech layered on uber is a perfect example of that calling a taxi with her phone and, in turn, give these companies enormous valuations when the business underpinnings are not necessarily there. So the irony, of course, was that Adam Newman tapped into this tech vernacular about changing the world about revolutionizing office space. But his company had really nothing to do with tech. It was a commercial real estate company, but people believe that. But it had a tech valuation because investors believed it. The second thing he quite brilliantly exploited was this yearning of millennials having this capitalist ambition and hustle, but also this yearning for community this we generation, as he called it, that it's not about you or me. It's about we, and in the end it essentially was about him. It is us will blaze a path forward, pave not with algorithms, not with software but with values, with friendship, with common goals and, most importantly, with humanity. And I think that's been particularly hard for we work employees to stomach. It's not just that the business turned out to be not as profitable as they thought it was, and their CEO walked away with the giant golden parachute. It was that they believed that it was bigger than that. They believed it was a community, and now they're saying that it wasn't and the wee revolution is going to be led by the regeneration, and it will restoring each one of us a sense of dignity and community without which greatness cannot wait. Generation way. Thank you, Amy. Thank you, Michael. On Sunday night, The Times reported that we work is preparing to lay off at least 4000 employees. Those layoffs are expected to be announced as early as this week. We'll be right back. The daily is supported by T. Rowe Price. Saving for retirement is a lot like running a marathon.
