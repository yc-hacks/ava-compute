The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," How about the guy with the telephone? How about that one? I guarantee that never took place, He said He's sitting there listening to me, and he gave kind of a preview of what the Republican and Peter response will be and what his reaction is going to be as this whole thing unfold"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," Ah, lot of it had to do  They say, What? Ukraine? Which is that everything the president did he did because of corruption in Ukraine  He did, because he essentially was the victim of this scheme that Ukraine was trying to pull off  But Mr Person interesting  It's very interesting"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," They have the server right from the DNC Democratic National Committee  Who has the circle? The FBI went in and they told him, Get out of here  You're not kidding  We're not giving it to you"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," They gave the server to Crowdstrike, or whatever it's called, which is a country which is a company owned by very wealthy Ukrainian  And I still want to see that server  You know, the FBI has never gotten that server  That's a big part of this whole thing"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company, where you sure they did that? In short, he's saying that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind interference in the 2016 election"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," So why wouldn't he re evaluate or question or ask Ukraine to investigate? And why wouldn't he be skeptical of having a White House meeting or sending hundreds of millions of dollars in American military assistance money to Ukraine? Are you sure they gave it to Ukraine? Well, that's what the word is"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," That's what I asked actually in my phone call  And you know, I mean, I asked it very point black, because we're looking for corruption"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," So this is interesting because, of course, just yesterday in the final day of the impeachment hearings of the week, as Democrats are kind of wrapping up their public case and getting ready to sort of sum it up in a big report for the public, their witness, Fiona Hill, who was the top Europe and Russia expert at the National Security Council, almost seemed to anticipate this"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security service's did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps somehow for some reason, you craned it  This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security service's themselves"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," She told Republicans in the room  This idea that Ukraine influenced the election, this idea that it was Ukraine that meddled and not Russia  It's fiction  The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," I say this not as an alarmist but as a realist and the cost of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advanced Russian interests  Thes fictions are harmful, even if they're deployed for purely domestic political purposes"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," Not only is it fiction, but it's fiction that is essentially a Russian disinformation campaign that is designed to interfere with American democracy  Right now, Russia's security service is on  Their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," We're running out of time to stop them and you know, The Times reported this afternoon that Fiona Hill's testimony ah, lines with information that the American intelligence community has actually been sharing with senators in recent weeks and telling them over the last couple of weeks that they've discovered that Russia for years has tried to frame you Crane as the nation behind the 2016 hacking to say that it wasn't us, it was Ukraine that framed us"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," But based on what we saw on TV this morning, it seems like this is going to be central to the president's impeachment defense  He's not dismissing  This is a conspiracy theory"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," He's embracing this as kind of the core of his own defense in the impeachment case, and furthermore, frankly, I want to try  You know, I could think I could have it  You want to try what Everyone? Oh, I would"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," But we're starting to see signs that this is also the story we're gonna be hearing in the Senate once the House more likely than not votes to impeach Trump in the coming weeks, sending things to a trial in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," Lindsey Graham, who is the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, wrote to the State Department this week asking for documents about Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of this Ukrainian energy company, their contact with the former Ukrainian president, the context that other members of the Obama administration had with Ukrainians in the past"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’, It's all a sign that he's going to try to lay out in hearings some sort of alternate narrative to what the Democrats have been presenting in the House
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’, And it looks like that's the same narrative the president was promoting today and that Fiona Hill and American intelligence officials have been warning about
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," I'm not a doctor, But if I was writing a prescription, calling in every week to update the country about what's happening might be good for your health, that's something to consider  You have the phone number, you know that  I've been doing it for years"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," Remember group with your group? I've been doing it for stress release  It was up to me, and it is up to me and we'll do it more often"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," But I have a lot of fun doing it, and you know what? The nice part we get? We get the true word out, and that's the latest  We'll be back when things pick up after Congress is holiday break  Sometimes a single moment can change everything"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," I used to stay up late at night with my dad watching movies on TV, and one night he cried  Um, Alicia Burke, host of the new podcast that made all the difference"
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’, I talked to achievers like documentary filmmaker Ken Burns about the moments that inspired them to make an impact
The Latest: A Call to ‘Fox & Friends’," I knew that there was some power to film that I wanted to be a part of you confined that made all the difference Anywhere you get your podcasts created by Bank of America, what would you like the power to d'oh!"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg,"I remember in history class must have been a junior  He was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all all the scandal, everything that was going on  And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And he said, You know, when anybody here ever want to be president or wantto run for office Seeing what a mess and one ugly place Washington wasn't it? I just may be involuntarily"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," My hand went up, and from then on it became the running joke, the class that I'd wind up running for president  Then, by the time I got to college, I had this institute of politics at Harvard, and every day they would be a different speakers would come through"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Remember when I was there is a freshman people like Donna Brazile, who would just come off managing the Gore campaign, and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain and the former president of Ecuador  He'd been deposed in a coup"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," You just kind of hang around and watch him and see what they were like  The biggest realization was that they're just people, these people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but there they were just people"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I think it changed my awareness of the fact that on some level I could be part of that world, too  But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice  You could be in elected office"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Or you could be an out gay person  Not both  Please, not where I was from"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, From the New York Times Unlikable Borrow This is the daily I am running my candidacy for president in our series on the pivotal moments in the lives of the top four Democratic candidates for president
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I'm running for president and I'm running for president, president of the United States today  I'm a proud son of South Bend, Indiana, and I am running for president  It's Friday, November 22nd  So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for the times, and you've been closely tracking Mayor Buddha"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Judge in In order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we're trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives  So when it comes to Pete Buddha judge, what moment should be focused on"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography, is very central to his appeal to voters, and he's got a great story to tell  He's been elected mayor of this medium sized town in Indiana before turning 30  He has an Ivy League pedigree"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," He's been a Rhodes scholar  He's worked at a prestigious consulting firm  He's going off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy reserves  So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you're a voter, wow, he really stands out  There's something unique about this guy"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret the secret that he couldn't confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically, since he went away to college and decided, Hey, you know I can run for president and he doesn't see how it's possible for the politician with the perfect background"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," The perfect resume toe also be open about their sexuality in his case  So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment  Welcome to the studio  Thank you  You're gonna sit there"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana, where Peter Buddha judge is born  Mayor  Tell me about the kind of kid that you were going up in Indiana"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Well, I think I was safe to say well on the nerdy side lived in ah, neighborhood kind of middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you'd call a prototypical Midwestern kids upbringing"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," You know, playing in the park with friends  A lot of time in the house  It was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them that I was in in baseball, I think loved science and science fiction loved reading"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Plus, I was an only child  So I think it's safe to say I had ah lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was dog and my parents who were both academics and me"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," What was your introduction to even the idea of politics? Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate, they're really cared about what was happening  I remember the Democratic convention  It must have been 1988"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," NBC News Continues Its coverage of America's convention's been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was  I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech, but I look out at this convention  I see the face of America red, yellow, brown, black and white"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," We all precious in God's sight  The Rial Rainbow Coalition  And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican convention to I mean, you would stop  You know, I don't think I ever crossed their mind to ever vote for Republican  Get out"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Now let's go down to the podium  Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention  Everything in the house would kind of stop, and it was time to watch what was playing out  Thank you"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And what moment and this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating  Two feeling really drawn to it  Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats at the time"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," It's crazy to think about now, polarized as we are, but would have felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center right and center left, both of them very committed to growth and and business"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, But but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country  And I think there's a moment for any kind of well spoken or intelligent young person watching the news
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," When you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, Well, that's not right  I could do that  I could do it different now you might be wrong"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," You think they might be way more sophisticated than you are and you can't see it or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they're saying is just not right"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom are extremely impressive but, uh, none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence  They were just so at this point, you're too into Harvard"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, Have you made up your mind? You're probably going to find a way tohave a career in politics  I knew I wanted a career that involved policy  I don't think I'd figured out for sure that that meant running
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Plus, you know, when I thought about it even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home  I had an unpronounceable name and I was, ah, Democrat who lived in Indiana"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running, but I think it's safe to say, By the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Well, I wanna talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact that the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay and so I want to ask you about that part of your identity"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you? I think it depends what you mean by a realization  Right there  Things you could point to going way back  Certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," That, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush, but I was not willing to think of it that although some part of me must have  I mean, I wasn't stupid either"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there By the time I was I was hitting middle school  But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Well, what did you do with those feelings? I guess I packed him up  Yeah  Packed amount  Much would be the best dancer  Back him up and put him where? I don't know  I don't know how these things work even in your own mind"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I just didn't explore them, that's for sure  First of all, they're not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such  Growing up, I mean in high school is exactly zero  There was just no sense of gay life for a gay community"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And when I got to college, that's when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up  Why? I think because you just can't escape it"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I mean, thank God you're in college, right, Nina? Any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," For a lot of people, it's a big part of what you spend college on, right? So how did you deal with it? Same way I dealt with it up to them, just packed it away, Stated women remarkable women  Because I enjoyed these relationships"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn't the same as, uh, what it was to be in love with somebody  And your political ambition was already solid at that point"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Yeah, I still didn't know exactly where would take me or what it would mean, But I think by then I knew that there was a good chance I was gonna be running for office in my adult life"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But at that point, I'm still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing that maybe I'm straight or I'm bisexual  I just not worry about the gay part"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I think what I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future, how is gonna be involved? I wasn't even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But I'm sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was very least different and as became increasingly clear gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was a simple fact that that didn't fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life not just ah career, but a family"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I wanted to get married  I don't have kids  From my perspective  You could be married and have kids, or you could be get both  You graduate in 2004 That wrong? That's the year when Massachusetts legalizes gay marriage"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Yes, The court today is, you know, in a 43 advisory opinion to the Senate has ruled that in the November 18th 2003 decision they meant manage, they meant equality  They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny, manage right to same sex couples"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," So I say that on Lee to try to understand, Are you falling behind the culture? In a sense, are you ignoring some of the signs that these things were changing? Midge and only Midge will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Well, thing is, I wasn't from Massachusetts  I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there  And, ah, nothing against Massachusetts  But I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn't belong there, either"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Um, why not? It was just It was just a different culture  I didn't realize that  I didn't realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest and just little things  Cultural things, the way I don't know the way people interact What's expected of you"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Once I got there, I realized that socially I was way more Midwestern than I thought"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy reserves, so it starts with 9 11 actually starts before 9 11 There's this family tradition of serving in the military"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," There's a painting hanging on the wall of my parent's house of a relative, a great uncle who kind of idolized in theory"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Hey was an Army Air Corps pilot, and so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea of being in the military, and then it never really became riel"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But I remember on 9 11 thinking, Oh, war isn't just a thing that happens in other places where in other periods of history, like war has come to my generation to and thinking, at least in the back of my head that that might mean I would be involved but not taking any steps to do with it"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when, when some friends of mine start to serve a friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve was fascinated, and then when I I was talking thio someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And she's a faculty member whose giving advice to students and just said pointedly like You might wantto really think about how you're going to say that knowing that you're gonna be competing against people from the military academies  Oh, yeah, that's true"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Like my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller, held up against what others air doing"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service? Knowing that that to get a roads to be in that world in that league, you know, it might be a good thing, I think definitely that it was part of how your fruit to, ah, culture of service and also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over the certainly the Kennedy School"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," As you might imagine, that can't be separated from his military career"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would've served up until roughly the time when I came of age, when everything shifted an expectation that you would serve Uh, well when you're looking at the history of you know, the people we were studying"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Ah, President made history  Yeah, as presidents  And then the thing that put me over the top of this experience, knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college  We went out, We took a week off and rented a car"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama  They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa  And it felt like anytime I met a young, especially a young man"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, It was somebody who was serving or was about to surf and starting to realize here you had service  That used to be something that bridge people together now is completely different
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," That if you were rural or low income, you were highly likely to serve if you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically  But I'd had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Almost nobody with that background was serving, and I began to feel like it wasn't just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn't got round to is that I was part of a problem  I was part of a divide"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready, tow, Yank, open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, Hey, how do I sign up? I wonder, Do you think you join the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career? You know, I wrestle with that because this is I get that question"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," There's a part of me that thinks if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn't pure in some way? And I remember the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Popular What? I still do it, and I want to believe the answer is yes  But there's no way to go back and prove it  I'm not somebody who thinks that it's like a prerequisite that if you want to run for office, you need to have served"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, But I do think you have a heart for elected office  One way to put your money where your mouth is is to have been in that kind of service to you
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," That strikes me as a very candid answer because, of course, you could just say, Well, of course I would have done it even if there was no possible political benefit"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And I want to say that I just can't prove it, Huh? So I want to talk about this Run from air for just a little bit  Whenever you want for office, your character is on display, and at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, Secret? Did it feel like you're hiding something? Not really  The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating  Then I would crack a joke or something
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," We'd be sitting in a studio like this one, and a radio host would ask a question  And I'd say, Well, if anybody listening is in the economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, um, except for the fact that it wasn't actively looking for love, us going out of my way to avoid it"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But if somebody had a straight up asked me on the record to this day, I'm not sure what I would have done"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Do you think that that would have potentially cost you? The mayoralty would have kept you from being mayor Staying mayor? Yeah, I think there's a good chance of that  There's a reason why"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," No, as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana  This is a state with strong Christian values and not known for progressive, social, uh, outlooks on politics"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And here I am, rocking up 29 years old, saying, Trust me, Support me  Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community  Never mind this county councilman who's the party favorite  Go with me instead"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or ah, vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all  So I want to now move into this notion of you reconcile in these things  Yes"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, So when I first joined the reserve that the message was kind of your pretty much gonna goto one of these wars and we'll let you know which one  And so I knew that a certain point
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," It was coming and of course I didn't want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this  So we had gained it out with my team  If I get orders, here's what you do"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don't think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality  If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, I'm the hardest thing for people who deploy is the fact that you're leaving behind somebody you love in addition to all the professional complications
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But then the more I I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that that I didn't have Ah ah, I wasn't coming back to ah family"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," My parents, of course, but I wasn't coming back to a household  And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love  And the idea that I'm here I am  I'm a grown ass man"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I own a home of the mayor of my city  I'm a military officer and If I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it's like to be in love and that just maybe realize how untenable this situation I was in real Iwas"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And up until then, it didn't seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy and I might have differed coming out and having a dating life forever  If not for this moment where I'm thinking should I could die  You were the letter I want to ask you about"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Yeah  Ah, you know, it's the thing you do  I assume everybody does it  I don't know  Um, but it's the thing you do when you go to war  You want to make sure that you have the last word on ah on your life and leave a few instructions"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope put just in case on the outside  Put it in the desk drawer would have been pretty easy to find if if worse came to worst on"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Ah, and that's a real moment, too, because you're sitting there staring at the screen, trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life and What did you say? Well, what I said was that I wouldn't want people to think that I'd been cheated"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, That obviously be terrible if I didn't come back
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But I'll say this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to d'oh, let alone at my age and that I'd had this very fulfilling life and of course, would be, ah, be too bad if something happen to me"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But but to keep that in perspective  But if you're asking if there was like P s, I'm gay  No, that's kind of so you're unemployed"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," You do not die, but you come back and your mayor And how do you decide that it's time to come out? Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it's just was more how and when remember resenting the idea that you're supposed toe have to come out right straight"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," People don't have to come out  What do I And then, while I'm in the process of figuring this out Thank you all for coming  It's been a tough week here in the Hoosier State, but we're gonna move forward"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the governor, Mike Pence in his so called religious Freedom bill  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination  So suddenly we're on national television, my state as the most officially anti gay state in the country"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Look, everybody supports religious freedom  Certainly everybody in South Bend, including me  What this bill has done is send exactly the wrong message about what kind of state we are  And I don't want people thinking when they first think of South Bender, they think of Indiana about discrimination"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I want them thinking about everything that's good here  I'm fighting him on it, of course, because it's a terrible policy"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But now I'm fighting this terrible anti gay policy, putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I'm more effective because people don't know that I'm gay and at the same time knowing that that this just kind of speeds things up even more"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," That, like, is just a really weird position to be in to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people when it really means me  Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that that soon the Supreme Court's gonna weigh in on marriage"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," When all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I'm wrestling with how to do this  And so, oddly enough, it was another military experience  I had my two weeks a year that you do when you're in the reserve"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I went off to training, and if you're as busy as a ZAY was his mayor, military duty actually felt like kind of a almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I wasn't used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and and write and think and call friends and get advice  So you produce a plan? Yeah, well, I produced a letter and op ed, I guess"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," What was the essential line? You know, I'm sure you remember that you wrote, um I remember saying that it's just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job the way I do  My did my job"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Either as an officer is a mayor or in business had nothing do with the fact that I was getting on dhe that it still sounds a little defensive  Yeah, um or maybe a little scared  Probably  Yeah"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I mean, ah, you know, I didn't feel like I was coming out guns blazing  And I felt like I again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all  Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I'm not just in my own life that my main agenda was personally, I want to get out there and start dating, but also, that would mean something"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people When I came out and said This old back to kill a Mockingbird is unmissable and unforgettable Raves Rolling Stone five stars The New York Times declared it a critics pick saying This is a mockingbird for our moments of beautiful elegy, IQ satisfying, even exhilarating new play about justice in America"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," New York Magazine calls it majestic and incandescent  This mockingbird is filled with breath and nuance and soul This is the most successful American play in Broadway history, says 60 Minutes  Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, a new play by Aaron Sorkin  Tickets at tele charge dot com"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Ah, very personal announcement coming from South and Mayor Pete Buddha judge Today  In an essay published in today's South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buddha judge penned an essay in Tuesday's South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay  A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Now it comes just months after the state's religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights  As for the mayor himself, he says, nothing is different, Nothing has changed and his focus is on South Bend"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I want to talk about the timing of the exact moment of the up, because my sense is that at this phase of your career, your up for re election right, you've won the primary and winning the primary in a sense, means you're you're standing a very good shot of winning, depending on the year"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But yeah, in South Bend, it should be  So does that mean you deliberately chose a like, a safe, low risk? Time to do this? I don't know  I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there's no such thing as a safe time  I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," So once you come on, how does your personal life change? Well, I started dating, and it kind of changes everything  I'm gonna sell it this very demanding job  You're the mayor"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And so anybody in town that you ask toe like have a cup of coffee is it's a thing  Yeah, it's a thing  It might be misinterpreted  You could cross some line without meaning to"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I mean, most of the people I interacted were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me  So it's not like a very healthy pool what I'm saying"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And I remember thinking there were all these all these kind of city fathers who early on my time is mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And I was just thinking like, Where are you now? Like did none of you have like a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do  I went online  It turns out there's APS for all of this"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," There was OK, Cupid Tender, the one that actually came through for me was called a hinge  And it's supposed to serve up people that I don't know how the algorithm works"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile and, ah, like I want to know this guy  So start chatting  Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously he's the one I remember because that was Justin  You feed your husband? Yes"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," So your story too many people is a particularly compelling when everything we've just discussed you are a Harvard graduate Rhodes scholar  You're a veteran, you're gay, you're religious"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing to some degree to run for president for a very long time  Even though you're quite young  And I'm sure you understand that I have heard this"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, That has led to this perception of a person kind of perhaps orchestrating a political biography
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Do you ever question whether that no matter what your intention is could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine? Yeah, I think we're condition to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, And I don't view myself that way  Although I get that that that story has been written around me  Although I also don't know what it is we expect  Like that somebody can get struck by lightning and then and then they turn into somebody who might become president
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," We all have these paths, right that they bring us to where we are  And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about this story that you tell about yourself at the end of the day"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, I'm not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office  Were to be the president  I'm not coming in  The presidency is a thing that I'd liketo occupy  I'm coming out is this way to do something that I think I'm able to d'oh
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And I think it's helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else  And oddly, I think that that helps prepare me to do what's required toe to do this  And this is advice  I give talking to students, too"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," You imagine somebody's being sworn in an ambitious, talented person, kind of the middle of their career, is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East and then imagine if if that person has got there one of two ways in kind of universe"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, A
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," It's a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and ah and did everything in order to occupy that title"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And the other person is somebody who said my woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States of force toward peace in the Middle East"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," They don't know what that's gonna mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist, or maybe they're in academic  Or maybe they're, ah, civil servant or whatever, but by whatever winding path they wind up in this job"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," All right, which of those two scenarios is gonna lead to somebody who's better equipped to take that job? They've been handed, and I got to think it's the latter  And so what I've tried to do in my life is Thio prepare myself to be useful to others"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Ah, and yes, I think that in all likelihood means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office, or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time  But it's not about necessarily having one title or another"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And so I think if you over think it, that's where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you've been chasing for a long time"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Jimmy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete? Booted about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would in danger, that ambition"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," I think we learned a lot about his decision making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And he's been very intentional along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long term political career  Now some people would think on the one hand, that's too calculating  I don't want somebody who's thought about being president since he was a teenager"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And you know, in the era when voters seem to prise authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic  On the other hand, the decision that he made toe wait seems to have borne out to his benefit here"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," He is the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States, who has a legitimate shot at being his party's nominee  Look at where he is in the Democratic primary  Right now  He's rocketed to the top of the polls"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," He's brought in all this money, in large part because he's gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors  He's heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, But we won't know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one's cast a single vote, and we don't know how voters in the Democratic primary going to react way certainly don't know how voters in a general election are going to react"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, So we're just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," When you think back to your younger self not just your teenage self but even your college self in your post college itself, who is so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish? You could tell that person that version of mayor, but it is well, back then, I would have thought this other fact if I dared to unpack it"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," This fact about my life this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero in terms of the impact I was gonna have in the world that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn't get to make a difference in public life"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of things I'm seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point when actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," It's a strange thing to think about that  The one thing that I couldn't control, the one thing that might have meant, that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purposes"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Entire campaign  Thank you very much  Back West Side story is an explosion of every imaginable idea of what a musical can be, says New York magazine  The radioactive fallout must still be descending on Broadway this morning, says New York Herald Tribune"

The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Hill testified that when Trump in solid press Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that you cream interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia's hands  Since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference"
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg, This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security service's themselves
The Candidates: Pete Buttigieg," Thes fictions are harmful even if they're deployed for purely domestic political purposes and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was indicted on charges of bribery and fraud after a long running corruption investigation, throwing his political future into doubt at a moment when neither he nor his chief rival have been able to form a governing coalition"

The Latest: The Irregular Channel, I have no interest in announcing outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction except about the truth
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," It's Mike Schmidt in the Washington bureau of the New York Times, as we've talked about before, the whole point of these hearings for the Democrats is to create an ah ha moment for the American public, a moment that would help build support for impeachment"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel, But the latest is that what we saw today is that there are also ah ha moments happening for the players in this story
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," Um, is the microphone on? I believe it is now is perfect that as the witnesses were watching each other testifying, they themselves are coming to understand what was going on around them during this saga, major things that they did not fully understand in the moment"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," Thank you again, Mr Chairman, Mr  Chairman, ranking member newness and members of the committee  Thank you for inviting me to testify before you today, I have a short opening statement  So today's witness was Fiona Hill, one of the top national security officials dealing with Ukraine"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel, I take great pride in the fact that I'm a non parties on foreign policy expert  It was served under three Republican and Democratic presidents
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," She was part of team normal government foreign policy, meaning she was very upset when characters like Re Giuliani and specifically Gordon Sandlin, the trump donor turned you ambassador that we heard from yesterday, showed up and basically started doing her job  Very unfortunate"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," Hide a bit of a blow up with Ambassador Sunland, and I had a couple of testy encounters with him  One of those was in June 18 when I actually said to him, Who put you in charge of Ukraine? And I'll admit I was a bit rude on"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," That's when he told me the president would shut me up  She's saying that at the time she experienced Gordon Sandlin is this kind of rogue agent  Is someone operating outside the normal channels of government? I had to say, but often when women show anger, it's not fully appreciated"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," It's often, you know, pushed onto emotional issues, perhaps, or deflected onto other people on What I was angry about was that he wasn't coordinating with us  So I was upset with him that he wasn't fully telling us about all of the meetings that he was having"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," And he said to me, But I'm briefing the president  I'm breeding chief of stuff Mulvaney  I'm briefing Secretary Palm Pill and I've talked to Ambassador Bolton  Who else do I have to deal with? And he's telling her at the time, I'm telling everyone who needs to know"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," The point is we have a robust into agency process that deals with Ukraine  It includes Mr Holmes that includes Ambassador Taylor's  The Sharjah in Ukraine is includes a whole load of other people, but she's not getting it"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," She thinks that he's hiding things from her, that he's not telling other diplomats that he's just off on his own, having his own policy  It's on Lee when someone starts to testify yesterday that she realizes"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," But it struck me one yesterday when you put up on the screen ambassador's son Lindsey, males on who was on these e mails, and he said these the people who need to know that he was absolutely right  Her anger, it's online, was misplaced and kind of missed"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel, The point from Sahlins perspective  He's the normal channel  There's nothing irregular about it  He's just doing what the president told him because he was being involved in a domestic political errand and we were being involved in national security
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," Foreign policy on those two things had just diverged, so he waas correct, and I had not put my finger on the out that at the moment  But I was irritated with him, and I did say to him, I'm busted a Sunland garden"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," I think this is all going to blow up and here we are, So it's pretty remarkable"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," In her testimony today, Fiona Hill is saying that as she watched Gordon someone testify yesterday she realized that Fiona Hill and the other career diplomats they were the ones who were on the outside looking in"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," They had become the irregular channels, and it was at that moment that I started to realize how those things that diverged and I realized in fact that I wasn't really being fair to him, busted a Sunland because he was carrying out what he thought he had been instructed to carry out, and we were doing something that we thought was just a CZ, perhaps even more important, but it wasn't in the same channel"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel, So what sort of this incredible image you have all these characters in this drama  Some of them have worked closely alongside one another  Some of them briefly intersected some of never even actually met before  But they're now forever linked because they're witnesses in this impeachment inquiry
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," And what we saw, at least today, is that by bringing them all together in this forum, they're learning about their own shared story at the same time than Americans air learning about it themselves  It speaks to the complexity of this whole thing"
The Latest: The Irregular Channel," If we're finding it hard to understand, we should be humbled by the fact that so are the people who were there  So that's the latest  Sometimes a single moment can change everything"

‘We Followed the President’s Orders’,"from New York Times  Unlikable borrow  This is daily  Gordon is a trump donor turned you ambassador turned witness in the impeachment inquiry, whose testimony has been contradicted on multiple occasions today how both Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee chooses to handle their most complicated witness today"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," It's Thursday, November 21st  Give us a sense of what it felt like to be in that room this morning, as the committee prepared to hear from  Gordon saw on this very complicated with us"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," So we knew that in the middle of this jam packed week of impeachment testimony, Gordon someone's appearance was going to be something different  Nick Van Does was in the capital for someone's testimony"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Sunlen has really been described by almost everybody as having been in the middle of this pressure campaign on Ukraine this summer  Now there was particular anticipation because someone's story, unlike some other witnesses, has evolved as time has gone on"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," So when he first came in and spoke in private with investigators in October, he was pretty unclear about whether or not the president was trying to leverage White House meeting or security aide for Ukraine to get the investigations that he wanted  He told them repeatedly"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I can't remember this  I can't remember that  Well, after that happened, someone submitted a supplement to his testimony in writing up  Do that instead  Actually, I do think there was a quid pro quo"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, And so there was a lot of anticipation heading into his testimony as to which Gordon someone would show up
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, What story was he going to tell us? You're gonna copped all these different things? How is he gonna treat the president has you gonna treat his own evolving story? And it really felt like it could go either way
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," So what happens? How does this much anticipated hearing again? Show a little after nine o'clock Gordon, someone walks into the same grand hearing room where all the impeachment hearings have been taking place  Chairman Shift dropped his counter"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And then, after taking an oath to tell the truth and nothing but the truth so help you God, someone sits down and begins reading from a pretty thick stack of papers and opening statement that he's brought with him"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And he starts by saying that I have not had access to all of my phone records  State department e mails and many, many other State Department documents"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," His job is made more difficult by the fact that he has not been allowed to go back to the State Department look, ATT notes or records that might be able to fill in his recollections"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Having access would have been very helpful to me and trying to reconstruct, with whom I spoke unmet and when and what was set seems to be a nod at the fact that his story is in the most generous sense evolving"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And he begins to tell the story about his involvement with Ukraine policy  Over the last say, five or six months, the U  S delegation developed a very positive view of the Ukraine government"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, He begins talking about a meeting with President Trump in May in the Oval Office after he attended the inauguration of Ukraine's new president
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical in response to our persistent efforts in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed us to quote talk with Rudy  We weren't happy with the president's directive to talk with Rudy  We did not want to involve Mr Giuliani"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," What he then starts to unspool is a set of facts and meetings that we've now heard a lot about in the last couple of months  Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," We all understood that if we refuse to work with Mr Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine  So we followed the president's orders"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," How you know Mae became June became July and then August, and it became clear to him over time that President Trump, through his lawyer, Mr Giuliani, and through actions that he took wanted to extract from the Ukrainians certain politically beneficial investigations"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And at one point, pretty early in his statement, he addresses the Latin phrase that has been confusing everyone"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," If this is going along, Was there a quid pro quo? Was it a quid pro quo of this for that? Or was it not? And, he says, with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes, unequivocally that far as I'm concerned, there was a quid pro quo around the White House meeting, right, and I was struck by how casually he says that this thing that is very much at the center of the entire inquiry and the thing that has been contested by other witnesses"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, He states in a very authoritatively without reservation  Now he's a little bit more cautious about whether or not there was a quid pro quo around the suspended military assistance  In July and August of 2019 we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer  Still haven't to this day"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," So he came to conclude by August that that, too, was dependent on Ukraine announcing these investigations that the president wanted committing to the investigations of the 2016 elections and charisma as Mr Giuliani had demanded"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Now someone has another clear objective is he's laying out his story, and that is to defend himself against the testimony from other witnesses who have tried to describe him as either a rogue actor or somebody that was working through an improper diplomatic channel"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I'm not sure how someone could characterize something as an irregular channel when you're talking to the president, the United States secretary of State the National Security Advisor, the chief of staff of the White House, Secretary of energy  I don't know how that's irregular"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," If a bunch of he says no, this was the real channel  I was working with the president, United States"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I was working with top American diplomats and officials, and not only was it proper, but all of those people knew what I was up to and what we were trying to accomplish as this went along  Within my State Department e mails, there is a July 19th email"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," This email was sent  This email was sent to Secretary Pompeo Secretary Perry Ryan McCormick, who is Secretary Perry's chief of staff at the time"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Basically, you know, if if for weeks we've had witness after witness and certainly the White House and the Republicans willing to throw Gordon someone under the bus to try and push all of this on to him as a kind of lone wolf, I mean, he was taking everybody under the bus with him"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, Chief of Staff Mulvaney and Mr Mulvaneys senior adviser Rob Blair
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," A lot of senior officials these e mails show that the leadership of the State Department, the national security Council and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts, right? He's saying Everybody who now wants to distance themselves from me They were actually all in blue"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," That's right  It's a phrase he uses several times  It was no secret everyone's in  Everyone was in the loop, in bloom again  In the everyone was in the loop, they were in the loop  There was a September 1st meeting with President Zelinsky and Warsaw"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," During the actual meeting, President Zelinsky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice president Pence, and the vice president said that he would speak to President Trump about it  And what's the significance of what he's saying here? I mean, in theory, this is very explosive"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," The vice president, the secretary of state are being in Sahlins testimony directly drawn into this right? He's trying to make the point that this wasn't just me, like everyone understood this to be Trump's objective out of this relationship, and we were all working toward that, and nobody found it unusual that I was doing what I was doing"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip  I wrote Mike, Thanks for schlepping to Europe"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising, really appreciate it, Secretary Pompeo replied the next day on Wednesday, September 4th quote all good  You're doing great work  Keep banging away  And with that, someone completes his opening statement remains an honor to serve"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," The people of the United States is their United States ambassador to the European Union  I look forward to answering the committee's questions, Thank you"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And if the Democrats turn for 45 minutes to begin asking questions, we will now proceed the first round of questions as the chairmanship has a few of his own"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," But mostly he passes the mic over to Dan Goldman, who is his chief investigator, who's been playing a role in these hearings, questioning witnesses directly  Mr"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Goldman, Thank you, Mr Chairman, In your opening statement, Ambassador Sunlen, you detailed the benefits that you have gained from obtaining some additional documents over the past few weeks"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Is that right? In terms of refreshing my recollection that right, because he doesn't shy away from what becomes clear over the course  The day is a pretty shoddy memory on the part of someone you have remembered a lot more then you did when you were deposed"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Is that right? That's correct  And one of the things that, and in doing that, Goldman does something interesting, which is that the ambassador  Taylor also testified under oath that you said that President Trump wanted Zelinski in a public box  Do you recall using that expression? Yeah, goes"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, He repeatedly leans on those witnesses with better memories or people who took contemporaneous notes  Do you have any reason to question Ambassador Taylor's testimony based on his meticulous and careful contemporaneous notes? I'm not gonna question or not question  I'm just telling you what I believe
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I I was was referring to to describe things that someone told them or that describe things that someone did and basically asked someone to confirm that these things happen  Let me fast forward a week and show you another text exchange, which may help refresh your recollection"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," On September 8th, you sent a text to Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker  Can you read what you wrote there to basically bring someone up in tow line with testimony they've gotten from other people about him"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," So you do acknowledge you spoke to President Trump, as you indicated in that text, right? If I said I did, I did"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And that's important as they move towards writing report, and presenting a kind of full case about what happened to the American people helps eliminate some of the discrepancies in the testimony they've gotten"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Which of these exchanges stood out to you? Well, one in particular is fresh in my mind because we just learned about it for the first time last week"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, And one of the things that you now remember is the discussion that you had with President Trump on July 26th in that restaurant in Kiev  Right now
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Remember, that's the day after Trump himself spoke to Zelinski and told them that I want these investigations into the Bidens in 2016 other witnesses have described someone basically speaking on the phone with the president, who was speaking so loud that he had to hold the phone away for his ear"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," He claims to have overheard part of the conversation, and I'm not going to dispute what he did or didn't hear others could over here  President Trump asking about quote unquote the investigations  And Sandlin assured him, you know, don't worry"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," With some expletives laid in, President Zelinsky will do whatever you want, right? Cause Ukraine loves your tush  Uh, something like that  Well, he also testified that President Zelinsky quote loves your ass unquote"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Do you recall saying that? Yeah, it sounds like something I would say, Huh? And what he basically does over the course of this back and forth, is says, putting it in Trump speak by saying he loves your ass"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," He'll do whatever you want, met that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues  You've heard the president  Or that's how President Trump and I communicate a lot of four letter words in this case, three letters  He also contest a couple of small points"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I don't think I would have said that I would have  I would have  But in the end, he confirms the essence of the story as it's been related by other witnesses"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And for the first time, I have established that that happened again, tryingto reconstruct a very busy day without the benefit  But if someone said I had a meeting on, I went to the meeting, then I'm not going to dispute that"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," So it's kind of familiar mix of Sandlin's self protection, lack of recall but overall damning testimony  I think that's right"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," So the Democrats wrap up their questioning, concludes our 45 minutes and after weeks of investigation, literally hundreds of hours of testimony and private and in public, they finally gotten from a lead witness who had direct access to the president statement admission of one of the things that they've been looking for him trying to prove out all along that this White House meeting, an official act, was conditioned upon Ukraine publicly announcing investigations and that someone, a top official, also believed that the withheld aid money that that would only flow to if the investigations were announced"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And so it's with that in front of them  When we take a five or 10 minute break, thank you"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," That shift abruptly gavels the hearing into a pause, someone inexplicably at first, and then we quickly see why, as you walks out behind the chamber, I just want to make a couple quick observations while we're on a break here to a bank of cameras where he begins to talk about"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," What just took place on what we have just heard from Ambassador Song Lynn is that the knowledge of this scheme was a basic quid pro quo, which all of course, carried it live in the middle of the proceedings and when he was done"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, So I think a very important moment in the history of this wrapped up and walked right back into the hearing room and gaveled the thing back in  Decision
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Come to order now for that wasn't lost on Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee who quickly called Schiff out  Thank the gentleman for those of you watching at home, that was not a bathroom break"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," That was actually a chance for the Democrats to go out and hold a press conference  Ambassador for all the supposed bombshells that was in your opening testimony  So there's quite a bit of bad blood, obviously, between the two sides"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, But I don't think that this helped we'll be right back  Support for this podcast and the following message come from uber  Uber is committed to safety and to continuously raising the bar to help make safer journeys for everyone

‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," So once we're back, given that the Democrats have already sort of embraced the messiness and unreliability of Gordon Sandlin and addressed it pretty directly, what is the Republican strategy when it's their turn to question? Well, Republicans air looking at the same guy and the same tendencies, and they see amazing opportunity to weaponize it in defense of the president"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Hello again, ambassador  So it's left to Steve Castor, who's the Republicans lawyer in all of this to start trying to do that work  Just want to go through some distinctions between your your opener"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," In your deposition, there's a phone call that someone has where he says he was getting such mixed signals and couldn't get answers about what Trump wanted from Ukraine and why he was withholding the aid money  And I was getting tired of going around in circles"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Frankly, So I made the call and he asked President Trump, just kind of point blank  What do you want from Ukraine? And that's when I got the answer  He was unequivocal  Nothing, the president tells him  I don't want a quid pro quo  I don't want anything from Ukraine"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, They should just do what's right  They should do  What's Lewinsky said he was gonna do? And Republicans kept going back to this call again and again and again  Not me
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," If there's anything sinister or nefarious in any of this, uh, Vanilla request about corruption called Sam, I'm away to Ukraine  A five minute call you didn't remember  It's significant  A call that you made where the president said, I want nothing  I want no quid pro quo"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I want Zielinski to do the right thing  I want him to do what he ran on and him telling you to go tell Congress the truth, anything sinister or nefarious about any of that, not the way you present okay"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And that because in this case, is they pointed out  You know, when the president is speaking directly to someone, he's saying no quid pro quo  I don't want anything in particular from the Ukrainians"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, And you told Mr Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," In fact, he didn't just not tell you that he explicitly said the opposite for the most senior figure and the most involved figure in all this from the Trump administration who declares that this was a quid pro quo is simultaneously testifying that the president gets on the phone with him and says, This is no quid pro quo That is complicated"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," It is  It's very complicated  And if you're listening at home and listening to Republican questioning their able, I think, to raise some doubts about this account that he's giving  If you pull up CNN today right now, they're  Banner says Sandlin ties Trump to withholding aid"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Is that your testimony today, Mr Master Silent that you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation because I don't think you're saying that  And in this questioning, you know, someone says, I didn't hear anything directly I've said repeatedly, Congressman, I was presuming"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I also said that President Trump, so no one, not just the president Giuliani didn't tell you Mulvaney didn't tell you nobody Pompeo didn't tell you  Nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations  Is that correct? I think I already testified"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, Answer the question  Yes or no? Yes  And why do you think they're so focused on that? What the president hold him versus what he has concluded from all the information and conversations around him
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Republicans argument is basically that if you're going to impeach the president, you know, we need to know directly what his intentions were, what he told you  That's evidence  That's primary, What you concluded  I mean, that's that's no better than what we heard from other witnesses  It's hearsay"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, That's when I noticed it  So you know what hearsay evidence is? Ambassador here stays when I testify What someone else told me  You know what made up testimony is made up
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Testimony is when I just presume it, you're just assuming all of these things, and then you're giving them the end evidence that they're running out of doing press conferences"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, And CNN's headline is saying that you're saying the President of States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations and you don't know that correct? I never said the president  United States should be impeached
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, So as this hearing starts to wind down after five or six hours of this back and forth after a pretty explosive and direct opening statement and then cross examination and examination and more cross examination spirits are starting to flag a little bit in the hearing room  Mr  Maloney
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Mr Master, let's pick up right there  There's an exchange near the end with Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat of New York  Let me ask you something"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president's political opponents? I don't want to characterize who would have been who would not have  I know you don't want to, sir  That's my question  Which would you answer it for me and baloney"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," You know, seeming to kind of burst forth with Democratic frustration that's been boiling beneath the surface all day, basically says, I guess I guess I'm having trouble"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Why? You can't just say When he asked about investigations, I assumed he meant I know what you a symphony, but who would benefit from an investigation of the buttons? I assume President Trump would been there"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," We have it see? Didn't hurt a bit, did it? But let me ask you something, Mr Bologna  Hold on  Excuse me  I've been very forthright, and I really resent what you're trying to  Fair enough  You've been very forthright  This your third try to do so, sir"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, Didn't work so well the first time did it  And now we're here 1/3 time  We got a doozy of a statement from you this morning  There's a whole bunch of stuff you don't recall
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," So all due respect, sir, we appreciate your candor, but let's be really clear on what it took to get it out of you  And that's kind of the tone  As this hearing begins to come to an end, Democrats are frustrated about some things  Republicans are frustrated about something"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Sunlen, who's trying to catch a flight back to Brussels, eyes certainly frustrated by some things  And we've had a pretty complex and conflicting day of testimony where some people seem to be coming away quite happy, but not perfectly so"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," So is this unreliable witness turning out to be the most important witness in this inquiry? Or is he just an unreliable witness? Well, the thing about Solomon is that Democrats will tell you"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," You know, prosecutors successfully bring cases all the time on highway flawed witnesses who maybe don't even have a great history with the truth  But that doesn't mean that what they're saying isn't true in a given scenario"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And in this case, it's important to remember what he's saying is incredibly politically inconvenient for him  He still work for the president, United States  We donated a bunch of money to and whose policies he believes in, that that that itself lends it some power and credibility"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Democrats seem to be emerging from today more comfortable and more certain that they need to bring forward this case of the president, abusing his office of committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of impeachment and putting it before the American people  Thank you, Nick"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Thanks for having Michael for the next few weeks will be covering the latest developments in the impeachment inquiry  In our new podcast, it's called the latest"

‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I left a career in finance to pursue what I love now that I have my own restaurants  I know this was the best decision for me, but it was daunting"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Then what drives us when we're faced with life changing decisions to get a better understanding of the art and science of decision making? I've collaborated with the McAllen, and here's what I learned about the choices that shaped my life"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Follow my story at nytimes dot com slash the McAllen  Here's what else you need to know today how the ambassador suddenly get there  You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications except one  He wrote a shack for a $1,000,000 in the fifth"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," Democratic presidential candidates expressed outrage over Wednesday's testimony in the impeachment inquiry, with Senator Elizabeth Warren accusing President Trump of selling off key ambassadorships to wealthy donors like boarding Sondra And that tells us about what's happening in Washington"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," But with Mayor Pete Footage now leading the polls in Iowa, the first state to pick a Democratic nominee, several of his rivals, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, sought to challenge his credentials and experience just like I have won statewide and mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work is a local official"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," And you did not when you tried  I also have actually done this work  I think experience shouldn't matter  Booted fired back, suggesting that the federal experience of his opponents was its own liability  So first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, Is more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage  And where are we right now? Is a country that's daily  I'm Michel tomorrow  See tomorrow  Sometimes a single moment can change everything
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I used to stay up late at night with my dad watching movies on TV, and one night he cried  Um, Alicia Burke, host of the new podcast that made all the difference"
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’, I talked to achievers like documentary filmmaker Ken Burns about the moments that inspired them to make an impact
‘We Followed the President’s Orders’," I knew that there was some power to film that I wanted to be a part of you confined that made all the difference anywhere you get your podcasts created by Bank of America, what would you like the power to d'oh"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’,"it started with a whistle  Blowers complain about President Trump's contact with a foreign leader  Had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine  Like I mean perfect  Today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," We are joined this afternoon by Ambassador Gordon Sunland  I'm sorry this morning  It was a long day yesterday  Hey, it's Julie Davis in the Washington Bureau of the New York Times  So today we saw the most complicated witness in these impeachment hearings to date, Gordon Sandlin"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’, I expect that few Americans have heard my name before these events  This is the Trump donor turned diplomat  The highest honor in my public life came when President Trump asked me to serve as the United States ambassador to the European Union
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," So right out of the gate in his opening statements, was there a quid pro quo? Sandlin is dropping bombs with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting  The answer is yes, he says yes  There was clearly a quid pro quo"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," I e mailed Secretary Pompeo directly  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo knew what was going on  I mentioned Vice president Pence  Before the meetings, Vice President Mike Pence knew what was going on"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," The suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or robe diplomacy is absolutely false, and there's really no back channel because everyone was in the loop  Everyone was in the loop"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’, It was no secret to Anyone was going on and he had the full buy in of the whole government on this  Everyone was informed via email on July 19 but the latest is It's complicated
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," So far in these hearings, we've been getting testimony from career diplomats, former military types who are very formal in their testimony  They're trained to keep notes  They have extemporaneous notes, They have memos  They have methodical accounts of what happened and documents in some cases to back it up"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," They've got the receipts  As you might say, Sunlen is a totally different type of character  You confirmed to President Trump that President Zelinsky quote loves your ass unquote  Do you recall saying that? Yeah, it sounds like something I would say Here he is"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," This guy is ah, wealthy hotel magnet from Oregon  He's a political donor  He's new to being a diplomat, and he he doesn't have any of those things  The Democrats lawyer Dan Goldman, points this out right away  You are not a note taker, right? Not a note taker"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’, Never have been  Doesn't take notes  He doesn't have this all written down
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," He can't really remember some of the conversations that he's being asked about, but certainly based on the additional memory that you have gained over the past few weeks from reading the testimony of others based on their notes and reviewing your own documents, you have remembered a lot more than you did when you were deposed"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," Is that right? That's correct  Oh, and also he's contradicted his original closed door testimony on multiple occasions in the weeks since he first talked to the House Intelligence Committee  He started out saying there was no quid pro quo in all of this"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," But turns out when someone else testifies that they heard him describe one all of a sudden, he remembers, Yeah, there was one  He did describe that at one point  In short, he's got a credibility problem  It's messy"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," You freely admit that, you know, unless you ask your deposition, we put together a list of all the times you said  You don't recall"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," It's like two pages long, um, so that all so naturally, the Republican lawyer on the Intelligence Committee, Steve Castor, wants to focus on this messiness  And when he gets a chance to question Sunlen, he does just that"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," On a lot of these questions that mean there's nuance there, ambiguities on  We don't have records, We don't have notes, and we don't have recollections  Correct, right? I mean, it's it's situational things, that sort of trigger memory"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," All of these calls thes meetings with very important people tend to sort of blend together until I have someone that can show me what we discussed, what the subject was  Then, all of a sudden it comes back"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," We're trying to get to the fact that we're trying to find out what actually happened  What's reliable, What's accurate  You don't have records  You don't have your notes because you didn't take notes  You don't have a lot of recollections  I mean, this is the like"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," The trifecta of unreliability isn't isn't that true? Well, what I'm trying to do today is to use the limited information"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," I have to be as forthcoming as possible with you and the rest of the committee and as thes recollections have been refreshed by subsequent testimony by some texts and emails that I've now had access to, Um, I think I filled in a lot of blanks, but a lot of it's speculation"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," A lot of it is your guests, And we're talking about, you know, an impeachment of the president of states, so the evidence here ought to be pretty darn good  So outwardly Ambassador Song  That may seem like a terrible witness for the Democrats  He's imprecise, He's unreliable"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," He either doesn't remember things or he doesn't have any proof  But the question in my mind is, might he actually be the most damning witness of all? For the Democrats, He's someone who was friendly with the president  He was talking to the Ukrainians on a fairly regular basis"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," He had an up close view of all of this, and he's willing to make these definitive statements  Reached these big conclusions  Yes, there was a quid pro quo  No, there was no back channel"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," Everybody knew about this so he may not have notes, but does it actually matter? You know, the other thing that was striking about Sahlins testimony was how comfortable he seemed  He seems kind of at ease with the role he's playing in all of this"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," He knows who he is  He's not a career politician  He's not versed in the complicated geopolitics of all of this  He's just landed in the middle of the situation, and he says he's playing the hand he was dealt, and that may seem like someone trying to protect himself"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," Or it could be someone basically trying to come clean  Maybe he's not reliable, but he may be the most important witness Democrats have  Like I said, it's complicated  So that's the latest tomorrow on the daily  More on how the Democrats and Republicans handled this unusual witness"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," Sometimes one moment changes everything  Two years into building half post, I collapsed, Um, Alicia Burke, host of the podcast that made all the difference  I talked to achievers like Arianna Huffington about the moments that inspired them to make an impact"
The Latest: ‘Everyone Was in the Loop’," The medical conclusion was Arianna, you have civilizations, disease, Berna  You have to change your life  Find that made all the difference anywhere you get your podcasts created by Bank of America  What would you like? The power to d'oh"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?,"Hi  Uh, my name is Monica  Stop  Give a and I'm a producer for the daily, and I am here with instead  Instead, introduce yourself  Hi  I'm instead Herndon I'ma politics reporter covering the election  And I'm driving on a very long time"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?, We're driving on a very long highway in South Carolina because we came here  Try to answer on Interesting question  What is the question? What happened? Toe Caramel Harris is presidential campaign that took her from top tier front runner status  So the middle of the pack
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Okay, let's try to figure this out from New York Times  I'm Michaela borrow  This is a daily"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," When Senator Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign 10 months ago, she drew a crowd of 20,000 to her kick off round the biggest of any candidate, and was talked about as a potential heir to the political coalition that carried Iraq Obama to the White House Twice"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Today, she's polling in the single digits  My colleagues, a steady Herndon and Monica went to South Carolina with the Harris campaign"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," It's Wednesday, November 20th instead, and I are in the car we're driving from the capital, Columbia, to Greenwood and Greenwood is a small town suits, you know, this is South Carolina, and why South Carolina essential to heart campaign"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," So she's in South Carolina because, frankly, that's where the campaign is putting their chips  They've had to, after falling on hard times, fire most of their New Hampshire team and really focused"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Their resource is on the first date, Iowa and then South Carolina, where they think they can unlock black support  The thought process here is based somewhat on what Barack Obama did in 2008  That if you win white support in Iowa improves viability"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," It proves electability and that the black voters who like you but are scared you can't win will eventually come around  If you prove yourself in the early states and South Carolina, the electorate's more than 65% black, and she thinks that she shares a real kinship there"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Well, she's been the South Carolina many times before  This is her first time in this community  Her campaign understands the things aren't going well and needs to reach out to people they haven't talked to before  Okay, we're actually working with now what's happening? We get to the building"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?, It's a very small building and its veterans  It's like a veteran tall  There are rows of people kind of set up in 1/2 circle around what will be a panel some people have on their their veterans  Kind of Galya
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," We got flags behind pretty much a standard, intimate political event  Okay, let's go talk to some people way talk to voters  You try to get a sense why they decided to come  You're here today  I'm here to support coming Harris  I'm here to be enlightened about her policies"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Have they decided on a particular candidate? I really am picking a candidate  You know, I haven't made up my mind"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," I'm still shopping, looking at all the options today, you'll be listening to what she has to say, and if she could basically win you over possible, it's possibly hit  A lot of people actually don't know a lot about her  Some people don't know anything about her"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," I really don't know where he was not there before  I think that's something people forget about voters  Not everyone is tuned in all the time that I really have been watching the news  You know, I don't think I washed the debate as a matter fact"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," I know I didn't I didn't watch  They know the field is large and they know kind of generally who's up and who's down  And in every conversation we have with these voters, this is still the South Race keeps coming up"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," You have to remember the context for these largely older African American brothers and good law willing and the creek don't rise  Come March of next year, I'll be 70 years old  So I've seen a lot, and basically, I still see the world has been one great big plantation"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," These are folks who have grown up in the shadow of Confederacy their whole lives  They have lived under the brunt of Jim Crow, some of them, and that informs how they're making pragmatic political decisions moving forward within sound"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Kanada, within the African American community way, don't want to take a chance on someone that doesn't have a chance of beating Trump  So things like 2008 and Barack Obama defied their wildest dreams"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," It was an anomaly to them, and so they're still ah, fear of risk that a lot of them associate with a person of color, leading the ticket  I hope she's electable, but we have to change the minds of the people fear"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," That may be in this time where black voters are very worried about the Trump presidency, that a black candidate or a woman of color was too risky  Do you think that black men have will have problems supporting a black woman can? Yes"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Why do you think so, Man have been the head  Many people we speak don't mention as an alternative don't bite  You know, I think that he's a good candidate  Joe Biden Joe  How was her body? I've looked at Joe Biden"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?, Why? There's a lot of reasons why Joe by then looms over South Carolina  One is name recognition because he had been vice president and I don't think you know someone now  That's the only job training
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," He has a track record because he was there in administration before they know who he is  He's a known quantity, and he is someone who has long standing relationships in those communities  He has to debate experience, and I feel like you can go after muscle"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Another reason is he has pitched himself as the candidate who is most likely to beat Trump  Something kind of explicit, like when you say that he then he could be Trump"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Do you think that's because white people are more likely to vote for Joe Biden than they are in the boat for camel hair? Yes, yes  And so this is one of the big challenges Harris has to overcome even black voters who sometimes like her instinctively"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," I think that her identity as a black woman might be a liability for the election  And so they see Joe Biden, a white men with experience in the White House"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," And even this community thinks that maybe he is better suited to be Trump, and ultimately, that's what they care about the most  So again, we thank each one of you for taking time out of your business schedule coming out today, and without further ado, it gives me great"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Then the event actually kicks off their several introductions  The U S senator from the Great State of California, the animal Kamala Harris and after some time, it's her time to speak, and she needs to convince the people in this room that she's uniquely positioned to represent them best"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?, What are some of the key points she makes in this speech  Please have a seat  So I will tell you
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," My background is I am a daughter of parents who met when they were active in the civil rights movement in the 19 sixties in Berkeley and Oakland, California She introduces herself to the audience of her personal narrative"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?, I grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting for justice  And then she turns very quickly to an issue  She has gotten a lot of criticism for her position on health care
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," So I'm running for president to put in place, Ah, Medicare for all plan, which means everyone will be covered, including people with preexisting conditions  And for her healthcare looks like what she calls a Medicare for all plan  That's still preserves a role for the private insurance industry"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," And this is confusing, right? It can't be  She's had different positions on health care  She started the race as a co sponsor and Bernie Sanders Medicare fraud bill, which is a single payer system that eliminates private insurance"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?, But she kind of him didn't hauled about the specifics of that bill and then eventually offers her own plan
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," I'm not trying to get rid of private insurance, so I heard from too many folks who said Comma, don't take away our choice, which preserves a role for private insurance"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," And so this is another one of the issues people site around Kamila Harris is campaign is that when you look at key policies, if you look at health care, the number one issue for Democrats in this race she has not always stood for a singular position"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," She's tried to have her cake and needed to, some voters say  Even now, as she's in between the progressive and moderate approaches, she's still borrowing language from that progressive lane  We want the choice between a private plan or a public plan"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Well, my plan will give you the choice that you deserve  And this is why I was a little bit confused when I hear her say that you're not the only one  But we need reasonable gun safety laws, including universal background checks"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," So she goes through some other issues that are important to the Democratic voters, like gun safety, the challenges facing veterans putting them out of business when they were targeting our veterans, but then and I'm just going to share with you one last thing"

They again point to her identity"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?, She's been erased by the media  She's been misrepresented by the media  They blame media for preferring often white candidates over people of color  And they point to a top tier where the four candidates at the top are all white now with the Democratic Party
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," I mean, she's a black woman in a race that everyone's looking for a white savior candidate  And so, um, but I think, don't count her out  She's got a strong ground game and the event kicks off with a couple of introductions, including from a high school student"

What Happened to Kamala Harris?, And remember those zero nothing brokers like Housing and Equality and Equitable education issues that matter to older black voters  You don't have to go and get a loan from one of those private companies that are charging these outrageous interest rates
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," I'll take some of the equity out of my home to help you pay for tuition  So thank you very much  After the speech, we see something that I haven't experienced so far  A pastor starts a prayer for her  She's literally holding her hands and the whole room"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Everyone is standing up  Dave, when you that ought to do about this, I already knew that you would dress after that  They need war  It wasn't next  This is one of the cool things you can see while campaigning specifically in South Carolina"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Because the Democratic electorate is so black and because the black electorate, particularly southern states, air so religious  A lot of the campaigning happens through thes religious communities"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Pastors and black communities are not just religious leaders, their community leaders, their political leaders there, cultural hubs and particularly with black candidates  There's like a sense of kinship  There she will you  I pray that you are every car that she journeys"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," May I ask you to be tried every fund that she would think I asked you to be  History Caramel Harris is a religious woman, and there is a shared language of faith that happens at these events that you see with other candidates"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?, It's not like they wouldn't pray for a white cat  But there's something different when it's someone who they know has worshipped in their churches for their whole lives  And so she prays for her
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," And she mentions that the last presidential candidates he prayed for, that I laid my hands on him  Afraid for in the presidential election was Barack Obama Morocco  The Reverend is Reverend Gatson, but you goes by pastor teeth so we could declare"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," They call me Pastor T the Reverend Kelly Lynette gets and we actually catch up with her after the prayer  You know, that was your first time seeing the senator I imagined my first time seeing, but not first time hearing about and then we ask her about the race"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Have you? Are you someone who personally has, like, I made a decision about who you want? Oh, I have not  I have not  And that's been because the field is so wide, you know"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," But where I am, as I've shared, is just a posture of, first of all, praying for our country"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," What? You can see how that represents a problem for cardinal hairs way have this pastor who says she last laid hands on Barack Obama but isn't ready to give her support to Kamala Harris, someone who started this race so strongly by trying to capture the same kind of coalition that Obama did"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?, We've heard that the challenges to her campaign are her identity and the lack of clarity on policy  But those same things could have been set for Obama
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," So what's different in 2019 the Barack Obama coalition that he rose to power with combined young people, liberals and historic turnout for black people? And there's not one candidate in this race that has yet been ableto win those different demographic groups"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," And that was supposed to be common hairs  I mean, it was supposed to be a number of people  It could have been better or could have been  Cory Booker could have been Kirsten Gillibrand"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," But when we entered this race, the thought the reason why her candidacy was so feared was because she was thought to be the one who could most quickly tap in to that coalition  Well, there are differences that we knew would be true from the start"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," And there's things that we've learned over the last 68 months from the start, we knew that as a black woman running, she would have no historical Touchstone and she would face unique barriers"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," And I think if you asked the campaign, they would say, That's true, But it's really about messaging"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," We knew that this race would be defined by a progressive wing led by figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and a moderate wing led by Joe Biden, and that people like Hamlet Harris would have to exist threading both worlds  And that's been difficult"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," When you talk to voters, the most consistently repeated thing is, well, I don't necessarily know what she stands for, and I think that is born out of those two wings  The progressive and moderate wings defining this primary through their fight"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," And so Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can say, If you aren't with single payer health care, you're not a progressive  If you're not willing to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, then you will have big ideas"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," And the moderate Wing has defined themselves by rejecting that bye defined themselves by saying, Well, we can't do that or we won't be Trump"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," But if you're trying to do both of those things, if you're trying to thread in between those worlds, we have seen electorates that aren't really willing to give people that benefit of the doubt  And that's driving a lot of the anxiety right now, particularly among the party's moderates"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?, And that's why we see all these new candidates jump in the race
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," The anxiety breeds uh, um, restlessness, right? And Deval Patrick, who just announced Mike Bloomberg, who's expected to, are trying to capitalize on that anxiety because in the circles that like the in the circles of elite Democratic moderates, they are a group that expected to have more options"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Not that surprised at the way Joe Biden's candidacy has turned out were the biggest surprises is they thought they would have an alternative figure to Joe Biden, who could replicate that Obama lane"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Now remember, these are a group of people who think that Warren and Sanders progressive policies will lose them the general election  They think that Warren and Sanders, if they are the nominee, will struggle to bring out the type of people that put Democrats over the top"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," And without that, without someone in the top tier who is winning black voters and exciting young voters at the same time, there is fear that you cannot replicate what Obama did"
What Happened to Kamala Harris?," Now their argument is that that's because of the campaigns that this individual candidates and individual campaigns haven't done the things necessary  Thio produce that support, but it could be because of a changing electorate and two wings of the party that just aren't looking for emerging savior anymore"

A Broken Promise on Taxes,"from The New York Times  I'm Michael Bavaro  This is the daily Today  As they lobbied the Trump administration for a $1 5 trillion tax cut, corporations promised that they would invest the savings right back into the U  S  Economy  Jim Tankers investigates whether that actually happened"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," It's Tuesday, November 19  All Americans  I say it's time for change in time for leadership  Just think about what we can accomplish In the 1st 100 days of the Trump administration  We're going to have the biggest tax  Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, Donald Trump had promised he was going to cut taxes
A Broken Promise on Taxes," We are proposing major tax relief for the middle class and lowering the business tax from 35% all the way down to 15% big tax cuts for individuals and especially for businesses, which he said was going to revitalize the American economy as a big part of his economic program"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And you will see companies expand companies come back into our country  Companies not leave our country anymore because taxes and regulations or so owners, it's one of his top priorities  He gets into office, his team starts working on it but it's not what they do first in Congress"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Finally, we want a very big tax cut, but cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obama care  But they try to do first is repeal Obamacare this morning  Republicans are fighting to pass a new health care plan"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Right now, House Republicans just don't have enough votes to pass the replacement to Obamacare  And in the spring of 2017 that effort is not going well  And neither is Trump's tax plan went on well"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, The version of the tax bill that Republicans are working on has some big opponents in the business community
A Broken Promise on Taxes, And there's a real question over whether they can actually craft a bill that passes muster with enough folks in Congress and with the business community and makes it all the way to President Trump's desk and he'll sign it
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Remember this feeling like a perilous moment for this young presidency? It's struggling to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and it is struggling to convince people to support its tax cuts  Right"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," There's a lot of discord within the Republican Party as to what works when it comes to tax reform  And when it comes to health care six months into his term, he has exactly zero big legislative accomplishments to boast about it"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," If there's one thing you would have expected a Republican president with Republican majorities to be able to do, it's past a big tax cut on  Yeah, we're at this moment in the spring when that looks like that might not happen and into the breach of that steps"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, Fred Smith and who is Fred Smith? Fred Smith is a former Marine who went to Yale and wrote a famous paper in a class that imagines a new type of company that is so wild in its imagination that he gets a C on the paper
A Broken Promise on Taxes," But he turns around and takes the basis of what he has sketched out on the paper into a company and builds it into FedEx America  You've got a new airline  There's no first class, no meals, no movies, enormous multinational shipping conglomerate and delivery company Federal Express"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And how exactly does the founder of FedEx, Fred Smith, get involved in this? Well, he has been an advocate for lower corporate tax rates for a really long time"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And now he sees this opportunity with President Trump, a real ally of corporate tax cuts in the White House, to push this plan he's been working on for years  And he does something more than just pushed the idea of tax cuts into the public discourse"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," He and his team, it Fed action, actually write their own plan  Wow, their own tax proposal"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, And what's in this Fred Smith plan? The FedEx plan is really centered around a big cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% and some extra carrots for businesses to be ableto right new investments off their taxes right away
A Broken Promise on Taxes, So two things that Fred Smith and a lot of other executives say are going to spur a renaissance of business investment in America  The fundamental problem with U  S  Tax code is that it punishes invest
A Broken Promise on Taxes," The argument is that the United States was being held back in its economy by a lack of business investment, and at the end of the day, investment is produced high paying job"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, The company's just weren't spending money that they were sitting on basically in they weren't spending it on capital spending that economists  He is very important to economic growth  You make the United States a better place to invest
A Broken Promise on Taxes," There is no question in my mind that we would see a renaissance of capital investment, a growth in GDP and an increase in income for our blue collar work force"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, What kind of investments is Fred Smith talking about when we talk about capital investments? What do we mean we're talking about? Plants were talking about equipment in FedEx is case we're talking about airplanes for transportation hub or new technologies that can help to deliver or sort packages faster
A Broken Promise on Taxes," So something that can help you make your business run more efficiently  That's the kind of thing that economists think of as big, productive capital investments God, And the reason that would help the rest of the economy is someone has to build that plant"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, Someone has to build that plane  It just ripples across  It ripples across for a couple of reasons  One creates demand for those products that are being invested in which yes need to be built and need to be installed or or flown or whatever
A Broken Promise on Taxes," But the other real argument is, is that having these new technologies put in place helps workers do more  Investment is the only way to make blue collar workers people that don't have college degrees more productive and and have more income"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," So you can hire six people to move a pile of dirty  You can hire one person with the bulldozer, the differences, the bulldozer"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," The bulldozer driver makes a lot more money than the people with shovels, and the argument was that companies weren't doing that because their profits were taxed too heavily"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And it was more profitable for them to invest in other countries then in the United States, because America's tax rates weren't competitive"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," It's just like us playing basketball and on our end of the court, were playing with a 12 foot basket and everybody else that we compete with around the world of shooting on a 10 foot basket"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Fred Smith makes this very clear promise, saying, If we cut corporate tax rates, businesses are going to start investing again in America, and the economy is going to grow faster, and that's gonna help workers and everyone"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Jim, how skeptical are people of the Fred Smith School of thinking here that big corporate tax cuts will lead to big investments in the economy and to a lot of growth in the U  S  Well, a huge part of Washington is not skeptical it all"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," They are pushing this  The Trump administration Republicans in Congress, many sort of economists who support tax reform are arguing to one degree or another that there will be Maur investment lots more if you just cut the corporate tax rate"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," There is, though, this dissenting group, including a lot of Democrats and liberal economists who make the argument that, hey, companies have a lot of money  They don't need lower taxes to have just a little bit more money to invest it  If they want to invest it, they can"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," It's sitting right there on their balance sheets, and cutting their taxes is not going to dramatically increase investment, because that's not what's holding them back  And I'm curious  Jim"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," How much was FedEx paying in corporate taxes at the time that Fred Smith was making this argument? So throughout the time that he's making this argument, FedEx is paying what it calls in its financial filings and effective tax rate of about 33 or 34% which is a lot in the just the fiscal year 2017 alone"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," It paid more than $1 5 billion in taxes  So that's a meaningful tax bill  It's a meaningful tax bill  And it's close to the top corporate tax rate in America, which is 35% before the trump tax cuts past"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," So what happens to the Fred Smith the tax plan? The tax plan arrives in Washington and gets a warm reception, and it injects energy in what had been a little bit of a stalled process, brightening prospects of a major tax cut, especially for corporations"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And it helps open the door again  For all of the champions of tax reform, toe work together for a new bill and as a Christmas gift to all of our hard working families"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," We hope Congress will pass massive tax cuts for the American people so Republicans get back on track on the tax bill, particularly spurred on by the fact that they fail completely to repeal the Affordable care act  So now this is it"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," The business community is back on board, their lobbying hard  The Trump administration is working key details out with congressional negotiators  President Trump is heading to Capitol Hill today to boost momentum for the tax reform bill that could become his first legislative victory"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," We enter the fall, the House passes  A version of the bill debate is still happening on the Senate floor, but this bill does appear to be gaining momentum  The Senate narrowly passes a version of the bill with no Democrats supporting it  And then they put them together"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And the final proposal includes the really big corporate rate cut, basically, just like what Fred Smith and FedEx had proposed  And it includes a bunch of other incentives for investment  Also like FedEx it proposed  And then, of course, the bill passes Bill passes"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," I do vaguely recall in my fever dreams from that time period of working 20 hour days that the bill did pass and the president did sign it into law  The corporate tax rate is, you know, will be lowered from 35 to 21%"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, That means that more products will be made in the U  S  A  A lot of things are going to be happening in the USA  We're gonna bring back our companies that they've already started coming back  I think they had certain confidence in me
A Broken Promise on Taxes," They figured we're gonna get this done  This law includes individual tax cuts  It includes some other provisions, but the centerpiece  The thing it was sold on was the idea that we would reinvigorate economic growth in America, and it would do that by supercharging business investment"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," It's almost hard to understate just how often and vocally Republicans and the president made that case to voters that this is what American business and the American economy needed from, or domestic investment"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," So once this bill passes, what is? FedEx is tax bill? How much does it save? So the bill passes and FedEx files financial statements for the fiscal year 2018 at the end of the year"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And it shows that rather than paying one point five billion like it paid the last year, it actually was owed money by the government  It has a negative, effective tax rate  What? Yeah, negative  5%  So less than zero less than zero Wow"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And how much of that savings? 1 5 plus 1,000,000,000 is attributable to this tax bill, all of it over the 1st 2 years after the tax law, we can count 1 6 $1,000,000,000  That's a pretty staggering figure"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," But then again, we know that FedEx plans to use that money to reinvest in the American economy  So that's the story that FedEx told before the law passed  But the story that played out is different"

A Broken Promise on Taxes," What happened with all this money that FedEx saved from this tax cut? That it played such a huge role in shaping? FedEx had said, you know, up to the eve of the bill being signed that they were gonna use the money to increase investment, but they didn't"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Investment actually went down compared to what they had projected, and then the next year it went down again  So what did FedEx do with these savings? If they were not investing it in the kind of things that we all thought they would  Well, it largely rewarded its shareholders"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," It increased dividends, which is the money it regularly pays, people who own it stock  And it bought back shares of that stock, which has the effect of pushing up prices of the stock for the people who own it"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Now, to be clear, it did some good things for its workers to it accelerated some raisins  It increased the size of its workforce  It made a large contribution to its pension plan  But the big winner were shareholders"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, And that's a group that is largely if you look at who owns stock in America skewed toward the very wealthy
A Broken Promise on Taxes, So the promise the FedEx made that they would invest much of the savings from this tax cut into the kind of projects that would benefit everyday workers across the economy
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Instead, the benefit of the way they use this money really went toe people who are largely already pretty well off  In the short term, that seems very clear"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Why do you think that the text did I had a lot of questions for FedEx about how they spent their tax money  I tried to ask them of executives over a period of a couple months, I was never granted an interview with an executive"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," I sent very detailed questions, including one very similar to the one you just asked  Most of them went unanswered  I would love to hear FedEx explanation of how it has made the decisions it's made with its tax cut windfall  Jim"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, How typical was this for companies that received these big savings from the tax cuts that they did not use to invest? And instead they used it to buy back shares or pay dividends? It was very typical
A Broken Promise on Taxes, My colleagues and I did a few different analyses to sort of demonstrate just how widespread this type of behavior was  And here's a few ways of looking at it
A Broken Promise on Taxes, One is that companies increased share buybacks and dividends by about triple as much as they increased investment following the tax cuts  Wow! Another is that investment has now grown more slowly since the tax cuts under President Trump
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Then it grew before the tax cuts under President Trump, which is another way of saying that the central claim of the tax cuts and how they would be used and how it would benefit the economy that has just not come to pass  It is not Jim"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," If these companies were to call you back and you were able to ask what they're thinking was, would there be an argument from a company like FedEx about why the way it chose to use this money is wise and will benefit the American economy? Absolutely"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," The argument goes like this First off, rewarding shareholders is just another way to increase investment because those shareholders will use that money to invest in different companies who will use that money productively"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," The other argument is that it's just too soon to tell the effects of tax cuts on investment that basically what changes for cos when you cut their tax rate is not, oh, they get a bunch of money today"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," It's that investments tomorrow pay off even more because the profits you get back, you pay less taxes on  And so we would expect overtime to Seymour Investment not right away"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, Is there any truth to that? Are these arguments from the company's about how they use this money accurate that eventually will really help the economy I think there are mechanical truths that you can see to those arguments
A Broken Promise on Taxes," But it's also true that this is all really complicated and that this was sold as a very simple relationship  Cut the taxes, investment will increase"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, And just the fact that we're not seeing that happen right away flies in the face of the arguments that were used to sell the bill  I think that's really important here
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Is that yes, it may be true that investment over time is slightly more competitive in America because of a reduction in marginal business tax rates  But that was not what President Trump stood up at rallies and talked about"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," He talked about, you know, growing the American economy by 3456% a year because of all this flood of investment  Come back to the United States and we just don't see it"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Jim, why is this important? At the end of the day, I mean, these companies successfully lobbied for a tax cut  They got it  It's their money"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," Theoretically, can't they just do what they want to do with it? Whatever that is, I think it's important to hold politicians and their supporters accountable for the promises they make, particularly when those promises have Rhea World implications"
A Broken Promise on Taxes, The economy is not performing as well as we were promised it would when the tax cuts were passed  It's not growing as fast  It doesn't have as much investment
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And if you believe the arguments that were made to sell this, that's hurting workers because slower growth is keeping their incomes from rising as fast as they should be  So real people are suffering from not having that additional growth that they were promised they would have"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And now don't  And then there's this  One last thing which is visible comes at a cost  It's not free to just give money back to corporations by cutting their tax bills, despite what the proponents said, which was that the law would pay for itself the additional growth"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," What we're actually seeing is a massive hundreds of billions of dollars a year effect to grow the federal budget deficit, and last year that deficit came very close to topping $1 trillion"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," And how big or rule is the tax cut flame in that ballooning deficit? It is the primary driver of additional deficits beyond what we had already before the law was passed  Jim, thank you very much, thank you"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," In a statement, FedEx criticized The Times reporting about its tax savings and investments, but offered no specific factual objections  In the statement, the company's founder and CEO, Fred Smith, challenge the publisher of The Times to a public debate about federal tax policy in Washington"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," In response, a spokeswoman for The Times dismissed the request as a stunt and a quote effort to distract from the findings of our story, We'll be right back"
A Broken Promise on Taxes," What if your email let you see a projects entire history and not just the messages sent to you? What if everyone else on your team could see it as well, then it wouldn't be email it all  Move communication from inboxes two channels in Slack"

The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings,it started with a whistle  Blowers complain about President Trump's contact with a foreign leader  Had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine  Like I mean perfect
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," Today I'm announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry drama expected on Capitol Hill this week with the most crucial testimony yet  At least eight witnesses are scheduled to testify this week in public hearing  Hey, it's Julie Davis"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," It's Week two of the impeachment inquiry, and we're preparing for tomorrow's hearings when we're going to hear from four witnesses all on the same day and Knick fan does  Our congressional reporter is going to be there"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," He's on Capitol Hill right now, preparing to take in all this new testimony and try to digest it and figure out where we are  So I'm gonna give him a call and see what he's thinking about what we can expect  Daily Press  Hi"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," Can I talk to Nick? Fan does, Please  One moment  Let me see where he is  There's usually good hold music with one moment  Uh, this is Nick  Hey, Nick, it's Julie  Hey, Joy  So let's talk about how tomorrow's gonna go  Why do we have four witnesses"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," Last week, on the first day, there were two Bill Taylor and George Kent, and Taylor really was the standout witness  He was the one who attracted all the attention George Concert about Lost in the Shuffle  And then on the second day, Marie Evanovich was by herself"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," You know, it was just her on the panel, and that seemed to really open up a lot of room for Democrats to draw out her story in a compelling way  And so I'm just kind of wondering why I called for people on the same day"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," So I think that there's a couple reasons, the main one being that Democrats just feel like they're in a time crunch houses out for Thanksgiving next week, and I think they want to move through out of these people quickly"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," The other thing is that tomorrow there's technically two hearings, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and the afternoon is just two witnesses that the Republicans have requested  And they're pretty ticked off, frankly, that those witnesses got shoved in the afternoon"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," That's when typically, attendance is pretty poor for congressional hearings  People aren't gonna be tuning in so much  So they're accusing Democrats of tryingto bury those witnesses that happened to them last week with their questioning, right"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," Like they didn't get to do the questioning till the afternoon when the viewership was way down  Yeah, totally  And I think they go into the evening  This time will be the worst"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," So who are these four people testifying tomorrow? Has has that gonna work? It's Lieutenant Colonel Alexander of Inman, was the top Ukraine expert at the White House and was very alarmed by phone call that he overheard between President Trump and the Ukrainian president"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," Another witness works for Mike Pence, the vice president  She also wasn't in on the call  She didn't think it was great testified that you thought was improper, but did not raise her concerns in the same wave Inman did"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," And then in the afternoon, you've got Vin Mons Boss Morrison on the National Security Council at the White House, and Kurt Volker, who was the special envoy to Ukraine and was one of the so called three amigos who were like deputized by President Trump to run Ukraine policy last week"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," We really heard about kind of the context in which this call happened  You know, career diplomats who talked about how they felt pushed aside by Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sandlin, and to some degree, Volker himself in a way that allowed this call toe happen"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," What's interesting to me about tomorrow is it seems like we're sort of circling back to the July 25th Call the thing that started this whole saga, the thing that touched off the whistle blower complaint"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," You have people who listened in in real time to President Trump and the president of Ukraine  Three out of the floor, I think  Right, we're on that call  Yeah, that's right"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings, So I think we're gonna hear really different impressions of that phone call ve Inman was really alarmed by it and when and raised is concerned immediately with White House lawyers and that it would fits the frame of a cover up that the White House immediately tried to move to lock down this transcript because they knew was problematic
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," Morrison, on the other hand, is going to talk about how he didn't see anything improper with the call and did suggest that it ought to be locked down, but only because he thought it might be in this polarized environment might be politically unflattering to the president"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings, So we're gonna hear a lot about what the White House was thinking during this consequential call that will both kind of push against the president's characterization that it was perfect and then also maybe lend a little bit of authority behind that claim
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings, So who is the single witness your most eager to hear from? And what do we want to hear from them? Kurt Volker
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," He was the first witness who did a private interview with lawmakers more than a month ago now and basically at the time told them Ah, lot of details that themselves were not flattering for the president that have helped them assemble their story"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," But his own conclusion was that there had not been a quid pro quo  And so, you know, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since he testified"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," A lot of other witnesses have come forward that have made him look either like willfully ignorant, dense like he may have been misleading the committee  Who knows? So I'm really curious"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," Does his testimony evolve it all? And if so, that could be a big blow to the president and his defense because they really leaned on him"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," Or does he stick to his guns and say, I was deeply involved in all of this? I worked closely with Gordon's on land  I spoke with Rudy Giuliani, spoke with the president, and I don't think that there was, in the end, any quid pro quo"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," And in that case, I think the Republicans would be pretty policed with him  Great  Well, thanks, toxin  Thanks, Joy"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," Okay, So I should also mention that the other big story today that relates to all of this is that we learned that lawmakers in the impeachment inquiry are actually investigating whether President Trump lied in the written answers he gave during the Mueller investigation"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings, So House impeachment investigators are looking at this question officially now  And the reason that that's interesting is because there's been a lot of questions
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings, And there's been a lot of debate internally among House Democrats about whether they even want to go there and deal at all with the Mueller investigation when they get to drafting articles of impeachment about this Ukraine affair
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings, There had been a thought early on that they should stay focused just on Ukraine just on this clear allegation that they're looking at right now about whether the president abused his power
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," But now this brings back this question of whether the president's conduct and in this case, whether the president's actual truthfulness in the Mueller investigation is going to be an issue for impeachment articles in the House"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," And that's an open question, and we still don't know the answer yet, so we're following that, too  So that's the latest  Sometimes one moment changes everything  Two years into building half Post, I collapsed a militia Burke, host of the podcast that made all the difference"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings," I talked to achievers like Arianna Huffington about the moments that inspired them to make an impact  The medical conclusion was, Arianna, you have civilizations, disease, Berna  You have to change your life  Find that made all the difference anywhere you get your podcasts created by Bank of America"
The Latest: The Week Ahead in the Impeachment Hearings, What would you like the power to? D'oh

The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," The story of we work really starts with a man named Adam Newman thing growing up in Israel watching American television and movies, I believed that the American dream is get a degree, get a great job, have lots of fun, make lots of money  He was born in Israel"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," He moved to New York  I majored in entrepreneurship and marketing, and he started all of these sort of fly by night entrepreneurial ideas  One of them was genius  Idea was gonna be a women's high heel shoe with the collapsible Hill women's high heels with collapsible heels  Another one"

The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," There were a lot of people, had a lot of startup ideas  Silicon Valley was booming, and you needed a place to work outside your parentsbasement  It lets people rent out a desk or a private office equipped with amenities like Internet coffee and spacious common areas  They were sleek"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," They had community space sofas all over the place  For team building, there was cold brew calm  Boucha, taco  Tuesdays  There was beer and wine on tap  Instead of going out for a drink, you'd stay at the office"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," It really came to symbolize the kind of start up entrepreneurial hustle of millennials  Other words  This kind space was perfectly timed for a generation of people who didn't see themselves as office workers, but as individual businesses and entrepreneurs who needed a place to do that"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Exactly way work is the office space of tomorrow  The future is about light innovation  Creativity is going from me way give you space that will inspire you, uplift you and help you innovate products off tomorrow  So in Adam's mind, this was a community company"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," His mission was to elevate the world's consciousness  He would talk about this, so he grew up partly on a kibbutz in Israel, and he would talk about it as a capitalist kibbutz"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," It was this mix of like capitalistic hustle with this yearning for communal meaning, Adam Newman would say that he wanted  We worked to create a world where people don't just make a living, they make a life and they make a life in these we work"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Office is exactly the thing Adam Newman is really best at is communicating his vision, convincing people that he can change the way we work and live  He fully adopted the persona of the iconoclasts startup founder, and he looks apart"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," You know, it's six foot five with flowing brown hair  You know, people looked up to him when he walked in a meeting with people  They literally paid attention to him"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," But the most important person who bought into his vision is a Japanese executive, the head of a company called Softbank  The thing is, you know, I have a vision held Masayoshi, son  Everyone calls him Masa  We go and change the world together"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Massages, company, overseas something called the Vision Fund  Thinking about what is the future? What is the how we can change the life of people for the better humanity thing  This is the largest tech investment fund in the world"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," They have $100 billion to play with, largely from the Saudis who want to diversify away from oil and invest in tech  And Masa is this very interesting character who's always trusted his gut"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork, One of the investments you made is considered by many people to be the most successful investment in the history of mankind  You invested roughly $20 million in Alibaba at the time it went public  It was worth roughly $90 billion
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," What is it that made you feel this was worth putting in $20 million? Well, he had no business plan, but his eyes was very strong  Strong eyes thrown, shining eyes  Uh, And so he meets Adam Newman  Adam Newman gives Masa a tour of his offices"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork, This includes the right soundtrack in the background and all the sleek office space and virtual reality renderings of we work office space in the future
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," So you could wear these glasses and feel like you're standing in Tokyo or Shanghai, right down to looking out the street and seeing the scene that you would see from the offices  And this really blows Mosses mind  He loves this vision  He loves Adam's energy  You know both"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork, We work and thought bank a vision fund or shoot the moon operations
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," So So after a 12 minute tour of the We work offices and Adam Newman's vision, basically both willing to make humongous bets and they're sort of enabling one another Masa son invest over $4 billion in we work  And by the way, I work in a we work"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," So we were I hear they have good drinks on tap  David, this is an enormous investment, and he doesn't say, Adam, I need you to be very careful steward of this extremely important investment  Be careful with my money  Instead, he says, I need you to go crazier"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," I need you to do more  I need you to explore your wildest visions, he said  That he says, go as far as you can with this, and there's more money where this came from"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," So just how wild does Adam Newman go with this $4 billion investment we're at? We work in Austin, Texas, right now  He started opening  We works all over the country office at Crystal City  We were just opened up today"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Every major American city had a wee work new office space, which is in the We work in Long Beach, California and then he expanded massively abroad"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," I feel like I remember this moment because I woke up one day and had a long walk around Manhattan and there was a we work at every single Laurel Taylor building  Absolutely, they became ubiquitous  We work now is 45 million square feet of real estate"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," It's the largest private landlord in New York, Washington and London"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," And then giant companies started also moving their employees into we work offices, thinking it's a draw for employees to work in these spaces, like which companies horizon, sales force, IBM all moved a lot of employees until we work"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Office space is this is the point when Adam really leans into Mosses advice, which is to go wild, pursue your craziest dreams"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," He opens at we live apartment building and wants to expand that, he says These are places that will have community and cut down on the suicide rate because people never feel alone  He was talking about  We grow and he and his wife opened a school in downtown Manhattan"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," There was we bank, there was we sail  There was  We sleep  There was talk of an airline  We fly, we fly  Presumably there was talk of we Mars even putting office space on the Red Planet  That really is wild  It was wild  So Adam Newman becomes fantastically rich"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," He also indulges his eccentricities, and he was known to walk around the office barefoot  But now he's installed a private plunge pool in his office, a cold plunge on infrared sauna in his office  He has a white May back"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," He's like blaring hip hop as this chauffeured white Maybach takes him all over Manhattan  He also convinced the company to buy a $60 million private plane, Um, which he and other executives  Hot box  I'm sorry"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," That's, you know, getting high in a confined space with marijuana smoke filling the cabin tequila  Adam Newman loved his Don Julio tequila  He would even get people who didn't seem the tequila type like Jared Kushner to take tequila shots at nine in the morning"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Well, they were scoping out some real estate in Philly, but employees said that there was just free flowing booze all the time  A lot of marijuana, a lot of these summer camp kind of weekend retreats"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," People would get drunk and they dance around a fire, singing to journey and other sort of Animal house antics, but always infused with this like larger purpose  Adam would get on stage with, like Deepak Chopra and address employees"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork, And it was this culture of we work that was very specific to kind of Adam's vision for the company  So Amy is Adam Newman becomes this larger than life character
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," As we work as opening offices all over the United States all over the world, and is this term we start to get applied to all areas of life, our people starting to question whether this is getting just a little too big and whether it's all kind of adding up"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," By and large, people looked at what Adam had accomplished  We work on every corner as you said, taking over iconic buildings, and they believed in what he was selling"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," And then on top of that, you throw in Masa, this Japanese tycoon who had made a fortune investing early on in these founders Alibaba, Yahoo uber just based on gut instincts"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," And if he believed in Adam, why shouldn't everyone else So we work? Does what successful startups do They prepare to go public, meaning they can sell their shares to the public? There's evaluation on the company of $47 billion"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," That makes it the most valuable startup in the country and part of going public  They have to disclose everything in paperwork, and that's when things start to unravel  We'll be right back at the daily"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," The headline is just the beginning, just like how it 80 p payroll is just the beginning, because they also provide industry leading HR talent, time benefits and more informed by data and designed for people so you and your company can achieve what you're working for to get the full story on how a teepee is designing a better way to work"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Visit design 0 80 p dot com A teepee always designing for people way work, just unveiling its profiling"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," So why did things start to unravel when we work files office paperwork to go public? So this is the first time that journalists, investors, the public can really look under the hood at what's going on and we work"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Do we have any numbers in terms of how much money that make you losing right now? And it's not pretty  Net losses were just under a $1,000,000,000 904 million  The company had lost $900 million in the first half of 2019 alone"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," They had rapidly expanded into markets that weren't necessarily friendly  Toe we work, and there had also been some kind of questionable financial dealings between Adam and the company that he started  Like what? While he had trademarked the word we and sold it back to the company for $5"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork,9 million he ended up returning that money  But that certainly raised eyebrows  He had bought a lot of the buildings that we work was now leasing  So the company had paid him millions of dollars for space in the office is that he owned
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," So this is all very unconventional and potentially even self dealing, right? But then there's the text of the AIPO, the legal document that they filed with the SEC"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," The word community is listed more than 100 and 50 times, and there was all of this kind of propping up what we now know is a very unprofitable business with this lingo of self help and creating community"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," And people just started to see it as selling air, you know, couching this unprofitable business in language that made people feel good  Eso this paperwork filed with the SEC really sets off an implosion unlike any other and start up history"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork, All the bad press and bad moves caused the company's expected valuation to drop from 47 billion down to just 15 billion  So come in as low as $10 billion
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Of course, Italian, the office sharing company, below $8 billion that is a fraction of the value of we work plummets  So this is when discussion starts to spread of well, should there even be a Ni Po"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Is this company ready to go public? And people start to turn on Adam pretty quickly  At this point, we work  CEO Adam Newman is facing new pressure from some of his top investors following the company's decision to postpone the I PS"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork, Some board members and large investors in the company are privately discussing whether they could replace CEO Adam Newman and how they would do it  They think he should be removed  He should not be the CEO of we work

The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," This house of cards was coming down this business based on being bags, distressed furniture and espresso machines, and yet somehow this guy has been treated to some guru genius because he's such an effective self promoter  PT Barnum is supposed to have said  There's a sucker born every minute"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," That's what's going on here and Wall Street  They were suckered, too, along with with Softbank buying in where they get this, $47 billion for $12 million in cash  So they decide that even getting rid of Adam does not save this effort to go public"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," And they have to pull the I Po  I mean, this is hugely embarrassing  This company that had been valued at $47 billion most valuable startup in the country is suddenly valued at a tiny fraction of that  And this Japanese investor, Masa San, who had been such a visionary"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," It's extremely embarrassing for him  Ultimately, he has to apologize to investors specifically for putting so much faith in Adam Newman  So what becomes of Adam Newman? At this point? He has been pushed out of his company"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," In a way, he has been exposed as someone who was a better salesman than operator of a company, and it becomes pretty clear that he has built something that is not all that revolutionary but is a little bit of a financial house of cards"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Well, here's what's so interesting about what happened to Adam Newman  He walked away from the company he founded with over a $1,000,000,000  How is that possible? Softbank bought his shares and we work, and they also agreed to pay him $46 million in consulting fees for four years"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Wow, Nice work, if you can get it  Why? Softbank would say that this was the cost to get Adam out and start to clean up the mess, which includes laying off potentially thousands of employees  You know, in this letter, the employees call it graft"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Here he was walking away with over a $1,000,000,000 in generational wealth as they face layoffs, losing their health care, getting nothing  They right? We're not the Adam Newman's of this world  We are a diverse workforce with rents to pay, households to support and Children to raise"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork, We are not asking for this level of graft  We're asking to be treated with humanity and dignity so we can continue living life while searching to make a living elsewhere
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," Amy, how do we explain what's happened here? The pre sad Psagot of we work in this situation that is ended with all these workers waiting to be laid off So the story of we work and Adam Newman is essentially a story of his exploitation of two phenomenon"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," The first is this kind of late stage tech capitalism, when investors really want to believe in these startup founders who have businesses that are essentially sort of traditional businesses with tech layered on uber is a perfect example of that calling a taxi with her phone and, in turn, give these companies enormous valuations when the business underpinnings are not necessarily there"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," So the irony, of course, was that Adam Newman tapped into this tech vernacular about changing the world about revolutionizing office space  But his company had really nothing to do with tech  It was a commercial real estate company, but people believe that"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," But it had a tech valuation because investors believed it  The second thing he quite brilliantly exploited was this yearning of millennials having this capitalist ambition and hustle, but also this yearning for community this we generation, as he called it, that it's not about you or me"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," It's about we, and in the end it essentially was about him  It is us will blaze a path forward, pave not with algorithms, not with software but with values, with friendship, with common goals and, most importantly, with humanity"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," And I think that's been particularly hard for we work employees to stomach  It's not just that the business turned out to be not as profitable as they thought it was, and their CEO walked away with the giant golden parachute"
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork, It was that they believed that it was bigger than that
The Spectacular Rise and Fall of WeWork," They believed it was a community, and now they're saying that it wasn't and the wee revolution is going to be led by the regeneration, and it will restoring each one of us a sense of dignity and community without which greatness cannot wait  Generation way  Thank you, Amy"
