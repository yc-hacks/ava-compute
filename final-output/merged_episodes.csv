The Queen of Cuba," We start by believing, and we stopped believing on Lee when our doubts and misgivings rise to the point where we could no longer explain them away  This proposition sounds at first that the kind of hair splitting that social scientists love to engage in it is not  It is a profound point that explains a lot of otherwise puzzling behavior  Consider, for example, what are the most famous findings in all of psychology, Stanley Milgram's obedience experiment  In 1961 Milgrom recruited volunteers from New Haven to take part in what he said was a memory experiment",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"On February 24, 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes operated by Brothers to the Rescue, an organization in Florida that tried to spot refugees fleeing Cuba in boats.

The Queen of Cuba," Each volunteer was met by a somber, imposing young men named John Williams, who explained that they were gonna play the role of teacher in the experiment, Williams introduced them to another volunteer, a pleasant middle aged man named Mr Wallace  Mr  Wallace, they were told, was to be the learner  He would sit in an adjoining room, wired to a complicated apparatus capable of delivering electrical shocks up to 450 volts  If you're curious about what 450 volts feels like, it's just shy of the amount of electrical shock that leaves tissue damage",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"On February 24, 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes operated by Brothers to the Rescue, an organization in Florida that tried to spot refugees fleeing Cuba in boats.

The Queen of Cuba," The teacher volunteer was instructed to give the lunar a series of memory tasks, and each time the learner failed, the volunteer was to punish him with an ever greater electroshock in order to see whether the threat of punishment affected someone's ability to perform memory tasks  As the shocks escalated, Willis would cry out in pain, and ultimately he started hammering on the walls  But if the teacher wavered, the imposing instructor would urge them on  Please continue  Theo Experiment requires that you continue  It is absolutely essential that you continue  You have no other choice",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"On February 24, 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes operated by Brothers to the Rescue, an organization in Florida that tried to spot refugees fleeing Cuba in boats.

The Queen of Cuba," You must go on  The reason the Milgram experiment is so famous is that virtually all of the volunteers complied  65% ended up administering the maximum dose to the hapless learner  In the wake of the Second World War and the revelations about what German guards have been ordered to do in the Nazi concentration camps, Milgram's findings caused a sensation  But to Levine, there's a second lesson to the experiment  Volunteers shows up and meets the imposing young John Williams",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"On February 24, 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes operated by Brothers to the Rescue, an organization in Florida that tried to spot refugees fleeing Cuba in boats.

The Queen of Cuba," He was actually a local high school biology teacher, chosen, in Milgram's words, because he was technical looking and dry, the type you would later see on television in connection with the space program, everything, Williams said June  The experiment had been memorized from a script written by Milgram himself  Mr  Wallace was, in fact, a man named Jim McDonough  He worked for the railroad modem, liked him for the part of victim because he was mild and submissive",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"On February 24, 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes operated by Brothers to the Rescue, an organization in Florida that tried to spot refugees fleeing Cuba in boats.

The Queen of Cuba," His cries of agony were taped and played over a loudspeaker wth e experiment was a little amateur theatrical production, and the word amateur here is crucial  The Milgram experiment was not produced for a Broadway stage  Mr Wallace, by Mo Gramm's own description, was a terrible actor, and everything about the experiment was, to put it mildly, more than a little far fetched  The electric shock machine didn't actually give shocks",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"On February 24, 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes operated by Brothers to the Rescue, an organization in Florida that tried to spot refugees fleeing Cuba in boats.

The Queen of Cuba," More than one participant saw the loudspeaker in the corner and wondered why Wallace his cries were coming from there, not from behind the door to the room where Wallace was strapped in  And if the purpose of the experiment was to measure learning, Why on earth did Williams spend the entire time with the teacher and not behind the door with the learner? Didn't make it obvious that what he really wanted to do was observed the person inflicting the pain, not the person receiving the pain  As hoaxes go, the Milgram experiment was pretty transparent",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"On February 24, 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes operated by Brothers to the Rescue, an organization in Florida that tried to spot refugees fleeing Cuba in boats.

Exactly  Not long after I spoke with Millie Avital, there was a hearing in front of three federal judges at a courthouse in San Francisco  It was about the treatment of migrant Children detained at the border  At issue was whether the conditions under which the Children were being held violated a previous legal commitment made by the government to provide safe and sanitary conditions in detention centers",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"You thought that there was only one kind of chutzpah.

Chutzpah vs. Chutzpah," The Department of Justice sent an attorney, Sarah Fabian, to make the case that the government was in compliance with the safe insanitary standard  Her principal argument was that the term safe insanitary didn't have an explicit definition, and that's any number of things might fall under those categories  That's Fabian, and this is one of the judges Marcia Birds on this  But sleep surely does right  You can't be safe and sanitary or safe as a human being if you can't sleep well  And you said in your briefs of justice, anything about sleeping",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"You thought that there was only one kind of chutzpah.

And Fabian answers? I think the concern there is your honor, the court finding that sleep, for example, falls under is relevant to a finding of no safe and sanitary conditions is one thing  But the ultimate conclusion is safe and sanitary is a singular category",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"You thought that there was only one kind of chutzpah.

Chutzpah vs. Chutzpah," In the agreement, you probably need to be a lawyer to understand what Fabian is saying and I'm not a lawyer, so I'm gonna have to guess  The government's argument goes like this  Sleep is one thing  Safe and sanitary are another  If the agreement had meant for sleep to fall under the requirement of safe and sanitary, it would have said so  Then Judge William Fletcher chimes in  Maybe sleep wasn't explicitly part of the safe and senator a definition, because it's too obvious  I mean, it may be that they don't get super thread count Egyptian linens",34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,"You thought that there was only one kind of chutzpah.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," Now, before we get onto the wildly implausible but just recap  What is metaphysics? Metaphysics is the part of philosophy that studies reality  So a lot of philosophy is looking at man's place in the world, wondering what the universe it's metaphysics is the bit that really wonders what the universe is  So this is distinct from science in the olden days, if you go back three centuries or more messy physics was not distinct from science  They were very much intertwined, doing the same kind of thing",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

One of the reasons I find them absolutely fascinating is that although the conclusion sound implausible? The arguments forthem can actually be really simple and compelling  Can you give an example? I can I can talk you through a couple  So let's start with a metaphysical view advanced by on Conway in the 16 seventies  Conway has a view that the whole universe, everything in it is alive  This view is known as vital ism, and I think that sounds implausible  First sight",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," Conway, back in the 17th century, is really worried about God's relationship with creation, as almost all European philosophers were back then  One question that Conway asks that almost no other philosopher asks is, How is it that God could create something different from himself?

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," I'm not thinking so by making everything in the world alive, she's eliminating that second interaction problem as well  God can create living things because we are like him  But that seems weird in another way because traditionally, God created the earth and created non living things as well as living things  So in standard Christian metaphysics, you'd assume that the release two kinds of things around in the world because God made them  For most Christians for era, the Bible would have been providing the premises from which you argue",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," It seems to me that the premises within the Bible actually lead to at least a dualism of stuff  Conway would say The Bible doesn't write anything about dualism  The Bible tells us that God creates the living things that move upon the earth on the mountains, on the stars  But the Bible says nothing about what they're made off, whether their material or physical  And so Conway thinks matter  Physics is fully compatible with these biblical stories",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," And what's more, she thinks that it's an improvement upon the traditional philosophies of her time because she gets to say that God, this grand living being would never create anything dead interesting  Now, presumably from some perspectives, this is an advance on the kind of Cartesian dualism that would have been pretty much prevalent in her day  So for those people who are materialists, it's sort of a step in the right direction because there's only one kind of stuff  Yeah, absolutely",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," So back in the 17th century, almost all everyone was a Cartesian duelist from the 16 forties onwards, and Conway thinks that Jewel is, um, is riddled with problems  Both of these interaction problems being some of them, and she can fix that  Her metaphysics is preferable to day cots, so in this case, she's got a wildly implausible conclusion  But what you're interested in is how she arrived in conclusion  Why, yes, absolutely  And I think that how she arrived at that conclusion on why I find the arguments there really simple and there will stay compelling",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," But that leads Addington to ask, What is the nature of reality? And his suggestion is, the only thing we really know about reality is that it contains conscious beings like us  So he looks inside his head  He finds a conscious being  He doesn't know what's outside his head  He's only got thes pointer readings, thes signs and symbols that he thinks maybe what's inside my head is a clue to what's outside  So maybe everything else that out there is conscious as well on this argument depends  Sikhism became really popular",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," Yeah, if you didn't have any data about what language people spoke in other places, that seems like a reasonable inference to make  It's not a knockdown argument in the sense that you might be wrong about  And maybe Eddington is wrong about this part of reality that he doesn't have access to  But it seems like a sensible suggestion, even if all the dials air coherently telling me a story that seems to imply that there are physical objects, not just mental objects",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Character is a very broad notion, and I want to make it clear that in my work I'm focusing specifically on moral character  I think of moral character as our moral fiber, how we are disposed to think, feel and act when it comes to moral matters  And it comes in two main varieties  There are moral virtues there, more vices",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Christian Miller believes that there is a character gap, a gap between what we think we are like morally and how we actually behave.

Christian Miller on the Character Gap," On the one hand, there are virtues like honesty, temperance and courage  And on the other hand, there are vices like dishonesty and cowardice  So what you're saying is that character is a pattern of behavior that somebody displays, so that if I'm a onliest person, if my character is fundamentally honest, I don't tend to tell lies  They tell the truth  That's part of it  That is a central part, but not all of it  So, on my way of thinking about character, it's both psychological and behavioral  So nice person does honest things in the world",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Christian Miller believes that there is a character gap, a gap between what we think we are like morally and how we actually behave.

Christian Miller on the Character Gap," We're not familiar to them, and that's often very illuminated of what they're lying motivations like now there's a long tradition in philosophy of focusing on character, particularly if you go back to Aristotle  This is at the heart of what it is to be moral or ethical  It is to have certain virtues, certain patterns of behavior, which are, to a certain extent, formed by our upbringing  Is that what you found in your examination of psychological research on character?

Perhaps the best way to start thinking about it is to think about the way in which possible worlds were introduced into philosophy, which having a really long time ago  So Gottfried Lightning, it's in the late 17th early 18th century, very famously said that we live in the best of all possible worlds",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," On Dhe, he said that in the context of worrying about the problem of evil, so the problem of how it could be that there's an omniscient, benevolent God who creates the world where there's all this pain and suffering and likenesses thought was like God had a choice when he created the universe, he could have set up the initial conditions differently  He could have set up the laws of nature differently because he had a choice and his benevolent  Clearly he does things for a reason  This must be the best of all possible worlds",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," Otherwise he would have selected one of those other possible worlds, and we'd be living in that one or not this one, unlike that sort of believed in possible worlds  I think so  He did think of them as ways the world could be where God sets up the initial conditions and the laws, and he has lots of choice about how he might do that on once you've set up the initial conditions and the laws and you just let everything run its course, you're going to get these really different ways in which things pan out  Right",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," So here we are in the actual world, we've got the universe, We've got Galaxies, we've got stars, We've got the earth, we've got human beings and so on, because if you said the initial conditions and the laws up differently, you're gonna get a whole different kettle of fish is not just Earth is his whole alternative universes  You're going to get alternative universes where nothing very much happens a tool you're gonna get ones where the Earth never comes into existence  You're gonna get ones where human beings never evolve, and so on and so on",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," So that's the basic idea  Another way you might think of it is kind of when you read a work of fiction, actually, especially science fiction, because their scope tends to be so much broader  You can think of what the author is doing, in a way is kind of telling you about a small corner of a possible world  So you think about the Sherlock Holmes stories",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," You might think of that as saying a little bit about some very constrained space show temple region of some possible world where there are all these people Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty and so on  And if you start with that and then think All right, so what would it be to tell a story about a whole possible worlds? You can kind of take the shuttle, comes stories and expand them back in time and forward in time and kind of across all of space  Fill out all of the details and then you've got a possible world",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," Go back to the example from Liben  Its voter famously marked that in Condi because it was fairly obvious to him that there must be some possible world in which people are much nicer to each other than they are in the real one  Yes, that is a worry for that particular response to the problem of evil  I mean, once you take the idea of possible worlds seriously, it's very hard to agree with lightning  It's really couldn't be a better possible world than this one  You take any bit of self ring and think, Really, Come on",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," Surely there's a possible world where that didn't happen, and surely that's a bit better than the actual world  So yet that's not a very convincing response to the problem of evil  I don't think so  Let's talk about the word possible  Just because we can imagine something doesn't mean it actually could happen, does it? That's a worry for talk about possible worlds  So the reason why philosophize nowadays really interested in possible worlds? Because they're really interested in making sense of what's known as modality",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," So claims about what's necessary, what's possible, what might have Bean, how things might have gone differently  Possibles obviously find everything puzzling, but they find modality particularly puzzling  We think off and they're not just philosophers is everyone  We make distinctions between things that happen but might not have done what I might have overslept this morning  I might have missed the bus  Those are things that didn't happen but could have done where some things we think couldn't have been different  So two plus two is four  It's very hard to see how that could have been different",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," We're very good at making those kinds of counter factual claims in general, in everyday life, we might argue about some of them, but we have quite a good grip on which one's a true which ones on and again, that's very puzzling  It's like what makes these claims true or false on what possible was give you is a way of understanding modality  So when I say that, it's just contingent Lee, true that I'm sitting here today, it could have been otherwise I might have been somewhere else",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," You can understand that impossible Worlds tour by saying, Well, OK, that's true at the actual world  But there are possible worlds where it's not true, right? There are possible worlds where I'm not sitting here  I'm doing something completely different right now  And similarly, when you say that something couldn't have been different when I say to 1st 2 is for that's unnecessary truth  We take that to mean two plus two is four is too in all possible worlds",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," So it's a way of understanding, all kind of reducing, that really puzzling motile tour talk about what might or might not have happened in tow  Some talk that ends up just being talked about possible world  So that's why it's a really useful thing for philosophers  But why is it useful to be able to describe it in those terms? I mean, why is it useful to be able to say that rather than if I had overslept, I wouldn't be here? There is a possible world in which I ever slept and didn't get here",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds, What's the use of that different way of talking? It's partly just a sort of bit of technical machinery  We have these UN analyzed notions of necessity and possibility and contingency are the ideas we get to analyze all of those in the same way  Just by using this very straight for device  There's a kind of deeper metaphysical reason why you might want to do that as well,c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," So the American philosopher David Lewis, I think, was partly interested in possible worlds for a kind of deeper metaphysical reason than some philosophers are, which was to do with being really puzzled by the nature of necessity  So David Hume, back a couple of centuries ago, I was really worried about the nature of necessity  He was worried about causation, and he didn't really see how it could make sense to say that one thing guaranteed that something else would happen  It would necessitate it",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," He found a really puzzling notion, and I think Louis shared some of that puzzlement about the nature, necessity, and what you get to do when you move from just talking about necessity to talking about possible worlds is as it were  You suck all of the necessity out of the world  You don't need to think that there's any necessity in the world because all Anisette city talk just gets cashed out in terms of all these other worlds, right? So you don't need to think of necessity is being a part of any world",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," You get necessity talk coming out of talking about present where the space of possible worlds  So that's the kind of metaphysical reason for once, take them seriously  Well, while we're on metaphysics and what exists, I think I'm right in saying that some philosophers don't just use this is a tool  They really believe that these other possible worlds actually exist in the same sense  Is one way now in yes, So David Lewis very famously did believe that",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," And he did say that typically the response he got to expressing that belief was we called the incredulous stare, and he was worried about whether the incredulous stare kind of counted as an argument  Like those distances have any weight in philosophical arguments about this, Lewis's view was, Look, they're an incredibly useful device, not just for understanding modality, but a whole range of other things  And his line was when something's that used for, you should just believe in it  He made the analogy with sets in mathematics is it sets a really strange thing, right?

Paul Sagar on Scepticism about Philosophy," Now this has got a long history  People have been skeptical about philosophy almost from the moment it started  Well, that's right  If we go right back to Plato's Republic, for example, we can see that one of the earliest challenges in the dialogue is from the figure off for Simic, a CE who brazenly tells Plato that all he's doing is engaging in word games on  It's just a load of nonsense that politics is power  There's nothing else to the world on that Socrates just needs to accept that he's on a hiding to nothing",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Throughout its history there have been challenges to the status of philosophy.

Paul Sagar on Scepticism about Philosophy," Unfortunately, the flip side is that there's no guarantee the immorality leads to unhappiness, and there's certainly no guarantee that morality leads the happiness that seems to be a rough correlation between living a decent ethical life and being a relatively happy person  And Aristotle was one of the people who made this very clear  External luck can take all that away from you very, very quickly",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Throughout its history there have been challenges to the status of philosophy.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," Many theorists, sociologists like Edward Shills would point instead to civility is the virtue of modern civil society or bourgeois society  Civility is the manners of the marketplace, where we sort of bump up against each other, and we live together and share a life  But often it's a kind of rough and tumble and conflict Shewell exchange kind of life theorist of civility, in that sense, very often want to point to the 18th and 19th centuries as the crucial time where a modern concept of civility developed",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," But I, in my own work would want to argue that actually civility in the modern sense in the sense we touched on at the beginning as a conversational virtue pertinent to disagreement in particular dates slightly earlier  And it's a product of early modern debates about religious toleration that emerged precisely in that time, where the boundary between inside and outside the Civitas is more porous and is itself a subject of conflict  So who are the sources of this religious civility? The story, I tell, actually starts from the opposite side",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," It starts from trying to offer an account of who the inventors of modern incivility really were  So here  I think the most crucial figure is really Martin Luther himself  I mean, you might think of Martin Luther is kicking off the first modern crisis of civility 500 years ago because, in addition to making sophisticated theological arguments against the Catholic Church, he also decided to frame those arguments and to present them in such a way that was deliberately offensive to the social mores of his day",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," So for Luther, the idea that evangelism and the kind of calling out of corruption had to be done in an uncivil way was part and parcel of this idea of Protestantism as a kind of protest against the status quo  So you suggesting that Protestantism is actually the source of the kind of some would say, honest in your face telling it, How is debate that others would see is rude, impertinent and offensive speech? I think that's exactly right",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other. How important is it in political life?

Teresa Bejan on Civility," There's a risk of exaggerating here, but I think it is fair to say that you can look to the origins not only of modern ideas of free speech  Fundamentalism is a kind of in your face proselytism, but also the origins of something like modern call out culture  The idea that what we need to do is call out others, cry out against injustice wherever you see it and not care about their hurt feelings  I confess to being in the liberal compare",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," I can see the virtues of being prepared to state what you believe in a way that you're comfortable with not being over concerned when something important is at stake with somebody else's sensibilities  I mean, you don't want to go out and offend people, but if they happen to be particularly sensitive about the issue, then going out of your way not to offend them could result in a misunderstanding about not getting the truth out about a situation not expressing your own views and may be compromising to a degree which is not satisfactory",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," What is the argument for this sort of civil interaction, as opposed to the robust disagreement that is characteristic of the liberal tradition? I think that's an excellent question  And it lies at the root of what I would describe as a strong tradition of civility, skepticism, the idea that the virtue of civility isn't really a virtue at all",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," It's a way of trying to silence the speech of others, a way of trying to suppress ideas that you don't like, or maybe even exclude or marginalize those with whom you disagree or whom you don't really see his members of a kind of civil or even civilized quality  That was the Lutheran position that civility in an unjust society isn't a virtue at all",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," Not only do we have a duty to tell the truth and not to censor ourselves out of respect for someone else's feelings, it's actually even a duty to offend their sensibilities because those privileged by an unjust status quo will always be offended when they're presented with the truth  So you're making a very good case for instability of the moment  What's the other side of us? Well, the other side takes that critical point really seriously",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," It observes this dynamic of suppression and exclusion that seems always to be at work when we're talking about civility and more importantly, when we're accusing other people of being uncivil",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," But then it also says that nevertheless, if civility is a kind of claim to regulating or governing our disagreements on the basis of something shared, then what really matters is what exactly it is we're claiming that we need to share in order to have a civil disagreement, because you might think that any kind of claim that we have to have something in common in order to be able to disagree is itself  You know, it already opens the door to a kind of unjust suppression or exclusion",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," But then you might also think what? Actually, no, we do need to share something, but it's really an important question of what perhaps you could give an example to make this clearer  So the proponent of civility can come back to the critic and say yes  The fears about suppression and exclusion are well founded but say to that, rejecting civility altogether under reacts to the challenges  That disagreements, particularly disagreements about questions that we think of as being somehow fundamental",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," So when we're talking about civility, we're really talking about what are the qualities of a conversationalist that make those really difficult disagreements possible? So is this just a pragmatic issue that you're saying what's would make a conversation between two people disagree? Go well, well, probably it's not if one offends the other, so it's much better that they go out of the way  Notes  We found each other and play by the rules of civility and thereby have a conversation that is an intuitive thought, and yet it very quickly leads to problems",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," So if we want to define civility or the standard civility with reference to the other person's feelings at all very quickly, the very sensitive person would seem to have a kind of Vito or a kind of lock on defining what a civil disagreement is  This was something that occurred historically, too, instead of in this moment after the Protestant Reformation, when people became very worried about the uncivil evangelism of Protestants like Luther  There waas a lot of talk about the offensiveness of their speech and very quickly",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," The move was also to talk about the offensiveness of the speech of other disliked dissenters  So, you know, you have these wonderful handbooks of civil conversation in the 17th century talking about how atheists need to be more sensitive to how offensive there discourses, too  They're good Christian neighbours  I'm really interested to know how we could adapt this evolving concept of civility and bring it into contemporary debates because you're an advocate of civility",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," But so far you haven't really put the best case for it, right? I think what really sets me apart is a theorist of civility  In a proponent of civility today is that I really started out as a civility skeptic and a critic of civility, because I was very sensitive to the ways that calls for more civility  And accusations of incivility against one's political opponents could be used as a way to suppress, exclude and silence",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," But it's also clear that the critics of civility are generally speaking, assuming that they're interlocutors are going to nevertheless abide by certain rules of conversational behavior that they won't interrupt that they won't just hurl insults in responding, right? So the question becomes, Well, maybe civility isn't a matter of not saying offensive things, not a matter of policing our speech, are choosing our words really carefully  Maybe civility is something else  Maybe civility is the virtue in the qualities of the speaker and listener that allow us to have those difficult conversations in the first place",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," And so that's where I started and trying to theorize civility, really thinking about civility as the willingness to stay in the room and continue to engage with even the most deplorable of one's political opponents with the thought that disagreement itself is necessarily disagreeable  And nevertheless, it's better that we disagree that we fight our battles with words  Then we fight those battles with swords  But I can disagree forcefully with you, maybe offend you in the process without fighting you  There is a distinction still between words and blows",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," It's a distinction that I think increasingly is being put under pressure  If we think about Austin Ian, accounts of language and a lot of contemporary theories of hate speech and sexist speech would say, Well, no words are actions, Words do wound and words do this essential work of creating and maintaining social hierarchies and status differentials",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," So what really interested me in looking to the 16th and 17th centuries for a theory of what I would call mere civility as this kind of minimal, conversational virtue that makes difficult disagreements possible is that in that period, no one ever would have made the case that oh well, disagreement is okay because words don't really matter Anyway  There's a strong sense of the importance of language and the importance of the word  So the word of God, the gospel as something that must flow freely in society  So the question really becomes",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," How do you have difficult disagreements in a tolerant society without that society falling apart and collapsing into civil war? You introduced this notion of mere civility  Could you just freshen that out a little bit? Tell us what it means So mere civility I would define as a minimal conformity to social norms of respectful behavior, and specifically, it's the minimum necessary to keep the conversation going  But you can tell right there from that definition that the particular demands of civility or mere civility in any given conversation be highly context dependent and highly audience dependent",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," So instead of fixating or focusing on rules of civil conduct, the appropriate way to doff your hat where the appropriate ceremonial language or the way that we address or, you know, express deference to others instead we sort of think about civility as a prudential or practical judgment about what's required in a given conversation with a given conversationalist so that conversation can continue",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," But then it has this other element, which is that it remains committed also to telling the truth to our interlocutors, and part of that truth will often be telling them what we really think of them  And they're execrable views  So we're civility  One way of thinking about it is a commitment both not pulling our punches, but also to not landing them all at once so that the conversation can continue between combatants",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," I can see that Prudential Ia's you say this could be a great virtue to cultivate But I would suggest it's not a widely distributed virtue at the moment  And many people seem psychologically incapable off doing what you're suggesting when it comes to discussing matters that are really important to them, right?

Teresa Bejan on Civility," The thought that in the face of gross injustice, civility isn't a virtue it all  It's just a demand for deference from the powerful to an unjust status quo  What worries me then, as a proponent of civility is the propensity of some people who call for civility to try to turn it into this kind of aspirational elite and sort of gentlemanly virtue that says, Oh, do but be civil right  Let's have a civil conversation",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

My post conversion experience has been that I've become really sensitive to the ways in which incivility and uncivil disagreement lead to a really pernicious process of people retreating into the more agreeable company off the like minded, right? So one thing I always like to point out to my students is that there's a reason that disagreeable is a synonym for unpleasant  It's much nicer to talk to people who we can be confident, agree with us already  But that's a disaster in a tolerant society  It's a disaster in a democracy",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.
