But with almost all of the country’s raisins coming from a small area in California’s Central Valley, it is a brutal and cutthroat industry.</p><p>In the early 20th century a few wealthy raisin growers decided to form a collective called Sun-Maid. After the government mandated that 85% of growers join the collective, Sun-Maid executives used violence and intimidation to get farmers to join. The farmers who held out had little bargaining power and were forced to accept lower prices. But in the 1960s, the independent farmers banded together to fight back. They founded the Raisin Bargaining Association to negotiate higher prices, setting off a power struggle that would last for decades.</p><p>Support us by supporting our sponsors!</p><p><strong>Quartz </strong>- Just go to <a href=""http://QZ.com"" target=""_blank"">QZ.com</a> for 50% off membership and enter code <strong>BW</strong>. </p><p>And our friends at LinkedIn are back with a new season of <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hello-monday-with-jessi-hempel/id1453893304"" target=""_blank"">Hello Monday with Jessi Hempel</a>.

S. A note to listeners. This episode contains adult content. It's June 1923. Selma, California The raisin Capital of the world, Rusty Eskandarian walks through his vineyards in the verdant San Joaquin Valley. The sun has just dipped below the horizon, and it's getting dark. Walking through the rows of grapes, he feels peaceful. It's a far cry from the boisterous dinner table that awaits him at home. Rusty is 30 years old, a small, unintimidating man with a boyish face. But when provoked, a steely resolve takes hold in. An inner fierceness rises up. Rusty likes handling the smooth green Berries still warm from the sun. They remind him of his home back in Armenia. He and his parents fled years ago in 1912 getting out just before the genocide that killed his entire extended family. Once in the United States. They moved to California, where they worked his field hands while they saved enough money to buy their own vineyard. It took years walking. The rose still fills rusty with pride. Suddenly, a box truck turns into his row and skids to a stop, sending up a cloud of dust. Adrenaline floods Rusty's body. He searches for one of the wooden stakes. They used to train the great bind to defend himself. But the headlights blind him. Rusty hears several men come out of the truck, but he can't tell how many. His hand flails for the steak. He grasps it, but before he can pull it out of the ground, he's punched hard across the jaw. Rusty falls to the ground. Dirt gets in his mouth. In his eyes, he tastes blood. Rusty struggles to stand up, but he's kicked hard in the ribs, knocking him back down. He's overpowered and outnumbered. His Attackers, tie his wrists, yank him to his feet and throw him in the back of the truck. Inside, Rusty sees he's not alone. There are seven other men, all bloody, with their hands tied behind their backs. They own farms nearby. He knows they all have one thing in common. They've refused to sell their crops to Sun Maid Raisin Corporation, and it seems son made will stop at nothing to change their minds. Business wars is brought to you by the capital one.

WalMart Rewards Card What's in your wallet? Terms and exclusions apply from wondering. I'm David Brown and this is Business wars. Raisins. It's hard to think of a more innocent and dissed food, the morsel that looks like a chocolate chip in trail mix but sadly, isn't the little red boxes kids abandoned in their lunchboxes or toss out of Halloween bags. Almost all of the raisins produced in the United States come from just 200,000 acres in California's San Joaquin Valley, with low profit margins and high labor costs. It's a cutthroat, insular world that pits the gargantuan son made raising corporation against small growers for a bigger share of a $500 million business. In our new three part series, we look at one of the longest running business wars in the United States. It's a tale as sordid as any gangster story, with violence barely legal business practices and betrayal. This is Episode one, a desperate brotherhood. It's 1918 in Fresno, California Wiley Given adjusts his jacket over his recruiting stomach. At 46 years old, he's starting to put on extra pounds, but he carries it with a confidence as he struts through his brand new processing plant. It's Sunday, so the place is empty. Tomorrow is the grand opening, but in his head he can already hear the chatter of workers. As they soared and package tons of raisins, he grins to himself. It's a whole new day for raisins, and it's all thanks to him. Six years ago, the raisin industry was in the dumps. Raisins were a relatively new commodity in the United States, and consumers weren't taking to them as fast as farmers expected. Prices were dropping so low that farmers couldn't cover their production costs. Farmers started talking about forming a raisin growers collective. Other agricultural sectors, like Citrus, were hugely successful when they did this. It allows farmers to pool their resources and negotiate higher prices than individual farmers could on their own. But all the efforts to organize raisin farmers fell apart. Raisin growers were a disparate and stubbornly individualistic group, but wily, given an uneducated boy from Pennsylvania and the son of a preacher, I found a way first instead of organizing the California associated raising company or carcass, he called it is a nonprofit organization, as most grower collectives were. He made it a corporation. This allowed bankers, lawyers and others in Fresno's upper class to buy stock in a corporation giving the collective and influx of cash. With the money in hand. Given told growers that if 75% of the farmers joined the cooperative, he'd use the money to market raisins. Farmers signed up. Giffen made good on his promise. He hired the best ad man he could find, and he came up with the perfect slogan for the raisins that car produces. Son made. Griffin loves the play on words the raisins air literally made by the sun right, but it's spelled M A I D, both for the beautiful Girl on the box and to strengthen the trademark. He kind of wishes that was the name of the collective. It's better than card. Maybe he'll change it in the future. That's a problem for another day. Right now. Given is putting his money where his mouth is. He spends $400,000 a year on marketing. Kark send sales reps to grocery stores to talk aboutthe wonders of Sun Maid raisins, and it's paying off. Raisins, once seen as a luxury, are now on shopping lists of every housewife. Sales are up and farmers air getting double for their crops. What they did before the collective gift and moved on to stage two of his grand Plan A processing factory. And it's in operation now. The door opens, and a balding man holding a notebook walks in. Mr. Geffen, I'm with the Fresno Bee. We have an interview schedule. Do you remember? Yes, Yes. Please come in. The newspaper reporter looks around the space. He runs his hand along the sorting table where the raisins are prepared and then box for shipment. This is a very impressive facility. Giffen can't help noticing that the reporter doesn't actually seem too impressed. So tell me what made you decide to open this factory well, it was the logical next step. We have 9200 growers with us. You know, it's the largest percentage of growers in a collective of any agricultural sector in the state, right? I do know that again, given clocks a skeptical look on the reporters face, he thought this was going to be a glowing story about the new factory. After all, it's bringing hundreds of jobs to the area. He's starting to wonder if the reporter has another agenda, but given carries on well, the best way to move forward so we could make a profit was to cut out the middlemen and start packing ourselves. It's complete vertical integration. It may be cold blooded, and I feel for the packing houses they are losing a good deal of business. 75% of their business, I hear right, but it's my job to raise profits for growers, and this was a way to do it. I heard one wholesaler described Kark is the most airtight monopoly he'd ever met. Giffen laughs. Now he knows what this reporter's problem is. He's one of these men who skeptical of monopolies but given thinks America's obsession with that is misguided. He believes the power of individual is, um, is a myth. The best way to get ahead is to unite and take total control. They may call us a monopoly or trust, but we're a benevolent one. He believes that growers who don't join the collective or ruining it for everyone else, and the best way to make money for everyone is to have complete control of all aspects of growing and selling raisins. The more monopolistic the better. But the U. S government doesn't see it that way. It's 1923 and Russki Eskandarian walks with his wife and three boys to the annual raising festival in the town center. It's a big to do. There's live music, dancing competitions. One of his sons walks ahead of violin case in his hand. Hurry up, Dad, I told Petey I'd meet him at the stage of three o'clock so we could tune up together. And Petey is never in tune, but his rusty comes to courthouse Park. He slows down. He sees thousands of farmers gathered grim looks on their faces. You go ahead, son. I'm going to stay here and listen to what Mr Merritt has to say, Isn't he the new head of Sun made? Yep, I thought we hated Son made Rusty and his wife both hush him and look around nervously. It's not safe to say that in public there are rumors that night writers, gangs of sun made affiliates or targeting independent growers coercing them to join Rusty quietly tells his son, even if we were independent, what happens to son made affects us all. Okay, it's important that we know what's going on. He splits off from his family and joins the other farmers in the park. It's packed. Rusty estimates that there must be a few 1000 people here. After a moment, a thin, severe looking man steps up to the podium. It's Ralph P. Merit, the new head of Sun made. The crowd watches him dubiously. He has a finance background, and he's worked in cattle and rice. But he's never worked with raisins. The crowd grows silent as you know we are in a time of crisis. The old son made corporation was found to be in violation of the United States antitrust laws. Rusty shifts uncomfortably and stays quiet. Merit continues. Fortunately, Congress stepped in and passed a law that allows grower collectives to set prices, but they have new rules that we need to follow. The most important one is that we need 85% of you to sign up in order to be considered a collective way. Have one month to reach this goal. Can we do it? If Sun made failed, this entire region failed. Don't let that happen. The crowd begins to disperse. Rusty heads out to meet his family at the festival. As he's leaving, a son made employee approaches him waving a contract. Can I get you to sign this rusty tenses? As survivors of the Armenian genocide, Rusty's parents instilled a strong sense of independence in him, they told him. Don't depend on anyone else but Rusty's objections to Sun Maid or more than philosophical. It's about economics before it distributes profits to farmers, the collective extracts fees for marketing and the cost of damages. If smaller growers failed to deliver the harvest, they promised, and that could be ruinous for a small farm like Rusty's. He'd rather take his chances negotiating with the few independent packers that air left. I'm going to hold off as Rusty walks away, he can feel the man's eyes narrowing boring into him. He tries not to show his fear, but he knows there's now a target on his back. But a few weeks later, Rusty finds himself tied up in the back of a truck with other son made old house. After what feels like an hour truck finally stops. Door opens. Son made men grab the farmers, roughly throwing them out of the truck. Let's go up against that tree Now he kicks the man next to Rusty to emphasize his point. Farmers are tied to a fig tree. Rusty stares at the men, pushing them around. Their blond hair and blue eyes are in stark contrast with the ethnic features of the farmers they've tied up. Scandinavians and Armenians have both been in the valley since the late 18 hundreds, growing raisins but where the Scandinavians were welcomed by the upper crust with open arms. The Armenians. We're not one of the sun made men, cracks a whip with one hand. He holds up a contract in his other. All you have to do is sign your raisins over the sun made, and all this will be over. None of the farmers move the man with the whip size. I guess we're doing this the hard way, huh? Whipping begins. Rusty looks the man right in the eye as the whip slashes Rusty's legs and torso. He won't give him the satisfaction of wincing. One by one, the farmers around him give in. They signed the contracts. When they get too rusty. He two signs. But he has a trick up his sleeve. He makes sure to get a cz much of his blood as he can on the paper. What is this? We can't turn in a bloody contract. Let it go. We have enough signatures for tonight. Rusty manages a small grand. He may be bloody and beaten, but he is still an independent farmer. Rusty survives the night and he never signs with son made. He ekes out a living as an independent raisin farmer until his death in 1962. For 40 years, son maids power will be unmatched in the 19 sixties. One unlikely farmer will dig in his heels and he'll challenge son maids. Hold and shake up raisin industry. Hey, I want to talk with you for just a moment about our sponsor quartz.

It's 1966 and earning Bedrosian and his brothers, Kenneth and Creek, or are sitting in the office of a son made executive. Ernie is a charismatic man who started attending raisin board meetings when he was in college at Fresno State. He has a deep passion for the raise in business, but today he hates it. They've been here for hours, trying to negotiate a price for this year's crop. Their farm is independent, but Son Made has started buying additional raisins from independent farmers to boost output. It they're packing house. Bernie tries again to get the price he needs at $240. Burton. We won't break even. We need 250 the exact shrugs it's take it or leave it time. If you don't want this deal. I have growers waiting to meet with me. Who will the brothers exchange? A look? $240 per ton will mean their margins, air tight. But it's just one small farm. They don't have a lot of leverage is the biggest buyers Son made effectively sets the price reluctantly, the brothers agree. On the drive back to the farm, they're demoralized. Every year, the negotiations get more difficult. They never know what price they're going to get her, even when they'll get paid, it all feels out of their control in the back seat. Ernie stews. We wouldn't be in this position if we had a raise in bargaining association. All of us independent growers could unite and set a price son made couldn't undercut us in the front. Bernie's Brothers exchange a look. This is not the first time Ernie's raise this point. He's been talking about it since college. Kenneth Size. Are you gonna tell us about the tomato growers again? Their prices rose 200% after they formed a bargaining association. Why can't we do that? Because you couldn't get a group of raisin farmers to agree on where to have dinner. You're never going to get enough of them to join a bargaining association, not enough for you to have any power anyway. Krekar agrees. The raisin farmers who were still independent now want to stay independent. They stood up to the Knight Rider thugs. They're just not joiners. Bernie looks out the window. They're passing another packing plant. Outside. He sees men he knows from a nearby farm. They're picketing, demanding a higher rate from the packing plant. I don't know. I think things are different now. I think it's time. With permission from his brother's, Ernie takes the next year off from the farm and spends it organizing what will become known as the Raisin Bargaining Association or R B A. It's slow going, but Ernie is able to use his natural charisma, Armenian heritage and deep knowledge of the business to convince people to sign on. He's tireless. He sets a target of how many tons of raisins he needs toe have leverage. He organizes district meetings. He makes personal contact with growers. He works with the state government to establish him as an official association, and he makes progress. Finally, in February 1967 he drives up to one of the last farms, adrenalin pumps through his veins. This farmer was one of the last holdouts, but Ernie was able to earn his trust. He's indicated he's ready to sign. Ernie just hopes he hasn't changed his mind in the half hour. It's taken him to drive over here. Ernie takes a deep breath and knocks on the door. A tall, dark haired man opens the door high, earning high. So you ready to do this? Yeah, I guess I still feel like my dad is gonna roll over in his grave. And, well, times change. I know our people like to stay independent, but what's the point of independence if we can't make a living? The man nods. You're right. Bernie presents a contract in a pen. The man signs his name. Mark Eskandarian. He's Rusty's son. Ernie grins wide. He's done it with Marc's signature. He has nearly 2000 farmers signed up. The R B A represents farmers growing more than 150,000 tons of raisins. Finally, Ernie has the leverage he needs to negotiate with Sun made, and that fall it's time to see what kind of money he can get for his newly unified growers. Bernie lets out a satisfied sigh as he puts his water glass on the table. He leans back in his seat. He's meeting with the sun made execs again, but this time, but it feels entirely different. He has power now. Good news. Boys were willing to improve our price from last year to $242 per time. Nope. I'm sorry. The R B A has set the price of $307 per ton. We just can't go below that. And when I say we to be clear, I mean 80% of the independent growers in the area. You understand the executive puffs out his chest. Well, perhaps we need to continue these conversations with the growers who are not in the R B. A Ernie sees through his bluff. Assure you could do that if all you need is 12,000 tons of raisins, because that's all they have. The executive grows pale. He has no option but to accept the R B. A's price in 1967 its first year in existence, the R B A gets a 28% price increase for its members. But more importantly, it gets a win against son made something that was unthinkable for years and that threatens son maids control over the market for now. But Son Made still has some tricks up its sleeve. On the next episode, California Raisins face a new competitors from overseas. The R B A overplays its and and Sun Maid fights to reestablish its dominance from wondering. This is Business Wars way.

In our last episode, we heard about how Mars is pushed into the international market, turned a profit in China, which in turn drove the company to expand to other emerging markets across the globe. And while that ambition certainly worked out for Mars on the business side, one major issue that's now facing the company and the world, for that matter carries some pretty dire consequences. We're talking about deforestation, the environmental impact of producing chocolate. Certainly on the scale of a company like Mars, it's actually astounding. The Washington Post reports that in 2017 40 football fields of tropical forests were lost every single minute. All this, spurred by the demand for cocoa and other goods like soybeans and palm oil, and one trouble spot for chocolate producers, in particular is West Africa, where deforestation is being driven by hundreds of thousands of poor cocoa farmers. For its part, Mars has vowed to switch entirely too sustainable, Coco by 2020. But check that calendar. They've now decided to move the target date to 2025. Our guest today is Steven Mufson. He's a reporter for The Washington Post, and he covers the business of climate change. He recently wrote a wide ranging article on the Environmental Impact of chocolate, and he's gonna be joining us to talk about why producing environmentally sustainable chocolate is so hard that's coming up.

Glad to be here for a sense of scale when we're talking about something like I mean deforestation, and for those of us who have never you know seen like a cocoa tree. What does it look like? How bigotry are we talking about here? Well, the trees aren't very much larger than than a person. Stands quite different from the older trees that have been taking down to make room for cocoa plantations. Those older ones can be, you know, scores of feet tall. So let's do a translation here. One tree equals what in terms of chocolate. Well, it isn't so much the tree a cz The number of beans had 400 beans it takes to produce Ah, pound of chocolate. Wow, that that seems like quite a lot of beans. It it is a lot of beings, especially when they're they're being taken out of these big pods by hand. And, uh, seem we have some great photographs of that with, um he's kind of milky, milky white beans being taken out of the pots and put out to dry. Well, your reporting specifically centers around deforestation for cocoa, and I think it probably be safe to say that most of our listeners don't know where this is happening. Could you put us on a map somewhere? About 2/3 of the of the world's cocoa comes from just two countries in West Africa ones the Ivory Coast and one's Ghana. Um, and they have a long history of producing cocoa there, and they are the dominant players in the market. Why Ghana and the Ivory Coast? Why these two places? Is it just the climate? Is it just the existing tree growth? What? Why these two places? Well, that's a great question. I think a lot of it dates back to the colonial era, Uh, when Coco was taken from their not so much the United States, but Maur to Britain and to France. And I do think there are other parts of the world that you can grow cocoa, especially places like Peru, and it's possible that we may see more cocoa from those places over time. But I think there's ah long tradition of doing it in this area. Well, given that they're the dominant players in the market and I would imagine ah rather crucial for the incomes, the livelihoods of a lot of people in those places. Um, absolutely. What? Why? Why is why is deforestation the only answer? Couldn't you manage these these cocoa trees in such a way that, like, say, you could plant one parcel and and harvest another, and you have a sort of ah ah, cycle going Well, here's what makes this such a tough nut to crack, so to speak. Um, you're dealing with a commodity that is hard to differentiate from one place to another. All cocoa is basically the same, whether it's from Ivory Coast or or someplace in South America and in the in West Africa. It's produced by hundreds of thousands of small farmers. But maybe one and 1/2 1,000,000 people in Ivory Coast, maybe another half 1,000,000 Ghana. So keeping an eye on what those people are doing all the time is very, very difficult. And that's what's made deforestation in this area so, so tough to stop, huh? Now, in terms of the cocoa farmers themselves, how much do they tend to earn? I mean, is this is this something that someone can ah, family can can live off the land just growing, Coco, They can, but they're not. They're not gonna make a whole lot of money. Most of them are at who are slightly below or slightly above the poverty line for for Ah, these kinds of areas. And of course, I guess some years you're gonna get have a better harvest and other years it's gonna be tough. The usual vicissitudes of of of agriculture, I guess, right? Absolutely. I mean, the price of cocoa has been coming down in recent years. And even though some companies have been paying premiums to get cocoa that has been certified as not having come from deforested areas, the money of the extra money from that isn't enough to offset the decline in cocoa prices in recent years. Help me with something. Why is it the trees need to be taken down for new cocoa trees to do? These trees sort of ceased to be productive after a certain number of cycles. Well, you're They plant the cocoa trees either underneath some of the big trees. But more likely they'd just cutting all the big trees down to make room for the cocoa trees that tends to work out well in the for the farmer and at least in the early years. But in the later years, this could be a problem because the heat is just too great. Nice, And I was speaking with someone today. Actually, he was saying that at this rate, not only will there be decimation of the old forests, but that in 20 or 30 years will become increasingly difficult to grow cocoa in these areas. So is it because there just isn't the shade that's necessary for these cocoa trees, because you're having to consume as much of the land as possible to maximize output. Right? And you want you want son in the early years, but you might want a little more shade in the out years. I see. So it's not that new trees air better necessarily. It's just that the land is being taken away for more cocoa trees. Well, the old trees weren't cocoa trees. The old trees were these extremely tall, old growth trees that play a particularly important role in storing carbon dioxide there, taking it in through photosynthesis, and then they're storing it in in their own ah, in their own in the wood that they that they that they have, and that's what makes this so important. So when these old growth trees come down, what happens then? Well, when the old growth trees come down, you have a kind of a 22 blows to blows at the FT climate problem. One is that the big trees are no longer absorbing carbon dioxide from the air and processing it through photosynthesis. But in addition, the the carbon that had been stored in the trees is released as these trees with their or rot or taken away to be pulped er to do something else with them. So it's really cutting those trees down. Strikes two blows against the climate change problem. You've traced sort of the flows of of the money here, and, you know, let's if we can. Maybe we should begin with small scale farmers who who plant and harvest what is the road from there to the candy store shelf So the small scale farmers sell their product to middlemen. The first lady actually are several layers of middlemen. The first layer, known in French Ivory Coast, is a French speaking country piece, though, and those in turn take it to a larger trading. Companies eventually get to the big Cargill's of the world, and they, in turn, sell it to some of the big chocolate companies like Mars and, uh, Nestle and Hershey is Coco commoditized in the same way that, say, pork bellies or something like that might be, Yeah, there's a standard, uh, you know, ah, standard commodity. And they're and they're indistinguishable. That's what makes them so easy to trade on big international markets like corn or sugar, gold, copper, all these air commodities that are traded internationally. And Coco is very much like that. But you're saying that recently the prices for Coco have been falling, which obviously effects those farmers, too. Why is that? Why is it that cocoa prices seem to be falling? Well, I think they're They're different things that can that can drive prices up or down. It could be weather. But in this case, when when the price is dropping, it's probably because of small farmers have been ramping up growth in order to, uh, stay out of poverty or to take advantage of the growing demand for cocoa across the globe. So what you're saying is that the supply side of the supply demand equation is actually Coco Glut is it were, and we have a mild coco blood. But yes, that's exactly what's happening, because demand demand has been going up steadily. People love to have their Candies and their hot chocolates and, well, let's let's pursue that just a little bit more because this is something that I find rather fascinating that yes, it is. The sweet tooth has never gone away. But increasingly certainly in the developed world where many of these markets exist for that finished product the candy, the chocolate Ah, is there's been a kind of ah ah, slow turn away from sweets. In fact, if anything, it seems like certainly in Europe, in the United States and elsewhere, I see ah, sort of a shift toward, um, more wholesome and healthful eating. If, if anything, why do you think that the demand is is increasing? Well, I'm not sure it's unique to Coco. I think we've We're witnessing a very interesting shift in in health food eating mean. At first it was very much about you and your health. But now I think people are reconsidering some of the things that they eat like beef and cocoa. For climate reasons, it takes more carbon dioxide to produce beef, Then it does to produce vegetables. And in the case of cocoa, the impact of the widespread deforestation is so great that that's also I think, made some people wonder. I don't think it's had a big impact, but I think it has a lot of people thinking Well, now, while you were out reporting this story, was there anything that struck you most, perhaps, about deforestation in West Africa. Anything that sort of sticks in your mind? Well, the the incredible thing about deforestation is that the pace of destruction is truly alarming. There are in 2017. There were 40 football fields across the planet, not just in West Africa, that were lost every minute. And Ivory Coast and Ghana have lost not only the big trees that have been in sort of open areas, but they losing trees in protected national forests that are particularly valuable.

Plus, I want to look back to the Mars company, which has been a big part of the focus of the Siri's that we've just concluded your business wars. You have reported that that company has invested a lot into becoming more environmentally conscious. Like what? Well, they've invested in a lot of renewable energy. They have purchased or built enough solar and wind power to offset the consumption of their operations and at least half a dozen different countries. They they have advocated for a carbon tax in Congress, something that's a very tough measure t Thio to get support for. They've also counted their total greenhouse gas emissions in a very telling way. And unlike a lot of other companies out there, they've counted not only themselves and their own factories and their immediate suppliers, But they've counted people and companies all the way down the supply chain all the way down to these small farmers in West Africa. So they're they're pretty pretty open about that sort of thing. Um, the question, of course, is what do you do with all that? Uh, and I think like a lot of companies, they sent some targets a decade ago that they've been unable to fulfill. And during this whole time, deforestation is continuing at a rapid pace. I think they're reconsidering various things now, but at the moment it looks like those 10 years have been additional lost years. Um, notwithstanding setting these high goals, how does what Mars has done or at least tried to do? How does that fit in with what's happening industrywide? Are there other companies that have taken similar steps, or does Mars sort of stand apart? Somehow? I think Mars doesn't stand apart that much. Except, you know, maybe on the side of of trying to doom or and they've and they speaking to the executives there, they think they honestly assess just what a failure some of these efforts have been. But, um, there are plenty of other companies in the city in the same boat there. Some kind of a large number of them have drawn up plans for the for the future, which involves some combination of satellite information and more people on the ground. But there are some companies that haven't even done that. So I would say Mars is typical, or or maybe even on the good side of typical. And yet you also have reported that Mars still has ah, huge carbon footprint because of agriculture. Um, is there any way of sort of quantifying or or maybe making it possible for us to visualize how that how big that footprint is and how closely that might be tied to the deforestation we've been talking about. Well, the total emissions of Mars is about equal to the country of Panama. So, um, pretty, which seems large to me that that a single company would have this many admissions as a as, ah, a single country. But I supposed to be fair, a CZ were talking before. Mars isn't the only chocolate company that contributes to this. And I'm wondering if, if Mars is has the footprint of a country the size of Panama Um, what about the chocolate industry? What? What is the whole exactly, exactly? So that's a great question. How would is there any way of getting your head around that, or is that just too big of, Ah oven issue? Well, I haven't thought about this, but I believe that Mars is It's a private company, so it's hard to say just how big it is, But I think I think it's somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 of the whole chocolate business. And and so it probably means that the whole chocolate business might be worth 234 Panama's I understand what you're saying and in in terms specifically when it comes to to combating deforestation. Ah, for all of the issues that Mars has had in trying to meet its objectives, what about the the specific question of deforestation? Has his Mars been able to accomplish much there? Specifically? Uh, no, not yet. And I think you know another one way of thinking about this, David, I think, is that the, um is the problem of deforestation is contributing about 10 the equivalent of about 10% of global greenhouse gases. So that's an important element on the one hand. Unlike a lot of other producers of greenhouse gases, the agricultural sector knows what methods it could use to to slow down or even stop the process of deforestation. The problem is getting people to actually implement them, and especially when you're talking about, you know, two million small cocoa farmers and you've got the same problem in Indonesia with palm oil, and we're all, you know, pretty aware of the problems in the Amazon to with soy. So this is, ah, global problem, and it's tantalizing because the solutions don't seem that complicated, but actually making it happen is very difficult. But of course, this is why there exist some treaties. Ah, that that deal with questions like, Ah, deforestation. You would think that the government of some of these West African countries, we would be in their interest to do what they can because specifically, as you've reported, ah, lot of this deforestation takes place on public land. And even if it weren't taking place on public land, it seems to me that ah, there are things that that governments can do to try to combat this problem just from the standpoint of of regulation. Well, that's true. But you know, uh, Africa is a tough place to do business. I actually covered Africa for the Wall Street Journal back in the eighties. I've been to bed a dozen countries there. There's a lot of corruption. There's other things, a lot of regulation that make it very difficult to get things done. There's a consulting firm that's warned investors that the Ivory Coast is very corrupt. It's got a corruption index worldwide corruption index, and it's placed Ivory Coast, you know, in a in a bad spot on that list so that in addition in defense of those of those governments. Even the best efforts are are hard thio to deal with. They have tremendous my number of migrants coming down into the Ivory Coast from Burkina Faso in ***, and these people are eager to have food and, ah, lot of them set up in the national forests and start cutting trees and and selling Coco. It's about eking out an existence in many cases, I suppose, absolutely, I do quote someone in my story is saying, You know this. He's not really thinking about climate change. She's thinking about about making a living. How fair is it? I mean, here we are in the developed world. Ah, lecturing, um others that ah, you know, West West African governments You should doom or or telling a farmer. Ah, look, what you're doing is is harming the environment at large, and and yet chocolate is not a necessity. I think you're right. I mean, there's nothing. There's nothing fair about climate change. I'm afraid, Ah, that people who are best able to adapt are the people with the most money. The people who are suffering the most are the people who have the fewest resource is and and it's been a big reason why we've seen so much migration around the world. No matter. No matter where you're talking about Bangladesh, west coast of Africa, people flocking into Europe, climate has has not isn't the only thing to blame, but it is a factor. And it's a factor that's probably going to grow. Okay, well, then let's blue sky this for a moment. Is it possible to have ah, sustainable chocolate pipeline? I mean, is it is anyone out there? Have you noticed any company out there that's trying to do this? Beyond what say Mars is it has has announced that it wants to do well. I think Mars and a lot of other companies are looking at, um, at some possible solutions. And they would include better use of satellite data because, um, we haven't really They haven't really applied satellite data in in in a big way in these areas. So and and then you need a lot more people on the ground. I mean, I don't I don't think that Mars really has too many people on the ground. And in order to monitor this, you're gonna have to do that. So you're gonna need Thio. See where people are, where the farms are, you have to notice in a timely fashion when they're when they're contours air changing, you have to cut off payments to them at that time. Uh, it's it's a lot, and it's gonna it's gonna take, and it's gonna cut into margins and profits, and that's that's gonna be difficult. But there really is in any other way to deal with this phenomenon because you really need to have that kind of very granular information, and you need it on a very broad scale so that you can do something about it. You need to have the kind of data that you could see from, uh, uh, miles miles above planet Earth. Right. And even that is difficult because a lot of the cutting takes place beneath the tree canopy. So so that even the satellite data might not pick up the first signs that people are settling in to these forested areas. You've written about a company called Berry Kalombo. What is it that that Barry Kalombo has done so They they're sort of working on this very thing and they've ah also cataloguing who's living on these places that I have a lot of information about family sizes. Um, they have 300 people on the ground monitoring things s, oh, it's a big effort, although again it's it's a fraction of the whole industry, but it is does seem like a step in the right direction. Um, I mentioned a few minutes ago that that, you know, chocolate is a luxury, and I was thinking, if I were in your shoes Steven, it might be hard to see candy the same way as Ah, I might have before I went into this kind of reporting. Do you has this changed the way that you think about candy and chocolate in particular? I do think about it, although I must say I like certain kinds of chocolate products. But I have spoken to several people here who have stopped eating chocolate, at least stopped eating it for now. Um, I think it's also important to remember that we do a lot of things that that are bad for the ah, the Earth's climate. Um, how did you get to work to the well, I I took a car, of course. All right, Well, There you go. I mean, you know each of us in his own way, his or her own way is is doing something. And I think part of the point of the articles that we're doing here is to try to get people to reassess that and to think of things that they could do differently. Policies that policies that we could that we could adopt. That mate points us in a different direction. So do you still indulge? Do you have a favorite chocolate? I do actually have a lot. My wife makes a mean and kids make me in chocolate cake. And I love chocolate chip cookies. Although I have been coming back of those, but I had already been cutting back in them for other reasons for regular health. I totally understand. And I'm with you. There are 100% but, you know, a seriously after reporting on this industry, what are your sort of reflections on how this industry has come about and what it takes to produce chocolate on a mass scale? I mean, is this is this something that, um well, I'll just leave the question open there. What? What do you what do you make of the chocolate industry now that you've been reporting on it? Well, it's like a lot of commodity industries, you know, it's got a lot of far flung growers or suppliers that's got big middlemen. Cargill's big not only company like Arpels not only big and cocoa, but in sugar and wheat. Uh, and, um, I think that they play very big roles in certain countries. Ah, that become very dependent on those commodities. And I think that's true from place to place around the world. It just might might not be Coco, but it might be something else. And development in a lot of those places is very challenging. And there's a lot of poverty. So I you know, I saw a lot of that when I was covering Africa. And it's not just Africa, it's it's all sorts of other places. Steven Mufson is a reporter for The Washington Post, and he covers the business of climate change. We're gonna have a link to his story.

S. It's July 2002 and in the Friendly's restaurant in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Richard Zimmerman pushes his burger and fries away from him. Sorry, but I'm in no mood to eat. The retired Hershey CEO looks across the table at his old friend Bruce McKinney, the former boss of the town's theme park. The two meet regularly to shoot the breeze, but today their mood is downright sour. And that's because this morning the Wall Street Journal revealed that the Hershey Foods Corporation is up for sale. McKinney looks at Zimmerman with a hangdog expression. I just don't get why the trust would sell. Why would they do this to the town and the company? The trust beginnings talking about is the Hershey Trust Company, and it manages the $5 billion endowment Milton Hershey, left to his school for orphans and underprivileged kids. The trust keeps most of the money invested in Hershey Foods Corporation shares, giving it the controlling interest in the chocolate giant. They're spooked Bruce after Enron in the dot com crash. The trust thinks it's dangerous to keep all its money invested in one company. McKinney grimaces, but they're not short on cash. The school's only got 1000 students when I served on the trust's board. We spent most of our time trying to think of new ways to spend millions on the school. Her She's hardly been a bad investment for them. Yeah, I guess they feel they've gotta maximize returns for the school. But you know what really worries me is the buyer. And what happens if the new owner relocates the headquarters or shuts the factory without the company? This town is finished. It's a betrayal, Richard. A total and utter betrayal. This will rip apart Milton's legacy. But you know, what can we do? Zimmerman leans closer. We fight Bruce, that's what we do. We might be retired, but we still got influence in this town. Let's use it. Let's get people protest ng. Even if we fail, well, at least we tried Yeah, yeah, you're right. This is no time to be a bystander. In the days that follow the pears spur the town into action. Residents put up don't shut down chocolate town signs on the front lawns. Company executives, union reps, local businessmen and politicians hold rallies and speak out against the sale. Journalists bring the town's fight to national attention. Hundreds of residents marched down Chocolate Avenue waving placards, and Pennsylvania's attorney general files a court petition designed to stop her. She from being sold without judge's approval. But the trust won't back down and buyers are lining up. Nestle and Cadbury Schweppes unite to offer $10 billion for her. She then chewing gum giant Wrigley jumps in with a $12.5 billion bid. Hershey's days of independence seemed numbered. Protests have failed. Only the courts can save her. She from take over Now Business wars is brought to you by the capital. One.

On the last episode, Mars tried clinging to the number one spot by focusing on its biggest brands. But the plan failed and her she pulled ahead with a barrage of new products. But now her she faces a new threat. The charitable trust that owns the controlling stake in her. She wants to sell the business. This is Episode six Global Chocolate Domination. It's September 2002 and in a hotel meeting room in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, the Hershey Trust is holding an emergency board meeting. There's an air of panic in the room, and that's because of court has just slapped an injunction on the trust, barring it from selling Hershey to Wrigley. The trust's CEO, Robert Valor, sits at the head of the table. His brow is furrowed, and he's got dark circles under his eyes as the public face of the trust. He's taking most of the flak from opponents of the sale. He's even had death threats. This injunction is the last thing he needs. I'll be frank. None of our options are ideal. We can cancel the sale or we can spend significant time and money fighting the injunction. The board is split on whether to give up on selling Hershey. They debate the options for hours. Afternoon becomes evening midnight passes, and still there's no agreement. Eventually, valor calls a vote. We're going around in circles. We need a decision. All right, all those who want to proceed with the sale raise your hands. Valor counts the votes. 1257 anymore. Okay, well, who thinks we should abandon the sale? The remaining 10 board members raised their hands. The sale is off her. She will remain independent, but the reprieve comes at a cost. Relations between the company and the trust are now in tatters, and that means there's sure to be trouble ahead. It's November 2005 before dawn in Shanghai. In a small, rickety back street warehouse surrounded by shiny new skyscrapers, eager salesmen are lining up for candy as rain beats on the corrugated metal roof. Above them, the salesman wait their turn at the front of the line, their supervisor hands out boxes full of dove bars, Eminem's and Snickers. After collecting their boxes, the salesman strapped them onto their bicycles, Don Dove, branded chocolate brown jackets and pedal off, ready to spend the day putting candy into stores across the city. These salesmen are the foot soldiers of Mars is campaign for global chocolate domination, and there are hundreds just like them in every major Chinese city. Her She might have pushed Mars into second place in America, But these days, Mars is a company that thinks global, not local. When Mars began exporting candy to China in 1980 it seemed an UN promising market. Chocolate was an unfamiliar Western luxury. Air conditioned stores and refrigerated trucks were unknown, but Mars didn't back off. Instead, it kept investing, enduring 25 years of losses to stake its claim on the world's most populous nation, one that was growing more prosperous and eager for Western treats. With every passing year, now it's Chinese operation is profitable. The Dove brand now accounts for 39% of all chocolates sold in China, and China's only the star. Mars is also using the money it makes in the West toe advance into the Middle East, Russia and beyond. Eminem's Snickers and Dove are now global brands that jostle with Nestle is Kit Kat in Cadbury's dairy milk for shelf space in stores all over the world. But while all the world's a stage for Mars, her she's got stage fright. After World War Two, her she shunned taking risky investments overseas, preferring to maximize profits at home. But now, ah, global opportunity beckons. January 2007 Orlando, Florida Hershey CEO Richard Lenny enters the elevator of the Ritz Carlton and presses the button for the top floor. The silver haired Hershey boss isn't sure why he's here. All he knows is that Todd Stitzer, the CEO of Cadbury Schweppes, once a one on one Lenny, exits the elevator and knocks on the door of Stitzer is sweet. Stitzer opens the door. He's wearing a suit and tie and looks every bit the Harvard trained lawyer. He is. Good to see you, Richard. Please come in. The pair sits on tan couches surrounding a mirrored coffee table. Okay, Todd, what's this all about? I want to talk a merger. Lenny surprised Hershey and Cadbury of Long flirted with merging, but it's been at least two decades since the company's last seriously talked about joining forces. Combining our companies make sense. You're strong in the U. S. Were strong everywhere but the U. S. You're like the missing piece in our jigsaw and vice versa. Also, we share the same cultural values we both believe in giving back to our communities, Sure, but we're not equals yourself. Drink division makes you significantly bigger than us. Let's be honest. You're really talking about a takeover, aren't you? Actually, we're going to sell the beverage division, and after that's gone, it be Maura merger of equals. I'm thinking Global headquarters in Hershey. You as chairman, Me is CEO. Lenny likes the sound of that. He can't help but smile. Naturally, I'll need to consult my board. Of course. One question. Well, the Hershey trust be a problem. Lenny pauses relations between him and the trust our frosty at best, but he's not telling states or that if the deal's right, I'm sure they'd get on board. It's April 2007 and Hershey Trust CEO Robert Valor flicks through the business section of his newspaper. In his office in Hershey, he spots a story about Cadbury selling its beverages arm and endorsing a merger with her. She puzzled Balor picks up the phone and calls. Lenny Richard, I've got a newspaper in front of me and innit? Cadbury's Todd Stitzer is talking about merging with her. She any idea what that's about? He proposed it to me back in January. We're going to explore it Mawr after they sell their drinks. Business January. That's four months ago. Why the hell wasn't I informed? I notified the company's board. It's January meeting. It's not my fault if your representative on our board didn't tell you I'm the CEO of your biggest shareholder. You should tell me directly. No, that's your representatives job. I work for the Hershey Foods Corporation, not the trust. Fowler slams down the phone. Seething. He decides that if there's a deal to be done with Cadbury, Trust will be the one making it. It's September 2007 and in a luxury Manhattan hotel, the Hershey Trust is holding talks with Cadbury and Lenny's not invited. Valor starts by pressing the Cadbury team for information. We want Maur detail on how you think the merger will affect the town of Hershey. Cadbury's lead negotiator leans back in his chair. Actually, we're cooling somewhat on this merger. What why the credit crisis it's making it harder to sell up beverages unit. Also, Hershey's latest results there disappointing, so we no longer think it's the right time to merge. Valor leaves the meeting empty handed and fuming. He knows can Berries right? Her. She is underperforming. Sales are down. Stock prices plunged nearly 30% in two years, leaving the trust of $1,000,000,000 worse off. He decides it's time the trust flexes its muscles in the aftermath of the aborted talks with Cadbury. Ah, power struggle breaks out between Hershey and its most powerful shareholder. The trust accuses the company of misleading it about the Cadbury merger. The company claims the trust is twisting the facts. The trust demands her. She fired two of its board members. The company refuses. The trust forces them out anyway, in response, ate her. She board members resigned on the same day. The trust replaces them, with its own people tightening its grip on the business. But as infighting consumes, Hershey, Mars is plotting a major move. April 2008 McLean, Virginia William Wrigley sits at the kitchen table in the home of Mars President Paul Michaels as Michael's fixes sandwiches. The heir to the chewing gum. Empire wonders what's in store. All Mars would say on the phone is it wants to talk sandwiches ready. Michaels joins Wrigley at the table. So you're wondering why I wanted to meet you, right? Wrigley Sandwich in hand? Smiles would be nice to know. Well, we want to buy the Wrigley Company. We think it's a good cultural fifth for us, our products, a complimentary and Wrigley's international distribution at work offers strong synergies for our brands, especially in China. Wrigley puts his sandwich down, and you replace Cadbury is the world's biggest confectioner. Now it's Michael's turn to smile. Yeah, that, too. Wrigley pauses to think his family still owns most of the company's stock, and since he used to run the business, his relatives will follow his lead if he backs selling to Mars. This is a done deal, all right, How much money are you offering? $23 billion. All cash, no stock. Wrigley does the mat. The offer's 32 times Wrigley's annual earnings. It's too good to refuse. I'm interested, but I need to know you've got the money. I don't want to put the company through this. If you don't I understand. Give us a week. It's two days later, and in his office in Omaha, Nebraska, multi billionaire investor Warren Buffett cracks open a can of Cherry Coke. He's about to take a swig when his phone rings. This is War in a War and Byron Trott from Goldman Sachs here. I'm calling on behalf of Mars. Buffet sits up. He's a big fan of Mars. Mars wants to buy Wrigley, but to get the deal, they need a partner to put in a large chunk of cash. They've got most of the money, but they need another $4.4 billion. They need it in cash, and they need it fast. So you interested? You know, Byron, I've been conducting a 70 year taste test of Mars and Wrigley Products on. I've got to say both passed the test. Yeah, count me in On April 24th 2008 just 13 days after Wrigley's meeting in McLean, the deal is done. It's a lightning strike takeover that stuns the industry and Wall Street Mars is now the world's biggest confectioner. For her, she it's another sign that it's getting left behind in the global chocolate war. next to Mars, Cadbury Nestle and craft her. She is looking increasingly provincial. It's not even one of the world's top five confectioners her. She knows there's one deal that would change everything. A merger with Cadbury. But if her she wants that to happen, it needs to act fast. And that's because another rival is already stalking the British chocolate giant.

Plus, All right, it's August 2009 And in a meeting room inside a West London office block, Cadbury Chairman Roger Car waits for a visitor cars a battle hardened 63 year old businessman. And he's expecting a fight. A woman with short brown hair and a red power suit enters the room. She's Irene Rosenfeld, the CEO of Craft, the multinational giant that owns best selling European chocolate brands Milka and Toblerone. Rosenfeld takes a seat, ignores the fresh pots of tea and coffee on the table and gets to business. Roger, I have a great idea. We buy Cadbury Car maintains his poker face. Rosenfels Stone Cold intensity is already rubbing him the wrong way. We're doing very well as an independent company. Thanks. We don't need craft. Rosenfeld doesn't bat an eyelid. She spent two years prepping for this moment, and she knows Cadbury won't roll over easily. I will courier and offer to you this afternoon. I'd like a response. Within a week after Rosenfeld leaves car size, he knows Cadbury's in for the fight of its life. That afternoon, Cadbury's board gathers at Goldman Sachs offices on Fleet Street for an emergency meeting. Car informs the Board of Crafts offer. They're offering $10.2 billion in cash and stock. I say we rejected it undervalues us and Craft only wants us because they're a low growth business. We don't need them. They need us. The board agrees. They're also worried that Craft will gut the company. Just a few years ago, Kraft shut down the factory of its British chocolate subsidiary, Terry's and move production to Eastern Europe. Car sends Rosenfeld a letter politely telling craft to get lost, but Rosenfeld's already gamed this scenario. She responds by going public with the takeover offer. The move encourages speculators to snap up Cadbury stock in hopes of making a fast buck from a craft takeover. But it also alerts Hershey two crafts plan. It's October 2008 and in 1/17 century London hotel suite. Cadbury Chairman Roger Cars meeting with her. She's new CEO David West. They both want to stop craft by bringing Cadbury and Hershey together, but they're about to hit a wall. A car sits in a red velvet armchair and lobs a question at the bespectacled Hershey boss, Can we count on the Hershey Trust to support a merger? Well, they are worried about ceding control of her. She car frowns. I don't know what to say that we're twice your size. Our shareholders won't accept a merger where the trust maintains majority control. If they want that, you need to buy us, and I don't think you can afford that. West rubs the back of his head. I'm exploring financing options. Listen, if the will is there on all sides, we can do this. They need to think big picture we all know and have known for decades that Hershey and Cadbury are wonderful. Match West promises to return with a concrete offer, but time's running out. Rosenfeld is stepping up crafts attack. She announces a hostile takeover bid and raises her offer to $17 billion. And she tours Britain and the United States, encouraging Cadbury stockholders to embrace her plan events. Our fast slipping out of Cadbury's control Only her. She can rescue them from craft. Now it's January 2010 and Hershey CEO David West is back in London, and this time he's got an offer for Cadbury. As Car listens, West lays out the details. We're making a solo bid for Cadbury, and it's got the support of the Hershey Trust cars. Heart lifts at last. A ray of Hope West continues. Our offer is $11.7 billion. Car stares at West in disbelief. Her. She's offering $6 billion less than craft. That's too low. We can't sell that to our shareholders. It needs to be higher. West looks down on the floor. He tried to put a good face on it, but he knew it was unlikely Cadbury would accept such a low offer. Unfortunately, that's the best I can do. The trust won't let us borrow Maur because it might damage our credit rating car shakes his head. I'm sorry, but that offer is unacceptable. We'll take crafts over that. Shortly after her, she drops out of the fight for Cadbury. On January 18th 2010. Cadbury's board submits to crafts. Take over. Two years later, Rosenfeld spins off crafts, candy and snack business to create a new candy superpower, Mondelez International and the years that follow her. She boosts its overseas presence, advise Indian and Chinese chocolate makers. But the company is decades behind the competition, and it may never catch up with experienced global players like Mars and Mondo Lease. But back home, things were very different. Every year there's a chance to blow out the competition. The candy tsunami begins every October. Stores overflow with Halloween Candies buying for the attention of the tricker treaters. Halloween is the US candy industry Super Bowl. In 2019 Americans will spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $4.5 billion on Halloween candy, swelling the coppers of whichever manufacturer created the holidays. Most eye catching confections, Hershey's is pushing pumpkin pie, kick cats and jack O lantern shaped peanut butter cups. Meanwhile, Mars is dressing up M and M's and glow in the dark rappers and daring people to try zombie Skittles with flavors like Mama, Vied Melon and Rotten Zombie. Yet this annual showdown is unlikely to shift the balance of power in Candy Land. Her She's been America's top candy makers since the mid nineties. Mars is status is the world's biggest confectioner. Seems solid, too. But the current stalemate between Hershey and Mars doesn't mean they've stopped fighting. They got to stay hungry and keep battling just to cling onto the sweet profits they're already making.

S. It's April 1976 and in a resort hotel nestled in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. Hershey's top executives are facing the biggest challenge yet in the company's history. Two and 1/2 years ago, Mars ousted her. She is America's candy king. The victory was no fluke. Mars relentlessly focused on conquering the market and outmaneuvered the insular and tradition bound Hershey. Now her, she's new CEO Bill Dearden wants to turn the tables. The 53 year old CEO stands before his team in a room overlooking a tranquil lake. He owes everything to her. She, when he lost his mother at 13 his future looked bleak. But then he got a place at her. She's school for orphans. Now he wants to repay the Hershey chocolate company by leading it back to glory. He scrawls the word strategy on a flip chart a strategy. That's what we've always lack, and it's what we need now. I'm not expecting a change to happen overnight. What we're doing here is building a Ford Model T a Ford Model T that will one day become a Rolls Royce. Over the next few hours, Dearden and the team hammer out a comeback plan. They'll restart advertising after a five year hiatus. They'll identify companies to buy. They'll develop new candy bars and they will become number one again. Strategies vague. But for the first time since World War to her, she knows where it's heading. The executives know it won't be easy. Mars is a ruthless, aggressive and powerful rival that will stop at nothing to beat them. Victory is far from certain and failure a distinct possibility. But the team also knows that they've got something Mars doesn't a reason to fight. That goes deeper than the pursuit of profit. They're fighting for more than the bottom line. They're fighting for the town, their families and friends call home. They're fighting for the orphans whose lives will be transformed by the profits they make. They're fighting for Milton Hershey's belief that business must improve society, not just lying pockets and to fail is to put all of that at risk. Business wars is brought to you by the capital one.

But after President Nixon imposed Price controls her, she stopped advertising and Mars became America's top confectioner in 1974. Victorious at last, Forrest Mars leaves on a high by handing over the company to his son's Forrest Jr and Jon. Now the Mars brothers want to ensure her she never regains its lost crown. This is Episode five, a chocolate Rolls Royce. It's 1977 and Jack Dowd rushes into the test kitchen inside her. She's Pennsylvania headquarters. Doubt is the head of new products. In five minutes ago, he got a call from the kitchen, a call he's waited months for. He makes a beeline for the head chef. So you think you got it this time? I do I to take a seat. I'll get the sample. Batch doubt hops onto a stool by the kitchen island. The head chef brings over a bowl filled with small yellow, orange and brown Candies. Here you are, recent pieces doubt, and his team dreamed up the idea of months ago. He wanted a product to directly challenge Eminem's. He knows consumers can't resist the salty, sweet combination of chocolate and peanut butter and Reese's peanut butter cups. So what if he shrunk them and added a little crunch little candy coated spheres that you could down by the handful like M and M's, but with a secret weapon inside smooth peanut butter? For months, the kitchen's tried different recipes without success. The oil and peanut butter kept turning the candy shell soggy. It seemed like an impossible challenge, but now now they think they cracked it. Dowd grabs a yellow candy from the bowl, pops it in his mouth and bites shell cracks. He tastes creamy milk, chocolate, and then the taste of peanut butter spreads over his tongue like a wave. It's just as he imagined after trying a fume, or he turns to the head. Chef. These are great. What's the secret? A new peanut butter recipe? Actually, we gave up on peanut butter. We used Panucci instead. Basically peanut butter flavored fudge. Same consistency, same taste, but not exactly peanut butter. Dowd shovels a handful of Reese's pieces into his mouth. Well, I don't care, because I think these thes are fantastic. Armed with this breakthrough her, she readies itself. Tow, launch recess pieces. It runs tests in select markets, and the response is great. Consumers go nuts for these new treats. By 1979 Reese's pieces are ready to go national, but before they do, a new report from the test markets lands on Dowd's desk. He scans it and immediately races to the office of Hershey CEO Bill. Dear Bill, you've got to read this. What is it? The latest sales figures from the Reese's Pieces test market. Dearden scans the report. It's bad news. Reese's pieces launched with a bang, but now the novelty is wearing. Often people are drifting back to M and M's Dearden looks a doubt face full of concern. Should we cancel the national rollout? Ah, no, no, I don't think so. The declines. Not critical, just disappointing With Rite ads, I'm sure we can turn it around. The launch is still a go, but the omens are bad. Reese's pieces just aren't the Eminem's killer they'd hoped for. Not that Dowd's got time to fret. Hershey's comeback strategy rests on his team, bringing three new products to market every year. So as Reese's pieces head to the stores he focuses on rolling out other Candies. To nibble away at Mars is market share her. She launches a chocolate covered toffee bar called Score, then combines chocolate, caramel and peanut flavored Rice Krispies to create a confection. It dubs watch Emma Colin, and it wraps pretzels with peanut butter, caramel and peanut chunks in milk chocolate to create gooey and crunchy Take five bars. Together with Reese's pieces, these new suites turned the tide after years of decline. Her she's slowly clawing back, lost market share, but her she's efforts to regain momentum haven't gone unnoticed. It's early, 1980 John Mars pulled his aging jeep into the lot of a bland three storey office in McLean, Virginia. This is Mars headquarters, and it's as understated as the company's co president. John Mars is one of America's richest men, but you've never know what to look at him. The 44 year old wears scuffed shoes, dorky glasses in a pocket protector. His polyester suit looks straight out of Macy's discount section. He enters the office through the back door, punches the time card and heads for the meeting room on the second floor. On the way, he passes black metal desks with copies of the company Bible, the Five Principles of Mars and an actual butcher's block. It's there to remind employees they could get shot next. If they don't live up to expectations, John enters the glass wall meeting room. The team that's about to present to him is already there. John sits in an uncomfortable plastic chair, so you have a plan to stop her. She's recent gains. The team leader nods. Our plan is a two pronged attack that will make her she products look like bad value. Now our intelligence unit predicts that Takeo prices will fall in the near term. We want to use the savings to make our candy bars 10 to 20% bigger without raising prices. John folds his arms. What's that supposed to achieve? It'll create a dilemma for her. She while increasing our sales, you see their biggest products or solid chocolate, and if they try to copy our size increase, it'll destroy their profits. But if they don't follow suit, well, they're bars will seem like bad value. You get it. What about our profit margins? What happens when ingredient costs rise again after the sales boost from the larger bars will just raise prices by a nickel? We predict her. She won't follow that either. John slams his fist on the table. He's inherited his father's explosive temper. You want to let her she undercut us? That's your brilliant plan. The team leader doesn't flinch. Employees who can't hold their own don't last long. And Mars, If we raise our wholesale price, major retailers will raise the retail price of all candy bars. It's easier for people working the tills. The result is Hershey bars will look small and expensive compared to ours, John leans back in smiles. Okay, let's do it within weeks, pumped up Snickers and Milky Ways, or arriving in stores heralded by full page newspaper ads, as predicted her she refuses to follow suit. Sales of Mars products leap by as much as 250%. Hershey's steady advance sputters to a halt. A few months later, Mars quietly increases its prices and, as expected, big stores respond by raising the price of all candy bars. Mars gets another sales boost. As consumers starts snubbing Hershey bars for being thin and overpriced her, she finds itself forced to increase its prices and bar sizes just to stop Mars, peeling off any more customers. But then Mars gives her she a golden opportunity. It's October 1981 and in her she's Pennsylvania headquarters. A member of the new products team is on a call with Universal Studios. He listens as the movie studios Rap explains why she's called. We're filming a new movie. It's about an alien that befriends a boy. It's called E T. E T. Extraterrestrial, right? So where do we fit in? But the script calls for the boy to lure E. T. Into his house with Eminem's, but Mars rejected the opportunity, so we want to use Reese's pieces. You interested the Hershey man? Most definitely. Is sales of Reese's pieces air fading? The company is willing to try anything to revive them. The following week, jacked out in the new products team head to the office of Earl Spangler, Spangler's the head of Hershey's chocolate division. But he's not keen on paying Universal a $1,000,000 just to feature Reese's pieces in E. T. Aren't the public sick of Sky wars and all that jazz yet? Earl, this is a Steven Spielberg movie. You know, the guy who did Johns and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spangler's unmoved. So a team member races back to their floor and returns with a life size cardboard cutout of E. T that Universal set them. But Spangler's face drops at the site of the wrinkly alien. What is that thing? It's disgusting. Get the hell out of my office. We're not doing this movie. The next day, the team returned to Spangler's office in bag him to reconsider. Eventually, their refusal to let the matter drop wears him down. He agrees to let the team put Reese's pieces in E. T. Provided they foot the bill from their existing budget. It's June 1982 and the movie theater in Hershey, Pennsylvania, is holding an early showing of E T. Spangler endowed Sit in the middle row, munching Reese's pieces, Hershey's bet. Big on E. T. The company's spending millions on E T theme promotions. And now they're about to see if the film justifies the hype. As the credits roll, lights go up, the audience stands and applauds, Dowd turns to Spangler, Spangler's eyes red with tears, Stealth and E. T s ugly Earl Spangler blows his nose. No, no, he's beautiful. The bottom line is beautiful to sales of recent species triple and orders from stores flood in. Rumors circulate that the enraged Mars brothers fired the team that missed the chance to put Eminem's in e T E T isn't Mars is only error. While her she grabs market share with new Candies, the Mars brothers are doubling down on their winners. They only care about blockbuster products like Snickers that deliver more than $100 million a year in sales. They even stopped making profitable Candies that fall short of this sky. High Target and his marsh vacates the middle tier of the market her. She fills the gap when Mars kills off its KitKat rivals summit for only doing $40 million of business a year. Her she capitalizes with a new ad push for Kit Kat, based around a new, catchy jingle. By the late 19 eighties, Hershey's Ford Model T is fast becoming a sleek Rolls Royce that's closing in on Mars. And then, in 1987 her she hits the gas pedal by buying the US candy operation of Britain's Cadbury Schweppes. The $300 million deal gives her she control of brands like mounds in York peppermint Patties as well as the right to make Cadbury cream eggs in America overnight. Hershey Leap Frogs Mars after 14 years in the number two spot, Hershey's back on top and a full seven points ahead of Mars in market share. But while Mars is feeling better now, before long, her she's lied will start to melt. Business wars is sponsored by nets.

McLean, Virginia John Mars sits at his desk with the man he hopes will take his company back to the top. That man is Alpo. He's a tall 32 year old marketing executive, and he's spent the past few years helping turn around. Mars is pet food business. Now John hopes, Poke and take his kibble knowledge and throw a bone to its candy line. Regaining market leadership in candy is the priority out now. How would you do it? Po already has a plan. It's the same one he used to boost interest in the company's pet food. New products. I think John frowns New products are a good way to lose money. The new products I'm thinking up will be line extensions will apply our established brands to new products to give them instant consumer recognition. New varieties of Eminem's and Snickers or solid chocolate bars bearing the Dove ice cream brand. You know things like that. Won't these just cannibalize sales of our big brands? Sure, that's a risk. But line extensions increased interest in pedigree and whiskers and attracted new customers. Now I see no reason why that won't work for candy, too. If people get excited by new varieties of pet food, when it seems obvious they get excited by new varieties of their favorite candy, too. We should also launch new products that directly challenge her. She's most popular items. That way we can limit their gains. John, still worried about the risk, but post sales pitch has convinced him he stands up. It extends his hand. Welcome to the candy division, AL. You start tomorrow as head of marketing over the next three years, Po takes Mars, fond of the offensive company, launches new twists on its biggest brands. Snickers with almonds, dark chocolate, Milky Way, peanut butter, M and M's. They also introduced dove bars to lure people away from her. She's milk chocolate bars. Some moves failed. Po brings out a chocolate covered coconut bar called Bounty to challenge her. She's mounds, but Bounty fails to replicate its European success in the U. S. Bumps aside, Mars steadily erodes her. She's lied, and by 1991 2 rivals are neck and neck again. Feeling the heat her, she fires back with its own line extensions. Soon the chocolate war descends into trench warfare. Mars launches a reduced calorie milky way. Her, she counters with a diet bar of its own. Her she introduces kisses with almonds, Mars Perry's With Almond, Eminem's and its own answer to kisses. Many chocolate squares called Dove promises. But slowly her, she gains the upper hand thanks to its focus on new product development. First, it scores big by moving in on the under exploited demand for white chocolate with cookies and cream and Hershey's hugs. It's the same, and it's different. It's new. Hershey's hugs, hugs or mini Hershey's kisses hugs my white chocolate her. She is also first to spot the big bucks to be made from selling seasonal bags of Candies at Halloween, Christmas and Easter. With its marketing muscle her, she crushes the specialty candy makers who once dominated the holidays, earning tens of millions in the process. Meanwhile, Mars is finding its blockbusters aren't delivering like they used to. Reese's peanut butter cups are now threatening Snickers position as America's top selling candy. And even worse, Eminem's are in serious trouble. Eminem's have become so every day that people are forgetting about them. Mars tries reviving interest by replacing Tan Eminem's with blue ones, but it's not enough. So the company asks New York ad agency BBDO for help. It's 1995 and a Mars team is in the conference room at B B D. OES Madison Avenue office is BBDO creative directors. Susan Cradle leads the pitch. What Eminem's currently lacks is personality. A way to stand out. Our proposal is that we turn the Eminem animated characters into a comedic ensemble. Each M and M Color will have its own personality. Cradle clicks a button on the laptop rigged up to the rooms. Projector Ah, lineup of computer generated Eminem's characters appears on the screen. We think of them like a gang of court jesters. Red will be the sarcastic backstabber. Yellow. A dimwitted peanut green will be the sultry women. Why go Go Boots Blue is the cool. The Morris executives approved the plan, and the refreshed Eminem spokes Candies make their debut during the 1996 Super Bowl. Just your friendly neighborhood. Mmm, it on same Eminem's that come in the back ones. Well, then I'm really glad you came by. Who was that? Because I'm all out of here is delicious. New Eminem's characters shake off the brand stale image, and sales start climbing again after years of decline. But it's too little, too late. By summer 1999 her She's far ahead of Mars in America's $9 billion a year candy market. Her she boasts a 27% share, while Mars trails with 17%. But now that her she's secured dominance in America, there's a new threat. The companies controlling shareholder is still the orphan school founded by Milton Hershey, and it's thinking that now might be a good time to cash in its chips by selling off America's top chocolate maker. On the next episode, her she goes on the block. Mars Allies with Warren Buffett and Hershey and Craft compete for Cadbury's hand in marriage from wondering. This is business wars.

The executive stare at their stocky leader with his neat, contoured hair. He looks worried. I got a letter from Mars this morning. They're starting to make their own chocolate and will stop using hours over the next few years. The executives are stunned. Why would they do that? That's crazy. It'll be more expensive for them to make chocolate than to buy it from ice. Another executive nods in agreement. It'll cost him walk around 20 million just to start production. They will recoup that investment for years. But what the Hershey team doesn't get is that Forrest Mars isn't thinking about next year or even the next five. The Mars company's head Han Show is thinking long term. Forest also knows that he can't launch an all out attack on her. She if he depends on them for chocolate. But there's another, more immediate reason to do it, too. Mahler turns to her. She's chief accountant. How much will losing large business cost us? We're looking at losing 10 maybe 20% of our annual revenue. The executives gasp. They knew Mars was a big customer, but they always thought Mars needed them more than they needed Mars. Mahler tries to stay positive. Maybe this is a good thing. Supplying other companies with chocolate is a distraction, you know, stops us focusing on the consumer market. Maybe this is the push we need to wind down that side of the business. But the truth is Mahler's deeply worried. Since Forrest took charge last Christmas, Mars has gone dark, no longer attends trade shows. It doesn't speak to the press, and it's withdrawn from the National Confectioners Association. Mahler doesn't know what forests up to, but he knows in his gut it can't be good. For the first time ever, the Hershey Chocolate Company feels vulnerable, whether your reaction is who excellent or I Corumba. This is definitely some exciting news.

Yeah, on the last episode, Forrest Mars to control of Mars and united it with M and M's and his European candy business food manufacturers. Now he's out to wrench America's candy bar crown from her. She this is Episode four Mars Attacks. It's 1965 and there's a new face wandering the corridors of the Hershey Chocolate Company. His name's John Raleigh, and he's just been hired to lead the marketing department, a department that so far consists of just him. He's the company's first ever head of marketing. Hershey CEO Harold Mahler brought Raleigh N to help fend off the threat from Mars. But First, Raleigh's gotta build a marketing department from scratch. And to do that, he needs information. Raleigh heads into the office of a sales manager. The salesman has been with her she for decades and is nearing retirement. Hey there, I'm John Raleigh, the new head of marketing. The salesman looks puzzled. Marketing What's that Raleigh size? Almost everyone in her. She asks him the same question. It's about using product price packaging and promotion to get people buying our chocolate. Don't we do that already? Not really. Let me put it another way. You sell candy bars into stores, right? Uh, well, my job, the job of marketing is to get those candy bars into people's shopping baskets and out of the stores. Sounds like an easy job. Our products sell themselves well. Anyway, I'm after a copy of this year's sales targets. You have them? The salesman grins. Oh, that's easy enough. The salesman spins around in his office chair to face the metal filing cabinet behind his desk. He opens a drawer, flicks through the folders and triumphantly pulls out a sheet of yellowing paper. Here you are. Raleigh stares at the document in disbelief. It's a one line memo that says Increase sales 4% every year. Raleigh checks the date. The memos. 11 years old. Is this really the latest sales target you've got? Yep. If it ain't broke, don't fix it right. If there's any hope of revamping this fossil of a company, Raleigh knows he needs to bring in outsiders. It's 1966 and Jack Dowd's laying on the bed in his room at the Cocoa in Hotel in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Dowd's a Bostonian marketing executive. He used to push Canada dry ginger ale, But tomorrow morning he's got an interview for a job at Hershey. Dowd's not sure he wants to be her. She's marketing manager, but he's intrigued by the opportunity. After all, her she's the only Fortune 500 company without a marketing department. He picks up the phone and calls home. Hey, dear, I just checked in at the hotel. So what's it like the hotel? No, but the town Hershey. You know that place we're going to move to if you take this job. Oh, well, it's ridiculous. Get this. I'm staying at the cocoa in right, and that's on the corner of cocoa and chocolate avenues, even the damn street lights or shaped like Hershey kisses. I can't picture us here, but well, let's see how the interview goes. The next morning, Dowd meets her she CEO Harold Mahler, for his final interview. Mahler leans over his desk and looks Dowd right in the eyes. Jack, there's something you need to understand about her. She we do not do advertising. Dowd folds his arms. I know, but I think that's going to change. Mahler leans back in his chair. And what makes you think that wine your market shares falling? Mahler nods reluctantly to your new products. Don't sell as well as your old ones. Yes, that's true. Three. Your products are more popular with the adults who grew up eating Hershey than with Children. Mahler looks away. Yeah, that's true to Dowd smiles, and that is why you're going to start advertising. The question isn't if it's when Dowd gets the job, his first task is to develop a marketing plan for every single item her she sells. Immediately, he hits a snag. The company makes a multitude of products and sells them in every package and size imaginable. Doubt decides he needs to eliminate the products that don't sell. So he asked for sales figures, only to discover that her she doesn't keep those records for individual products. He ends up hiring market researchers from Nielsen to investigate how his own company's products are selling. It's May 1967 Dowd's in an oak paneled meeting room and Hershey headquarters ready to hear Nielsen's findings. Right away, the lead researcher drops a bombshell. Jack, there's a finding. I want a flag. I think this is important. We found that Hershey products are out of stock 30% of the time. Dowd groans and puts his head in his hands. For most consumer goods companies, being out of stock 10% of the time would be a disaster. Her She's missing out on nearly 1/3 of its potential sales because it's not keeping candy bars flowing to stores. Mars would never make that mistake. Forrest Mars expects his sales team to keep every store the company supplies fully stocked with snickers, Eminem's and Milky Ways at all times. And when that doesn't happen, there's hell to pay. It's 1967 and in the Chicago offices of Mars, Forests just returned from a trip to Virginia. He walks through the austere Open Plan office and stops at the desk of marketing. Chief Builds, stirring. Hey, Bill, I went to a mom and pop store in Virginia, and guess what I found. Bill looks out before Forrest took over. He enjoyed working for Mars. Now he hates it. Forest. I have no idea. Forrest leans closer. Well, what I found in that store Bill was not a single Milky Way forest glances around to make sure the rest of the offices surreptitiously listening before turning back to Bill. The thing is, Bill, you're a nice guy, a nice guy with a nice family. But you're also the dumbest son of a bitch I've ever known. You're stupid. You ought to get out of here. Before Forest can continue, a colleague interrupts. It's Larry John's head of sales. Forest sails into stores. Isn't Bills responsibility? It's mine. Forest whips his head around to face John's and points an accusing finger right at John's. Well, in that case, I should fire you as well. Forest doesn't carry out his threat, but John's can see the writing on the wall soon after he resigns. He's got a new job. Head of sales at Hershey. It's 1968 and Johns is in Arkansas, sitting in the passenger seat of a Hershey's sales reps. Ford Galaxy. He's spending the day shadowing the Rep to get a better understanding of how her she sails. Operation works on the ground. He's curious because he knows from his time at Mars that Hershey salespeople are rarely seen in the field so rarely that it Mars. People joked there were like Bigfoot rumored to exist. But there's no proof. Salesman parks and retrieves a crate of Hershey candy bars from the back seat. John's follows as he heads toward the nearby A and P. But to John Surprise, the sales rep breezes right past the supermarket. Instead, he heads into a small convenience store and sells them his crate of candy. After leaving the store, Johns turns to the salesman. Why didn't you go to the A and P? There's no point. They buy everything centrally, sure, but you could make sure our products are in a good spot inside the store. In fact, let's do that right now. They enter the supermarket and start hunting for chocolate. They quickly find a display of Mars candy bars in a prime spot. But there's not a Hershey bar in sight. Eventually, near the back, right by the kitty litter, they find the Hershey bars. John's picks one up. It's dusty and past its sell by date. Back at headquarters, John's tells the company president Bill Dearden what he saw down South. I want the sales people fired. They haven't a clue. No wonder Mars is eating you for breakfast. Dearden shakes his head I'm not doing that. What? It's not their fault. It's ours. They're doing what we told them to do. We can't fire them for that. A cz The months passed The new marketing department uncovers more problems Everywhere they look, they see a company so behind the times, it could be a museum. It's a ziff. Time stopped the day Milton Hershey died, and the situation's about to turn critical. For years her she's sold its candy bars for a nickel despite spiraling ingredient costs. Mars upped its prices years ago, but her she's holding the line by shrinking the size of its five cent chocolate bars. But prices are still rising, and the bar's air now so thin they can't get any smaller. So in late 1969 Mahler bows to the inevitable. He orders the first price rise in her she's 75 year history, from five cents a bar to 10 cents to soften the blow to consumers. He doubles the size of Hershey bars. But it's not enough. Consumers have come to regard nickel Hershey bars as an enduring part of American life. Price hikes sparks a backlash Sales of Hershey bars plunged by 1/3. Suddenly her. She is in a position that would have been unthinkable just a decade ago. The company's once commanding lead over Mars has melted away. Now Mars and Hershey are neck and neck in market share. The chocolate war is balanced on a knife edge that's tipping in favor of Mars. Mahler knows the time has come. If her she is to stay Number one, it needs to start advertising before Mars pulls ahead.

The smartest Way to Hire It's late 1969 and Hershey CEO Harold Mahler's riding the elevator in a Manhattan hotel with him is her. She's chief counsel and a company vice president. They're here to forge a transatlantic alliance against Mars. They exit the elevator and enter a large suite where the delegation from British candy giant Roundtree McIntosh is waiting. A small, sprightly Scotsman with receding hair bounds over to greet them. He's Donald Baron, the chairman of Rowntree Macintosh. The two teams sit on a pair of leather couches and barren starts negotiations. We need a new U. S licensee for Kit Kat. Philip Morris isn't pushing it enough. We don't want Mars because they compete with us at home. We think her she could be the right fit. Kick cats. US. Sales might be only $2 million a year now, but if you promoted right, I promise it'll outsell her. She's almond. Baron Stairs is the Hershey Men tried not to laugh. Kit Kat, one of America's top Candies. Yeah, right, Mahler composes himself. Donald, I'm sorry that that was out of line. It's just that we have more modest expectations for Kit Kat, but we want the U. S. License. We need more chocolate coated bars to counter Mars. Over the next few hours, the team's thrash out a deal. They agree to a 30 year arrangement where her she will handle Kit Kat in America and pay royalties to Rowntree Macintosh. But then Baron raises a concern. I know you don't promote your own products, but you must advertise Kit Kat. Actually, we're going to start advertising. Really, that's great. But I still want guaranteed advertising in the contract. A few days after getting Kit Kat, Mahler returns to Manhattan to visit her. She's new ad agency on Madison Avenue. He enters the lobby with a spring in his step, eager to see her. She's first TV spots, the agency's creative director, loads of film into a projector. First up the Hershey Bar ad, he turns off the lights and on the screen, kindergartners feast on Hershey bars as a folksy tune plays like the face of a kid when he's much in on the greatest way. Next, the ad director accused the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup spot. People aren't keen on mixing chocolate and peanut butter. They think it's something people in the boondocks would eat. So we're starting by teaching people. It's a brilliant combination on the screen to teenagers walk down the street ones chomping on a chocolate bar, the others devouring peanut butter right out of the tub. They bump into each other. Hey, you got chocolate on my peanut butter. You got peanut butter in my chocolate. Really good, Yeah, two great tastes that taste great together, Reeses peanut butter cups. Real milk chocolate. Good old fashioned peanut butter. Mahler rises from his chair, clapping. These are excellent. In early 1970 the ads hit the air. Sales of Hershey bars jumped 30% but it's the Reese's peanut butter cups. Add that surprises everyone. Sales don't rise. They explode. Peanut butter cups sales soar 300% in a matter of weeks. Once little known Reece is is suddenly on the fast track to national success. Shortly after her, she's first KitKat ads air and turned the British bar into a national bestseller. Okay, Bob, look what I've got to Kit Kat two. What Two Kit Kat Chocolate bars. One for me and one for you. Hey, me. Sure, outside It's delicious chocolate inside its light and crispy and crunchy. Come on, it won't bite you. It feels like a turning point. After years of decline, her she's back. But then Washington throws a curveball. In August 1971 President Richard Nixon declares war on inflation by freezing all prices and wages. It's a nightmare for her. She ko bean prices a rising fast, and now the company can't raise prices to protect its profits. But Mars is in a better position. It's bars air, mainly new gooder cookie, so it uses less chocolate. Shortly after Nixon's announcement, Mahler called her. She's marketing team to his office to deliver shocking news. We cannot suffer a loss that's like taking money out of orphans mouths. Mahler's not kidding. Most of Hershey's stock is still owned by the orphan school Milton Hershey, founded in 1909 If her she doesn't deliver profits, the school misses out on millions in dividends. Mahler lets the message sink in and continues, so I'm ending all unnecessary expenditure. That means no more ads except for Kit Kat, because that's a contractual obligation. Marketing manager jacked out leaps to his feet. You can't do that. We're making breakthroughs. This will kill our momentum. But Mahler's not budging. It's a week later, and in Mars, headquarters in McLean, Virginia Forest Mars has gathered his top executives together. Her she has stopped advertising. This is our chance. I wanted all out attack. Give me the biggest ad push we've ever done. Get our products in the best spots in every store. I don't care about the cost. Do whatever it takes. Give them no quarter, motivated by potential bonuses worth up to 1/3 of their annual salary. Mars executives launch a blitzkrieg TV ads for Mars Candy bars fill the airwaves. Mars salespeople fan out across the nation, armed with in store display materials, knowing that 70% of candy bars air bought on impulse, they push stores into putting Mars products near cash registers. They also resort to underhand tactics. They win over store managers with free boxes of candy for their kids. They sneakily relocate Reese's peanut butter cups to remote corners of supermarkets and, um, accidentally knock Hershey bars off the shelves. Cost is huge, but Mars is a private company with no debt and deep pockets. There are no stockholders bleeding about quarterly results, and there aren't any bankers poking their noses into the finances, either. As Faras Forest is concerned, any losses now or an investment at his candy empires long term future with no ads or sales push from Hershey to stop its advance, Mars steamrolls over its rival, and in fall 1973 Mars shoves her she off its throne after 70 years on top her, she's no longer America's leading candy maker for forest It's a victory that's been 50 years in the making, but that doesn't make it any less sweet. Mars usually ignores the media, but not this time. It makes damn sure the newspapers know that Mars, not her. She is the new candy king. Her She is crumbling fast, and time's running out for it to fight back on the next episode, Mars battles Hershey on size and price. Hollywood offers her, she a helping hand, and M and M's gets a repeat from wondering. This is business wars. Hey, here's some exciting news to share with everyone on Monday.

S. It's a hot summer day in 1940 in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a tour guides just shown a group of tourists around the town's famous chocolate factory. Thank all of you for coming. I really hope you enjoyed yourselves. Have a wonderful day Now, as the rest of the group heads for the gift shop, one man approaches the guide with what seems like a complaint. I want to see the general manager of the company. Is there a problem? Sir? I imagine Mr Murray will be busy. Just tell him Forrest Mars is here. Half an hour later, Forest is in William Murray's office inside the windowless headquarters of the Hershey Chocolate Company. Murray's never met Forrest, but he certainly knows about him and is eager to finally talk with him. Forest inherited 1/3 of the Mars company when his father died in 1934 and every year the Snickers manufacturer buys huge amounts of Hershey's chocolate. A pleasure to meet you, Forrest. May I say how sorry I was when your father passed away? I must have missed you at the funeral. I wasn't there. Tell me what your son Bruce do now. Bruce. He's an investment banker on Wall Street. What a waste any fool can add and subtract. He'll learn nothing there really. Business is about product. Murray's not sure what to say to that, and before he can reply forest pools of scrunched up handkerchief from his pocket and opens it to reveal a bunch of small Candies, they look like tiny rainbow colored pebbles. They've been in my pocket since New Jersey dry one. Murray pops a red, went into his mouth and bites the candy shell cracks, releasing the milk chocolate. Inside, they're chocolate chocolates that don't melt forest smiles. It's time to really Murray in. I'm starting a new business selling these Candies. I'm telling you, this is the product. It'll be sold worldwide from Miami to Bombay. What I need now is chocolate from her she but I also need a business partner. I was thinking of your son. If Bruce comes in, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll name the company and the Candies. Eminem's for Murray and Mars. What do you think? Murray's flattered. He knows these non melting chocolates are something special, a product that could end the summer dip in chocolate sales. And he also likes the idea of a candy that bears his family name. Well, I think Bruce will jump at this opportunity, Forest grins. That is exactly what he came for. He's just returned from Europe, and he knows war is coming and war means supply shortages. With Bruce in his business, Forest can be sure Murray will do all he can to keep him supplied with chocolate. He knows Murray's got pals in Washington who can help M and M's when big military contracts. And once the war is over, Forest can push Bruce out and take back control. It's a trap, and Murray's just walked into it. Hook, lying and sinker. Business wars is brought to you by the capital one.

His business wars on the last episode, Frank Mars You Snickers and Milky Way to turn Mars into America's second biggest candy bar maker, earning millions for himself and his chocolate supplier Hershey. But Mars and her she's peaceful co existence is about to come under attack. Frank Mars is estranged son Forrest is back in America. Fresh from building a powerful candy empire in Britain, he's returned with Eminem's A new candy inspired by the British Sugar Shell Chocolates Smarties. And he's out to use them to break into the American market. This is Episode three. A candy coated prayer. It's April 1945 and just north of Munich, Germany, a squad of U. S soldiers is approaching a complex surrounded by electrified fences and barbed wire. The place is unnerve. Ingley quiet the camps. Nazi guards have already fled. The skies are empty of birds. The stench of death and decay hangs in the air. Clouds of flies buzz back and forth. The soldiers edge forward rifles raised, ready to fire, A young private from Alabama whispers to his nearest squad mate. You think this is one of them? Death camps don't know. Stay alert. The squad move forward through the gates and into the courtyard. As they do, the door to a large wooden building slowly starts to open. The soldiers spin around and trained their guns on the door. Slowly, a man emerges with his hands in the air. Privates, jaw drops. The man looks like a ghost. He's dressed in ragged prison stripes. His head is shaved and his body is a little more than loose skin over bone. Don't shoot! We're prisoners. As the man shuffles forward. Others emerge from the building like a procession of phantoms, emaciated men, women and Children who have seen and endured unimaginable horrors. As the crowd of prisoners filled the courtyard, the private notices a nine year old girl clinging to her grandfather's legs. Instinctively, he reaches into his ration pack in hands or a chocolate bar. The Hershey Chocolate Bar. Since the U. S joint World War, two Hershey chocolate bars have been standard issue for U. S troops fighting the Axis powers companies produced more than a 1,000,000,000 candy bars for service personnel and earn military awards for its contribution to the war effort. And now that the Third Reich is on its last legs, those chocolate bars air no longer just a taste of home for the troops. To the people of Europe, they're a symbol of liberation. Before the war, Hershey's Chocolate was virtually unknown in Europe, but now, without selling a single bar, her she has become famous across the continent. And that's left the Hershey chocolate company in a quandary. It's early, 1946 and in her she's windowless executive offices in Pennsylvania. Percy Staples is heading to a meeting with his top team. He walks down the corridor to the meeting room, pauses to take a deep breath and enters. The team are already there, sitting around a long conference table. Staples is Hershey's new boss, the man Milton Hershey choses his successor shortly before his death last October, but he's also an introverted guy who's uncomfortable. In large meetings like this, he mumbles a Hello takes his seat at the head of the table. Let's, um, start with a report on Europe, one of the team takes up the baton. He'd just gotten back from a fact finding trip there. The potential is huge. Our boys have been sharing their chocolate with Europeans, and now there's big demand for it. There's not much competition, either. The European companies air still recovering and subject to rationing. If we move fast, we could build a strong foothold. Before Nestle and Cadbury get back on their feet. The head of sales jumps in. Whoa there. We can't even meet demand at home. We need to focus on America. Staples watches quietly is the executives weigh the pros and cons. Then one of them asks the inevitable question. I wonder what Milton would do. The room goes silent. They've been asking themselves that question a lot lately. Trouble is, none of them has a clue how their visionary founder would move forward. As the question hangs unanswered, the executive turned to Staples waiting to hear what he thinks Staples sits deep in thought. His top concern at the moment is the price of Takeo Beans. Since wartime price controls ended, the prices tripled, hitting profits hard, and Staples doesn't want to do anything that endangers profits because those air what support the company's biggest stockholder, the Hershey's School for Orphan Boys. Um, Europe's too risky meeting demand here and maintaining profits is the priority. The call has been made. Her she is going to ignore its new status in Europe. It's a decision that will haunt the company for decades to come. But while her she's letting opportunity slip through its fingers, Forrest Mars isn't missing a trick. It's summer 1949 and Bruce Murray's in the restroom at M and M headquarters in Newark, New Jersey He's washing his hands when he spots a sheet of paper pen to the back of the door. It's the sales report he gave Forrest Mars this morning, and it's got the word failure scrawled across it in bright red ink. Since becoming forests business partner in 1940 Murray's been leading Eminem sales operation. Things went well. At first. He secured big military contracts for the non melting bite size Candies. All over the world. Service personnel were popping them into their mouths during downtime. But now the war's over. Those contracts are ending and sales are plunging. Forest has responded by making Murray's life a living hell. Murray's endured months of tongue lashings in front of his team. But this latest humiliation has pushed him over the edge. Murray rips. The sales were forced from the door and storms out of the restroom forests. At the far end of the open Plan office, Murray charges over shaking with rage and squares up to forest in front of the whole team. What the hell is this? I own 20% of this company. It's time you treated me with some respect. Forest narrows his eyes. Respect is something you earn. Bruce. When you stop being a failure, I'll stop treating you like one. Murray flips. He lunges it for us. As shocked employees watch to crash to the floor and start trading blows to managers rush over and pull them off. Murray shakes free storms out of the office forest, dabs the blood from his lip with a handkerchief and smiles. The next morning, Forest gives Murray and ultimatum Go on the road is a company salesman peddling candy to stores or quit Murray walks. There's no way he's going to spend his life schlepping around the country selling candy for forest. Shortly after leaving, Murray sells his stake in the business to forest for a $1,000,000. Forest may be pleased at having pushed Murray out, but he still needs to revive the tanking sales of Eminem's. He tries over and over to refresh the brand. He changes the packaging from cardboard tubes to small paper bags. He starts stamping tiny EMS on each candy to guard against copycats. He uses market research to figure out the ideal color mix for each bag of M and M's. And he heaps Maura and Maur pressure on his sales team to deliver results. But nothing seems to work. Stumped, he seeks outside help. It's 1954 and in Eminem's Newark headquarters, Rosser Reeves is about to present a plan toe Light, a fire under M and M sales. He typically wears a bow tie and is considered the advertising guru at the Madison Avenue ad agency. Ted Bates, the Eminem's executive team, is calling a meeting with Reeves in the hopes that he's got a killer idea for them. The good news for you is that our market research tell us kids love Eminem's. The bad news is parents, not kids, control the purse strings. You see, it's parents who decide what candy to buy, of course, and today's parents didn't grow up eating M and M's. You need a campaign with a message that wins over parents. So what do you suggest? We tell parents that with Eminem's, they no longer need to worry about their kids smearing chocolate all over the furniture. Our suggested slogan is Melts in your mouth, Not in your hand. The Eminem's team break into smiles. The slogan sounds perfect. Encouraged, Reeves continues. We also think TV ads that combine the message for parents with animated characters aimed at kids will work best. We're thinking of two characters, actually, one that's a plain chocolate, Eminem and another based on the new peanut M and M's. You're about to launch Forest leaps to his feet with a big smile on his face. Yes, yes, this is exactly what we need. Let's do it. Soon after three campaign hits the nation's TV screens, just as peanut M and M's arrive in stores. I'm one of the eminent chop with can solid milk chocolate. It's fine and a colorful shit show, and I'm a delicious peanut. But look what happened for me. First time ranged in cream milk chop, then covered with a crisp in sugar shell. Look with M on each feet. Try Eminem's Chocolate Candies with peanuts or playing. Remember Eminem's Milk Chocolate melts in your mouth, Not in your hand. The campaign's impact is immediate. After a years of limping along, demand for Eminem's soars. By 1956 it's become one of America's favorite Candies, with sales of more than $40 million a year. And that's enough to make her she take notice. Hershey's normally blase about the competition, preferring to treat most rivals as potential bulk buyers of its chocolate. But with M and M's raking in millions her, she fears it's missing a trick by not making a similar candy of its own. In April 1956 her she launches its own answer to Eminem's. They're called her, she adds, and their football shaped chocolates coated in sugar shells. But her, she adds, struggle. The first problem is that the Hershey Chocolate Company doesn't advertise. It never has. From the day he started the company, Milton Hershey refused to run ads for his products, preferring to focus on in store displays and posters, but with no TV radio or print ads for her, she adds. Few consumers even know they exist. Then the company discovers that the sugar shells of its new oval shaped Candies turn rock hard. After a few months on the shelves, and with her, she unable to stop M and M's Momentum Forests already eyeing his next target, a target he's wanted to get his hands on for almost 30 years. His dad's old company, Mars. If you've ever had to hire for your business, you know it can be a slow process.

And in Pennsylvania, Hershey's chief lawyer steps into the office of CEO Samuel Hinkle. Boss, I've just gotten a tip. The Reese Candy companies looking to sell the British American Tobacco. Hinkle's shock and he should be. Hershey and Reese go way back. Harry Reese worked for her she before founding his company in 1923. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups factory is just a few blocks away, and it uses Hershey chocolate Her. She even helped re survived the Depression and World War Two. What? Well, why haven't they come to us? We should be first on their list if they want to sell, no matter. Get me a meeting with him right away. the next day Hinkle meets Reese is manager George McLean at the offices of a law firm? George Word is Reese is up for sale. McLean's nods. It is. The Reese family feels the business has gotten too big for them to handle, so they're looking for a buyer. You interested Hinkle? Most definitely is. Reese is only product. Reese's peanut butter cups are almost unknown outside the mid Atlantic States, but he thinks they've got untapped potential there, already outselling Hershey's almond bars in some parts of Pennsylvania. And who knows how much better Reese's peanut butter cups could do if they were so coast to coast? There's another reason, too, thanks to Mars, chocolate coated Candies like Snickers and Milky Way are the fastest growing segment in the candy business. Buying Reese would get her, she into that category and allow it to challenge Mars head on. Hinkle clasps his hands together. I am interested, very interested. I also think you'll be better off with us than with British American tobacco. I mean, we've got similar values. We already worked together, and you already use our chocolate. So tell me, what's it gonna take to get the family to sell to us, please leans back into his chair. I hear you, But what the family wants is a good price. That's the bottom line. What's your offer? $23 million. McLean's smiles. That's more than the Reese is expected. That's a fair offer. Let me talk to the family. The family says yes. For Hinkle, buying Reese is a relief. Her She hasn't created a breakout candy since the war, but now it's got a product that can help it counter rivals like Mars and M and M's. But Hinkle's not the only man making deals. It's 1964 and Forrest Mars is visiting his half sister, Patricia, at her large home in La Jolla, California They may share the same father, but they couldn't be more different. While Forest is all business, Patricia prefer spending the big dividend she gets from her stake in Mars. Or at least she did until she got brain cancer. Now she just wants to secure her Children's future before she dies. Patricia knows Forest hasn't come to see her out of concern. She knows him better than that. He's been after her 41% stake in Mars ever since he returned to the U. S. In 1940. Let me guess. You want my stock? Yes, but listen, Mars is in trouble. Sales have dropped from 50 to 41 million in four years. The company's cutting back on quality, and that's the fastest way to kill a business. You've seen a Snickers recently. It's a joke. The chocolate so thin I can see through it. Our father made the best damn candy bars in the business, and they're ruining them. If this continues, Mars will go bust. Patricia knows forests right. She also knows that for all his flaws, he's the company's best hope. Okay, I give you my shares, but on three conditions. One, you keep the Mars name. I want our family name to endure, too. I get nonvoting stock that pays a guaranteed income so my Children can inherit it. Finally, my husband stays CEO. Agreed. Patricia. Thank you. Thank you. No, It's December 1964 and in Chicago. Mars is top executives, air waiting nervously in the board room. Just minutes ago, they learned that Forest is now the company's sole owner and that he's just fired Patricia's husband, and now he wants to see them. The 60 year old forest bursts in wispy gray hair flapping. He heads to the front of the room in terms to the team. You know, I'm a religious man. The executives air puzzled, and they never thought of forest having any God other than the almighty dollar. Suddenly forest drops to his knees and clasps his hands together in prayer. Oh, Lord, I pray. I pray for Milky Way. I pray for snickers. The executives stair open mouth that the bizarre sight and I pray for Three Musketeers. Mom man forest rises to his feet. The executives look at each other, unsure how to respond. They don't have to think long. These products will now consume your lives. Your every waking moment will be dedicated to them. They are the products consumers by. They are the products that make the profits, and profit is our sole objective. Now that sounds more like Forest Salter. In the weeks that follow, a tornado of change sweeps through Mars, office walls are knocked down expensive carpets thorne up, an oak paneled walls stripped. The company's art collection and corporate helicopter are sold. Managers who once had private officers find themselves on open plan floors surrounded by their reports, Memos Air band so that all communication is done face to face or by phone. Employees are prohibited from having personal items of their desks. Salaries are increased 30% and linked to team performance. A generous bonus scheme is introduced and 12 hour days become the norm. Snickers, Milky Way and three muster tears are restored to their original sizes. And to ensure quality, every factory worker is empowered to halt production if they see anything amiss. By the time forests finished. Mars is a company reborn. It's now a focused, driven Army with one mission. Make her she history. On the next episode, Mars launches a surprise attack her, she tries advertising, and the supermarkets become a battle front from wondering. This is business wars.

The cops arrested the 19 year old cigarette salesman last night, his crime plastering posters for camel cigarettes on every downtown wall and street sign he could find without permission. He sits up when he hears footsteps approaching a guard, pulls out a set of keys and pushes open the door of his cell. Your dad posted bail for your kid. Get out, Get out for a spots. His father the moment he leaves the cell. He hasn't seen his father in years, but the resemblance is uncanny. They're both stocky guys with prominent Roman noses, thin lips and dark piercing eyes. Hello, son, I want something to eat. They had for a nearby diner and sit in awkward silence. Forest stares at his father warily while sucking chocolate malt through a straw forests.

What do you suggest I make forests? Not sure. He hasn't thought that far ahead. He stares into his mauled Um Ah, yeah. Why don't you turn this chocolate malted to a candy bar.

On the last episode, Milton Hershey introduced Milk Chocolate Toe America, built the town of Hershey and donated his riches to a school for orphans. But now it's the 19 twenties, and a new candy empire is about to reach for the stars. This is Episode two blast off. It's 1928 and Frank Mars is at the headquarters of America's top chocolate maker, Hershey. He's come to Pennsylvania to make a deal, a deal. His company's future depends on Frank's been doing well since creating Milky Way sales are growing, and he's changed the company name from tomorrow Bar to Mars. But now this 40 something candy man's betting the house on Milky Way. He's spending half a $1,000,000 building an ultra modern factory in Chicago. He hopes the investment will send Milky Way sale sky high. But for the plan to work, he needs help from her. She's general manager William Murray. Murray's a tall, broad shouldered executive with snow white hair, and he's the business brawn to Milton Hershey's business brain. While her she delivers the vision, Murray manages the day to day operations that turn ideas into profit. Murray welcomes Frank with a hearty slap on the back before sitting down behind his huge desk. So Mr Mars, how can I be of service? Frank tells Murray about his new plant. My new factory will increase production five, maybe six fold, and that means I need chocolate and plenty of it Murray grins her. She already sells chocolate coating to confectioners who lack the know how our money to do it themselves. Her. She only regards companies that make solid chocolate bars as rivals. Everyone else is a potential customer. Okay, what quantities do you have in mind? Millions of pounds a month, Murray almost falls off his chair. It's enough to double the size of Hershey's chocolate supply business, but Frank's not finished, but I need the chocolate on credit. All my money's tied up in building the new plant. Murray Spaceballs Frank's gone bust so many times every supplier in the business demands he paid cash up front. Uh, what is it you're making again? Frank opens his briefcase and hands Murray a Milky Way. Murray pulls back the beige paper wrapper. It takes a bite. The sweet hit of fluffy new ggot sticky caramel and milk chocolate explodes on his tongue. Wow, that's a fine candy bar, Mr Mars, and I reckon it will sell. Yeah, you've got your credit. The to smile and shake hands. They're both looking forward to a long and profitable alliance. It's 1929 and the Chicago suburb of Oak Park. The new Mars factory is up and running from the outside, This Spanish colonial building, with its stained glass windows and manicured lawn, looks like a country club. But inside, it's state of the art industry. The interior is light, airy and temperature controlled. The production lines are equipped with the latest technology that smothers new but in chocolate and automated machines that can wrap more than 2000 Milky Ways an hour. And thanks to Frank's obsession with cleanliness, the place is spotless. Every surface shines, but there's one feature the factory workers could do without Frank's son, Forrest Mars. Officially, Forest Job is to buy eggs, sugar and other supplies, but he swaggers about as if Mars is his company. Today, he's prowling around the caramel machines as bars of Newgate on their way to becoming Milky Ways. Rattle passed. He scans the conveyor belt like a hawk, searching for the slightest imperfection. Suddenly, he snatches a misshapen bar from the belt and flings it at the worker charged with catching defects. The sticky bar of Newgate splats against the back of the workers head. What that the worker turns to see forest marching towards him. Face red eyes, narrowed. You imbecile. You're supposed to spot mistakes, not be the mistake. I should fire you. Shortly after Frank summons his son to his office forest, I need you to control your temper. You see a problem. Tell me I'll handle it. You stick with what I hired you to do. Forest responds by changing the subject. You know, I've been thinking. We need to get into Canada before the British companies like Cadbury and Roundtree get embedded there. That's not the topic, but But listen, I've only just built this plant. Okay? Canada can wait. No, you need to keep pushing. Keep building. That's how you win, Frank sighs. His son's attitude grates on him, but what can he do? He can't fire him. He already feels guilty. Enough about abandoning Forest is a kid. But while Mars is using its new plant to join the majors, Milton Hershey's thinking even bigger. It's a hot summer night in 1929 and the 71 year old chocolate magnet is sitting on the porch of his hilltop mansion in Hershey, Pennsylvania. With him is Wall Street bankers Stanley Russell, nursing a scotch and soda as the pair stares at the stars. Russell gets to business. He wants her she to join what he believes will be the greatest achievement of his career. Ah, mega merger of Hershey, Kraft, Heinz and Colgate Palmolive. Mr. Hershey, the Hershey chocolate Company would be the very heart of the conglomerate I want to create. And with your support, I believe the other companies will sign up her. She sips his drink. He's been weighing Russell's proposal for months. It'll cost his chocolate empire its independence, but well, but the rewards could be huge. Her she will become the basis of one of America's biggest companies. He also believes the money he's given his school for orphans will be safer in a business that makes more than just chocolate. Okay, Mr Russell, I'm game. What's next? Rustled smiles him in his bank. You're gonna make tens of millions from this deal. Well, sir, I pay you for a six month option to execute the deal. That should give me time to get the other companies on board. In the months that follow, Russell races to sign up companies to join the conglomerate. But just weeks away from sealing the deal, disaster strikes on October 24th 1929. The stock market crashes, the economy goes into meltdown, banks start going bust, thousands of companies go under. Millions find themselves out of work. And Russell's bid to absorb her she into a multimillion dollar conglomerate is toast. But her she isn't bothered. He's more worried about what the Great Depression will do to his chocolate town. Is the economic fallout worsens? He decides he has to do something to defend it. He bars the company from laying off workers, cutting wages or curtailing production. To stoke the economy of the town of Hershey, He orders a massive construction program to build a sports arena. Ah, luxury hotel and a state of the art office block. Even as his company's revenues plunge, Chocolate Tycoon holds the line, shielding his town from the worst ravages of the Great Depression. But Milton Hershey is not alone in weathering the economic storm. Frank Mars is also bucking the trend. Frank's discovering that Milky Way is a Depression proof product. It's chunky. Size makes people think each five cent bars better value. That thin bar of chocolate, even though it's mainly cheap. New good. Frank's company, Mars, is also scoring big with two new products. In 1930 Frank creates a nougat bar topped with caramel and peanuts. He calls it snickers after one of his horses, and when he starts coating it with chocolate in 1932 sales skyrocket. That same year, he launches Three Musketeers and, after some tinkering, turns it into a caramel free version of the Milky Way. The resilience, sales, new products and plenty of advertising turns Mars into America's number two candy bar maker. After her, she not that her she feels threatened. After all, Mars is a valued customer. It buys all of its candy bars. Chocolate coating from Hershey Mars is success. His Hershey's success, too. And with the big bucks rolling in, Frank gets to splashes cash on horses, ranches, airplanes and luxury cars. It all be great if it wasn't for one persistent problem. His 28 year old son, Forrest. It's fall 1932 and Forests just barged into his father's office in Chicago. He doesn't ask if it's a good time. He just sits down and makes a demand. I want 1/3 of the company. Sorry, I want 1/3 of the business. I deserve it. Given all I've done here, Frank snaps, he's put up with forests, arrogance and outbursts for long enough. That's not happening. In fact, this company isn't big enough for both of us. Hell, I'm not even sure this country is big enough. I want you gone. Forest fields rage boiling up within him. The way he sees it, his dad is casting him aside yet again. Fine. You could take your damn company and stick it up your ass. Frank ignores the insult. Forrest. Here's my offer. I'll give you $50,000 the rights to Mars products in Europe. All right, go there, Start your business. Stay out of my way. Deal. Deal. It's a week later in Forest, Mars stands on the deck of a steamer heading to Europe. As the Statue of Liberty disappears over the horizon, he starts thinking about his new business, about how he's going to build an empire that dwarfs Mars and how once he's done it, he's going to come back and rub it in everyone's face.

Shift is underway at Nestle is Chocolate Works in Vevey, Switzerland, and that means the plant supervisor can get on with today's big task. Hiring new workers. He's gazing out his office window at the snowcapped mountains lining Lake Geneva. When the next candidate enters, the supervisor turns to see a young, stocky guy with prematurely receding hair. Sure, come over use Apple booth. Candidate looks confused. Jim Pel Forrest Mars Supervisor raises an eyebrow. Your English American, huh? Why are you in switching it? Why do you want to work here? Forests already got his story ready. I want to live in the Alps, and I thought working in a chocolate factory would be fun. Have you worked in a chocolate factory before now? But I learned fast. I'm off the floors if I must. Forest gets the job. He spends the next few weeks learning everything he can about nest Lee's operations and how it makes milk chocolate. Then, after gleaning all the insights he can, he quits. He's going to start his own candy empire. In Britain, it's August 1933. And in a one room factory in the industrial town of Slough, just west of London, Forest is preparing for war. Compared to Britain's Chocolate King's Cadbury and Roundtree Forests, Venture is puny. It's called food manufacturers. It's got just four employees, and it depends on Cadbury for its chocolate. But Forests convinced his new candy bar will prove a winner. He calls it the Mars Bar, and it's a slightly sweeter version of his dad's Milky Way. Forest pushes the Mars bar hard from the moment it goes into production. He runs eye catching newspaper ads, Badgers stores until they stock his candy bars and insurers that stores never run out of them. The relentless sales and marketing push pays off fast food manufacturers sells two million Mars bars in its first year. Soon after Forest launches his own version of Milky Way. And just like his dad's Three Musketeers bar, it's chocolate flavored Newgate wrapped in milk chocolate. As his business grows, Forest forges a unique management style, one that's far removed from the cozy paternalism of Hershey. He stamps out traditional hierarchies by giving all workers the title of associates. He encourages transparency with open plan offices to motivate his associates. He pays them three times the going rate. He also creates a generous and transparent bonus scheme that insurers workers know exactly what their team must do. Tow land. A sweet end of year lump sum. To encourage long term thinking. He sets targets for the return on total assets. That means managers can't just look a revenues. They have to factor in how well they're deploying. The company's resource is the target encourages managers to maximize efficiency rather than chase short term profits and to ensure they follow his commandments to the letter. Forest uses his volcanic temper to keep his people on edge, especially when it comes to what he sees as the bedrock of good business product quality. It's 1935 and Forrest Mars is on the warpath in the Slough offices of food manufacturers. He's just spotted a poorly wrapped Mars bar in a local candy store. Bring the latest boxes of Mars bars to the meeting room. Now, as managers carry the cardboard boxes into the glass walled room, the rest of the office watched nervously from their desks. Forest rips open one of the boxes and starts rummaging through it. Suddenly he stops and slowly raises a Mars bar into the air. The rapper is slightly misaligned. The manager's gope. This this is unacceptable. Without warning, Forest hurls the defective bar, crossed the room. If whizzes past one of the managers heads and thumps into the glass wall. The associates outside the room jump in their seats. Forest dives back into the box. He pulls out Maur incorrectly wrapped Mars bars and hurls them at the room. Managers duck and dive to avoid the chocolate coated missiles. Finally, Forest tips the entire contents of the bucks right there onto the floor. This shipment is ruined, destroyed a lot, and if it happens again, you're all fired. After the outburst, the managers returned to work, determined to make things right. The gun used to forests explosive temper, and they're also on board with his perfectionist demands, not least because it's a winning formula. Two years ago, food manufacturers didn't exist. Now it's Britain's third biggest candy bar maker, and as food manufacturers thrives, they do, too. Thanks to forests generous bonuses. The UK is number two. Roundtree responds to the threat by launching a spate of new and novel products in 1935. It scores big with Kit Kat four way for fingers covered in milk chocolate. Two years later, it comes up with Smarties, a cardboard tube filled with small chocolate discs in colorful sugar shells. Smarties is another hit, and it solves one of the biggest problems in the chocolate business. The summer. Drop off with air conditioned store. Still rare. Sales of chocolate plunge during the summer heat is candy bars melt on the shelves. But with their crispy candy shells, Smarties can withstand the soaring temperatures. And that convinces Roundtree that Smarties could be the candy that finally helps it break into the U. S. But before the company can bring Smarties to America, a shadow falls over Europe. Nazi Germany invades Poland, plunging Europe into war, enforcing Roundtree to put its US plans on ice. The war also changes forest strategy. After reading that the British government is about to impose extra taxes on foreign residents, he decides to head home. But he's not returning empty handed. He's coming back with a big idea. He's going to make his own version of Smarties and use them to conquer the American chocolate business on the next episode, Forrest Mars lays a trap War breaks out in the Mars board room, and opportunity knocks for her.

Last winter, he fell for another of his father's hare brained schemes. This time, it wasn't making fancy display cabinets work prospecting for silver in Colorado but selling cough drops to New Yorkers eager to help his father find success her. She borrowed $10,000 to buy the equipment to make the drops, but they didn't sell. Now he's back, selling candy and every sale cows. He retrieves a small basket from the back of his wagon and enters the store. Good afternoon, sir. No, you the storekeeper. I am Pleasure to meet you. I'm Milton Hershey. I'm a confectioner. May I show you my Candies. Storekeeper nods her. She puts his basket on the counter. Inside are bright yellow lemon drops, warm brown caramel cubes, grass green lollipops and shiny candied fruits. The storekeeper reaches for a caramel, but then there's a burst of noise from outside a barrage of exploding firecrackers. Hershey's horse. When he's in fear her, She races outside and sees his terrified horse galloping down the street. His wagon is careening behind it, tossing his precious Candies All around and across the street. Kids who lit the fire crackers under his horse are doubled over in laughter. Her, she sinks to his knees and despair. It's the last straw. New York's beaten. It's chewed him up and spat him out like gum. It's time for her she to go crawling back to his mother's family cap in hand to start all over again. Business wars is brought to you by the capital one.

Yeah, in our new Siri's Hershey versus Mars were unwrapping the sweetest business rivalry of all but battle to dominate the world's $140 billion chocolate market. Today's mega industry is unrecognizable from the chocolate business of 18 86. Back then, chocolate wasn't something you ate. It was something you drank, but that's all about to change. This is Episode one Chocolate Town Summer 18 86. Rural Pennsylvania. It's dinnertime in Milton. Hershey is in the large farm house owned by his mother's family around the wooden dining table, Er's and and uncles, and they're waiting to hear what he's going to do next. Her She's just returned from New York. He's broke and dodging debt collectors. But despite the sting of yet another failed business, he's determined to stay positive. I'm putting New York behind me. I'm starting a new business. Aunt Maddie sits opposite her. She she's wearing a black ankle length dress in a white bonnet, and she looks concerned. I pray you're good for nothing. Father isn't involved. No, no, I've learned my lesson. I'll be keeping him out of my business from now on at Matty's heard that before, but this time her she means it her. She sips his water and continues, I'm going to make caramels. But not just any caramels. When I was in Denver with Father, a confectioner taught me how to make caramels with milk instead of Para Finn. Have you tried milk caramels? The uncle's shake their heads. They're so much better than normal caramels. They're smooth and chewy, and they don't stick in your teeth, and they stay fresh for months rather than spoiling after a few days. You know no one makes milk caramels in the East, but I know people here will love him. There's just of one thing, and Maddie steels herself. She knows what's coming. I just need a little money. Not much, just a little to get me back on my feet. A few $100 her. She's optimistic his aunt and uncle's will give him the money. As owners of the area's largest farm, they're well off, and they have always helped him before the family glances at each other. Then Aunt Matty turns to her. She know Milton, not this time her. She blinks in shock Suddenly he realizes how he looks to them now, just like his old man, a dreamer always chasing the big break in, leaving a trail of failure in his wake for the first time in his life. Her she is on his own. He's going to have to start over from nothing. Over the next year, Hershey knuckles down. He rents a small room in a warehouse in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and forms the Lancaster Caramel Company. He walks the streets selling his caramels to the town, spoke from a basket. He uses the profits to buy a push cart, and then he uses the extra sales to rent a larger space insider red brick factory. As he toils, relations with his family saw Aunt Matty at his mother help wrap his caramels and tissue paper. Then Aunt Maddie guarantees a 90 day bank loan so her she can buy more equipment to increase production. But her? She's overstretched himself. His caramels are popular, but Lancaster's a small town. There's not enough demand to deliver the profits. Her she needs to cover his loan. As the repayment deadline approaches her, she faces ruined again. It's 18 87 and in Lancaster Pennsylvania. Her she's cooking caramels. Inside his rented factory space, he leans over a large copper pot, stirring a bubbling mix of sugar and milk with a wooden paddle. He pauses to wipe the sweat from his brow. And here's knocking at the door. He opens the door to find a well dressed Englishman in a top hat. Good morning, sir. Are you Milton Hershey? That's me. Most wonderful. I am an importer of goods to Britain, scouting for products. I tried your caramels yesterday, and I was most impressed. Tell me, how long do they keep? Not sure. Exactly Longer than most, because I make the move mill several months, at least. I guess several months. Well, that's welcome news. Welcome news. Indeed. I would like to order $2400 worth. Now. If the first order is a success, larger orders will follow. I'll send a check once the order reaches London. Hershey's jaw drops. He's been selling small bags of caramels for one set, but with this one massive order for tens of thousands of caramels, he can clear his debts and start expanding beyond Lancaster. Her she accepts the order. Then he persuades the bank to extend at increase his loan. He buys more supplies, hires extra helpers and works around the clock to ship the caramels toa London on time, and then he waits. But as the days pass, doubts creep into his mind. What if the importer was a con man? What if he takes the caramels and doesn't pay? Then one morning, the mailman delivers a letter from England. Her she tears it open. Inside is the check. He's been waiting for her. She leaps into the air. Yes, he dances around the factory and delight before racing out the door. He runs toward the bank, ready to cash the check and clear his debt. He's halfway there before he realizes he's still wearing his dirty, caramel smudged apron. After that, there's no stopping her. She he expands his product range. He makes square circular and bean shaped caramels. He sells expensive whole milk caramels that cost a dollar a box and cheap skim milk caramels that sell for 10 a penny. He flavors caramels with cocoa powder and almonds and creates black caramels color with soot. He distributes his confections across the country and exports them as far away as Japan and Australia. He builds factories in Pennsylvania and Illinois within five years. He's employing more than 700 workers by the early 18 nineties. Her She is one of the richest men in Pennsylvania and the biggest caramel manufacturer in America. It's 18 93 and Hershey and his cousin are visiting the spectacular Chicago World's Fair. They're in the machinery hall, checking out the steam engines that power the entire fair, along with the latest locomotives. But then her. She notices something, something unexpected, a sweet fragrance cutting through the stench of oil that dominates the hall. A rich, earthy, exotic scent with just a hint of fruitiness. It's chocolate her. She follows his nose to the source, a fully functioning chocolate bar production line set up by a German equipment manufacturer. People have been drinking chocolate for centuries, but chocolate you can eat is still a novelty. First Chocolate Bar debuted in England in 18 47 but they remain an expensive luxury rarely seen outside Europe. Her she is Austria. He watches as the workers turn raw Takeo beans into blocks of dark chocolate ko beans, air loaded in roasting ovens before being cooled and hauled. Then their ground and pressed into a gritty paste. It's poured into a giant, seashell shaped mixer Inside the mixer, marble rollers knead the paste for hours, massaging it into smooth brown liquid chocolate. After adding sugar, vanilla and fatty cocoa butter chocolate is poured into molds. Once cooled, dark slabs of ready to eat chocolate emerge her. She bites into a freshly made chocolate bar. It's smooth, bittersweet and absolutely delicious. He closes his eyes in Bliss is the chocolate melts on his tongue. He opens his eyes and turns to his cousin. Caramels, just a fad. People only eat them is an occasional treat. But chocolate people will eat chocolate every day. Fired up by the potential appeal of chocolate bars and the chance to rekindle his love of creating new confections. Her, she decides he's going to make chocolate before leaving. He buys the display equipment and arranges to have it shipped to his Lancaster factory. The moment the fair ends by February 18 94 Hershey's equipment is up and running. He founds the Hershey Chocolate Company and starts making dark chocolates shaped like gems, flowers and cigarettes. His chocolates make far less money than his caramels but her. She doesn't care. It's 18 98 and her She's in a London club with a British importer of his caramels. Drinks in hand, the two men sink into expensive leather armchairs. Her She likes a cigar and asks the importer a question. You've ordered fewer caramels recently. Why is that? The importer puts down his glass of brandy. Tastes are changing. Milton. People here are losing interest in caramels. They want the new milk chocolate bars instead, especially now that they're being made in Britain. Her she raises an eyebrow. I thought only the Swiss knew howto make milk chocolate. Not anymore. The big chocolate makers here have figured out how Nestle does it. Cadbury started producing milk chocolate bars just last year. Her She sits up at the mention of Cadbury. The British chocolate giant's been in the news recently. It's owned by a Quaker family that wants to improve its workers lives by helping them escape the slums. To do that, Cadbury is building a model factory and village near Birmingham. Ah, utopian village called Born Ville. Her. She's intrigued. Say, what do you think of Cadbury's born ville project? Difficult to say. I have to applauded morally, that Birmingham slums or an appalling place jury's still out on whether it's good business, though I figure they give their workers cheap loans to buy houses, and half days on Saturdays seems excessive. Well, I think it's a wonderful idea. I hope it works anyhow. Back to my caramels. What do you think I should do if sales keep dropping? I can't stay afloat forever. Am I correct to think that no one makes her cells milk chocolate in America? Her? She nods. Uh, in that case, I'd say become the man who brings milk chocolate to America. It's early 1900 inside his expensively decorated mansion in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, her she is playing pool with a buddy. As his peacocks struck past the tall window overlooking the yard, her, she chalks his cue and delivers some shocking news. I'm selling the Lancaster Caramel Company. Hershey's friend freezes mid shot. Really, Why, yes, I'm going to use the money to build the biggest chocolate works this country has ever seen. It will make milk chocolate bars that will sell for a nickel and stores. The friend takes his shot and sinks a ball, a milk chocolate bar that only costs a nickel. And that'll be something. As the friend searches for his next shot, her she drops another bombshell. I'm also going to build a town for my workers, you know, like born villain England, but bigger. Out in Dauphin County, Hershey's buddy puts down his cue. Building a town is crazy enough, but building it in rural Pennsylvania is even crazier. Dauphin County Milton. There's nothing. There's just hills and cows. Have you lost your mind? Maybe. But thing is, I don't care about money. Look at me. I have more than I need. I want to do something momentous. What do you think? Seriously, what I think Milton is a court needs to appoint you a guardian. I mean, do you even know howto make milk chocolate? No, but how hard can it be? Her. She is about to find out, and he'll soon learn that it's way, way harder than he ever imagined.

He's trying to make milk chocolate, and the latest batch is ready. Tentatively, Hershey and his small team removed the bars from the molds, break off chunks and popped them into their mouths. Got one worker spits his piece into his hand, the chocolates awful. It tastes like spoiled milk and burnt sugar, and it has the texture of grit. Her. She looks at his deflated team. Let's call it a night and try again tomorrow. It's been two months since her she sold his caramel empire for a 1,000,000 bucks, roughly $30 million in today's money. He's been trying to make milk chocolate ever since, but it's proving an uphill struggle because milk and chocolate are just like oil and water. The water in the milk refuses to mix with chocolates fatty cocoa butter. Instead, the cocoa butter forms oily beads that float in the milk. And even when Hershey and his team managed to force these unruly ingredients together, their results air crumbly bars that turn rancid within two days before his plan to work her, she needs to mass produce milk chocolate that stays fresh for months so it can be shipped nationwide. He knows it's possible, but the European companies that know the secret aren't telling so her. She must work it out through trial and ever nights of experiments become weeks, then months and then years. It's summer 1903 and in Dauphin County, construction is underway on the 1200 acres her she bought for his chocolate town. Builders lay the foundations of his giant chocolate factory workers with shovels clear paths that will become streets in the distance. Dynamite explosions blast open entire hills to provide limestone for the factory walls. And just across Spring Creek, bricklayers are building the first houses. In the months that follow the town of her. She takes shape. Unpaved paths become streets lined with spacious, two story brick homes that have indoor plumbing and electricity. Railroad tracks sprout from the factory and snake through the hills to connect the town to the wider rail network. The red brick factories to towering smokestacks rise from the ground, but her. She's still struggling to make milk chocolate, and at this rate he'll have built a factory and a town for nothing. It's fall 1903 and her. She's alone in his top secret barn in Dauphin County, waiting for John Schmall back. Small back is one of her. She's most experienced factory workers, and the increasingly desperate founder hopes he can help. Who's there? Smile. But Mr Hershey, Who else would it be her. She opens the door, sticks his head out and glances side to side before pulling Schmalbach inside and bolting the door. The pair worked through the night after several failed batches. Schmalbach has an idea, Mr Hershey, let me try something as her she watches. Hopefully, Schmalbach slowly evaporates milk in a copper kettle over low heat. After a few hours, they opened the kettle. This time the condensed milk iss silky smooth. Encouraged, they used the condensed milk to make another batch of chocolate. After cooling the chocolate, they nervously take a bite. This time, the chocolate tastes smooth and creamy. Hershey's eyes widen my word. This is wonderful. The pair repeats the process. They want to make sure it wasn't a fluke to their relief. Second batch is Justus Good? By Dawn her. She's got his recipe compared to European milk chocolate, it has a slight hint of sour nous, but her she doesn't care. It's distinctive, and it's his. And since most Americans haven't eaten European chocolate, his customers won't care, either. By 1905 Hershey's five cent milk chocolate bars are on sale in grocery and candy stores across America, and they're selling fast. Thanks to her, she milk. Chocolate bars are no longer in exotic European luxury. Now, almost every American can afford one. New hit. Products follow in 1907 Her She introduces kisses, bite sized milk, chocolate drops, hand wrapped in silver foil. A year later, he creates Hershey almond bars by mixing almonds and chocolate. A sales boom her. She lavishes his profits on the town. He builds a leisure park and a zoo. He and his wife open a residential school for Orphan Boys. By 1910. Hershey is America's undisputed chocolate king, but money doesn't buy everything. It's March 1915 and in a Philadelphia hotel her she kneels at his wife's bedside. Kitty is only 43 but her health has been declining for years, even though her she has spent a fortune consulting the best doctors these days. Kid, he can't walk or lift a book. Now she's got pneumonia. Her she leans closer to his wife. Can I get you anything, darling? Kitty smiles at her gray haired husband. Champagne Hershey grands. That's the fun loving Irish woman. He knows he heads to the bar. But as he returns to the room with a glass of champagne, he sees Kitty's nurse standing at the door, and there are tears in her eyes. Kitty's death shatters her. She, at 57 he steps back from his company and spends his days thinking of how to honor his wife's memory. His thoughts soon turned to the school for orphans. They found it after it became clear they couldn't have Children. It's November 1918 and her she's in his attorney's office. Mr. Hershey, are you sure about this. There's no going back. Once you sign, I'm sure I have no Children, So I'm making the Orphan Boys of America my heirs. And with that her. She signs the papers signing over his entire fortune to the orphan school. He and Kitty founded $60 million worth of Hershey chocolate company stock. That's roughly $1 billion today. Now the school owns America's biggest chocolate company, Ah company, so dominant it seems unbeatable. But the carefree years when her she faced little competition are about to end. That's because a confectioner named Frank Mars is starting a new business that's going to take the candy business by storm. But when Hershey and Mars first meet, it won't be as enemies but his friends. On the next episode, her she battles the Great Depression.

You heard about 33 patients in Texas who went in for surgery and had their lives forever changed by an incompetent doctor. Hosting reporter Laura Bill broke that story wide open, and now she's covering another very important story. Stem cell therapy and a bad batch that gave a group of patients disastrous results. Bad Batch will investigate the multimillion dollar under regulated industry of stem cell therapy were corporate greed and patient desperation come together?

In the fall of 2015 John Coastal, Sharon's mother, called him with some worrying news. Well, you know my mom, my mom calls me with the you know, she text me with these things like, you know, this what happened me today and not feeling well. And so she sent me pictures of her hand and she said, You know, Bert, today I burnt my hand and it's really bad. His mom, Lois, said she'd been helping a step dad. Well, the gate on their farm in Wisconsin and she was holding that gate and he dropped the glove. The glove fell into a pile of leaves and to not start the leaves on fire. He wanted to hold the torch up and away from the ground as he leaned over to pick up the glove. The tip of the blue flame had grazed. The top of Lois's hand tortures 2700 degrees. So it doesn't take but just a flash in proximity, and it's gonna burn it almost to the bone should washed and bandage the wound herself. At the time, she didn't sound overly concerned, and at first John wasn't worried either. He grew up on the farm, and he knows that injuries air just a part of life in the country. But over the next few days, Lois started texting her son. The photos. I mean, I still have the entire series of pictures. It's crazy, and the pictures literally went from it. Looked like wrinkled skin to the skin. Got blisters to the skin, came off Uh, until you know it was really looking like the 1st 345 layers of skin had come off. If you've ever suffered a severe burn on your hand or anywhere else, it's painful, a constant, searing pain that won't go away Finally, his mom went to see a burn specialist, and that burned doctor at Madison was saying, You're probably going to lose his hand because as bad as it is, there is no way you're gonna be able to keep infection out of there. Then John had an idea. A few years earlier, Jonah tried a new kind of treatment to help heal a knee injury, and it worked great for him, so he thought maybe Lois should try it for her hand. She was willing to give it a go. You get so desperate you'll do anything at any cost to try to live. John flew his mother to California. He brought her to a clinic, where she was hooked up to an I V and given stem cells. And just like that, her hands started to get better. And not just her hand. She'd had arthritis for years, but after the stem cell treatments that started to get better. To stop taking medication, she stopped taking pain pills. He was able to walk. She had a garden. She had, you know, watch the grandkids. She can answer her phone and type on a smartphone. Wait was like changing for me, Really lucky. Aside from healing for John's mom, the treatment worked across the country in Texas. Elaine Dilly tried to help her mother with stem cells, just like John had done. My husband and I would do anything to help her, but she would not be so lucky. The doctor came in and he tell me that we've got to airlift or her kidneys are shutting down six and have a heart attack. And I'm just kind of stunned. Were you afraid that you were gonna lose her? I knew I was gonna Loser. John and Elaine would both do anything for their mothers. They both place their hopes in the promise of a miracle cure. But that's not the only way they would come to be connected. I'm going to say that wherever there's opportunity, there's greed. And wherever there's money, there's green. When greed gets involved, bad things happen. What? You find out the truth of the host story. You just really can't believe anybody anymore. Now you tell me when we were on the phone earlier that you preferred not to use your name in this podcast. Can you tell me why that was just a preview of bad batch toe Listen to the rest.
