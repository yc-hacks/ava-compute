I'm Mark. I'm Lisa. Cheers. And welcome back. Uh, Lisa, we're at Heater Alan Brewing Brewing? Yes. OK, I think I've almost got a deadline. Is a heater Alan Brewing? I'm definitely excited. Be back. It's a kind of, ah, traditional Pacific Northwest cold, rainy day. Yeah, on dso you recommended. And we're drinking this Schwartz. Yes. So Schwartz means black in German. And when we made this originally, it was a short spear. But then the more we read about Schwartz beer and actually Czech style dark lover loggers called attorney pivo. We were like, This is much more of a check dark lager than it is a short spear. So, yeah, we still have the name Schwartz, but it is more of a check check. Dark lager. Czech style Dark lager than Veni Schwartz, German Short spear. So? Well, either way, it's still it's just Yeah, and it's perfect for a day like, Yeah, so Well, welcome back again. I think I've said that. Yeah, well, say it again because I always love having you here. Thanks for having me excited about this one because you just got back from the Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Yes. And you were there judging? Yes. Ah. And so we're gonna get to do something that I've been wanting to do on the podcast for a while, which is tasting and judging beer. Yeah, it's I think it's something that's very commonly done in the wine world. I mean, it's just like you go for wine tastings and, you know, it's just like and there's a whole thing to it right there. The whole method do it and how it works and what it does. And, uh, and you hear about it a little bit and beer. But I don't think quite so much. Yeah. Most of the time, I feel like it's also when people are drinking beer, they're drinking, you know, a full pint there, not just, you know, going thio a wine tasting where I feel it's because you're usually paying a lot of money for a bottle of wine. Um, you're not necessarily doing that with beer, and so you know, it makes sense to try before you buy a kind of thing. Where, since beer just is a little bit, you know, cheaper than wife. You know, I hadn't thought about it that way. Yeah. Total sense. Right? You can. If you buy a bad bottle of beer, you're probably gonna be all right. And even if a six pack you, it's not that that much and you give it to someone else. Yeah, Yeah, but yeah. Bottle of beer, bottle beer, a bottle of wine hand be an investment. Yeah. Okay. That total sense. Yeah. That said, though, I do love like getting the flights of ears on beer tastings and stuff, too. Because, um, I think, though on the opposite side of that is I get to enjoy them all. But then, by the time you find when you like, you're probably have had somebody, you're not ready for another, right? Yeah. I like to be the annoying person when I'm trying beer and just just get like, Can I get a little splash of that? I want to see a photo. I like it enough for full. No, that I That's something I have totally learned. Because yes, I mean, if it looks good, I have learned it's it's okay. And just about everywhere. Well, I guess you can't do it so much with hard liquor. Yeah, right. But with beer and wines is just asked for a taste. Because if you're going to get again a whole pint or a glass of something, you know, it's okay to want to know what you're getting. I think Yeah. And I think most servers to would rather you have something that you enjoy and you're not going Thio complain about get it right the first time. Yes. Uh, or just leave that I have had unfortunate to do this. You leave like the mostly full glass behind And servers, if you see that, ask. Yeah, I hate when they don't ask. And so sometimes I don't know. I don't wanna complain, but anyway, we're totally Yeah, we're getting on a tangent total, but it's all beer and beer tasting, so we'll bring it back here. So tell me a little bit about the Great American Beer Festival and kind of what it is and and how you got to be part of it. Yes. So the Great American Beer Festival is Thea largest competition in the U. S. Beer competition. I believe this is the I want to say 32nd year that they had a competition there. Judging competition. I feel like it's been going on longer, but I believe the first couple of years they just It was just a beer festival. And then they added the judging element to it a few years after they started it. I can't remember the numbers right off the top of my head. I'm horrible remembering numbers. I do know that there are about 300 over 300 judges, national and international. They dio bring in some international judges as well, and it takes place over three days. You have a morning session and an afternoon session that you're judging with the same group of people for like the morning session as you are for the afternoon session. There's a couple of different ways you can get to become a judge. A beer judge. There's a new organization called the B J C P. It's ah, I actually do not know what it seems. Okay, that's fair, but it is a It is a group of beer judges. I think it's like beer judge something, something that would make a sort of indication something you know, so B J c p judges you go through. It's a pretty rigorous process of testing and stuff like that where you have to go to number of competitions and you have to steward, which is essentially the people behind the scenes of a judging competition that are pouring out all the samples because it's all blind. So you do that for a while, and once you get enough points than you can like, I think sit and take a test. So if you're ready to become a judge, um, nowadays, I feel like most of the people that judge at G A, B, F and other beer festivals are professionals in the industry. So to be part of the B J C P, you don't necessarily have to be a professional brewer. Ah, lot of people now a G, A, B, F R, professional brewers or just professionals in the industry. So what I had to dio was fill out an application, and then with that application, you have to have three references. Usually they want at least one to be from a professional brewer. So yeah, and then There's a usually a pretty long turnaround time. So you submit your application and it's usually a couple of years before you get asked to judge. Yeah, um, it's shorter for ladies because because they're trying to get more women judges, as they should. Yeah, so for me, I think it was I turned in my application and into splits spring of 2017. And then, um, my first year judging was fall of 2018 at J B F. So I was actually 2019. This year was supposed to be my first year, because when they accept you there like your first judging will be a g a B f blah, blah, blah. And it's usually like a year or two away. Mine was 2019 but in 2018 they needed extra judges, so I got bumped up. I never argue with that. Yeah, yeah. So awesome. I guess tasting and judging are they? I mean, they're fairly similar, I would guess. I mean, one of obviously you're actually judging, but you would probably approach them the same. Yes. No. Yeah. Yeah. You're looking for similar things. I think when you're tasting even if you're just doing a tasting for fun or if you're, you know, having a beer flight, um, you're going to probably look at similar things. You're scrutinizing a little bit more when you're judging. Obviously, that makes that probably than when you're when you're just tasting for fun. But yeah, usually the first thing and everyone, I think, probably does stuff a little bit differently when I'm when I'm judging. And I usually as soon as the beer gets put down or close to when it gets put down, I'm going Thio, look at the beer and then smell the beer. That's just it's gonna be You're gonna have a really good fresh aroma shortly after gets poured. And so, um, that's the one thing with judging is that it does take time to do it. So you want to these beers to be, like, in the best shape possible and give them all, like, kind of a same chance. So you don't you know you want to try to smell it as soon as it gets put down, so you're not letting it just sit there and warm up and yeah, because that will, that will change things exactly, exactly. Aroma and appearance. And then obviously you're going to taste the beer. Typical things that you notice with beer. You're gonna notice bitterness. You're probably gonna notice Carbonation. Um, and a lot of these have to do with, like, mouth feels, well, sweetness, sour nous, all of those, um, sensations that we get from eating and tasty. Yeah, um, you're gonna notice those with beer, then obviously, aftertaste and finish. Um, and then from a judging point of view, you're maybe not going to necessarily do this if it's a just for fun tasting. But you're going to talk about the technical quality of the beer. And if you're judging in a competition like G A B F, you're going to look at how close it is to the style that you're judging. Okay, so So let's walk through these if you don't mind. And actually, what you just said makes sense. So I actually want to start their, um, the style you're judging. So obviously you're gonna judge each one differently, so it'll be categorized as bye. Is it by type of beer? How? They're just I mean, I'm sure it's different everywhere. Yeah, uh, just a high level. Yeah, there's different. There's different competitions, most competitions You're judging your judging to style. So say, Ah Schwartz bigger. For example, if you're judging, that's the style you have is I actually think that G a B f It's European dark lager. There's certain criteria that that beer should exhibit it shouldn't have a super high alcohol content. It should be a certain a certain color spectrum. It should have, You know, a certain carbonation. There's all of these little criteria. Do they tell you what you're gonna judge beforehand? You don't know until you get to Denver. So, um, you fill out they have you fill out a sheet of what kind of you would prefer to judge? Okay, but then you don't know what you're gonna be judging until until they have an orientation Tuesday, which you because usually the first session is Wednesday morning. That's when you get your sheet. That's like, this is thes air, the styles, your judgy and that works. And then do you do some quick research on that, or do they provide some guidelines? They have guidelines, so they have a book that they give you, and past years they actually will send it out to all breweries that are part of the birds Association. Now they're trying to do things more online for brewers. You in order to go to the style guidelines and say like, Oh, where do I want to enter this beer? That's all online now. But for the judges, they do print out a copy, Okay, And then before you're judging the style usually as a table, you'll someone will read through. And people, if you have any questions, can ask your fellow tablemates if you have a question about the style or, you know, how do you feel about this According to the style and different things like that? Okay. And that will make sense. And you gotta I understand what you're and which I think actually is helpful to because and I'm just kind of getting a it's very important if you're judging to know basis, you're judging on. But I'm also thinking if I'm walking into a tap room, um and I just kind of want to try something out that gives me an idea of I should probably, you know, I know a little bit about the beer I'm tasting and or ask questions of whoever's pouring whatever and kind of get a rough idea of what a European dark lager drinking European dark lager is and or would be. I mean, I guess you could just taste based on beer, but you need a point of reference somewhere. Yeah, by contrast, I'll talk about another competition that takes place here in Oregon, the Organ Beer Awards and that is Maur. You're not judging specific to style rather than in a competition like J B F. The different styles of Pilsners will kind of be put out. So you're judging all of the German style Pilsners with all the other German style Pilsners. Um, you're judging all of like the bohemian cell Pilsners with booking in south Pilsners, et cetera, et cetera. The O. B. A is It's all the Pilsners are together, so there's different categories that it's you know you'll have, like Cole style and, like cream ales and blondes will all be in the same category like kind of like light ales. So you are using the style as a base. But one of the things that I think is kind of cool about the organ beer awards that they've always said is that I mean, first and foremost, the beer should be, like, enjoyable. That's so I mean, s O that's when I've judged that one. It's kind of like, you know, it. Would you want to drink an entire pint of this, you know? Okay, I try to think of it that way. So whereas I mean, you're thinking that too, with G A B F. But I think it is a little bit more technical. Yeah. What? I'm also thinking some of that and you can correct me on this because I know neither about either one I'm imagining the great American Beer Festival is much larger than the Oregon. Yes, a part of that is when you've got thousands of entries, you could get a little bit more technical, narrowing down when you got fewer. You kind of got a group of. But I like that because when your group in him like that, then it is really about You know, what is the best beer or best tasting beer? I guess. Like you said in general, that the kind of fits in this category two does it meet all these specific exact requirements. Yeah, so you could have a variety of different beers that win medals at the warning of your awards. Whereas for J B F. You know it's the German style Pilsner is going to be addressed. Help filter the winds. So, at least for the most part, yeah, some people, some people, are a little liberal with their where they put beers. It's kind of an art. I feel like you go where your category to put your cat. Yeah, Where did put where to put your beer? No. And just cause this stuff is popping up because as you're talking, I'm listening to all the questions are coming up. So awards now that makes me think with wine, everyone's I've got a gold medal or a silver medal or a double gold and those actually mean stuff. To a degree, I mean, you know, there's a ba jillion different festivals and they're all grading and, you know, so you can get a gold medal. You can't get him that easy, but they they they give out several accepted anyway, you hear and read about them everywhere. You don't hear about that as much. I think, with beers is that. Do you have any idea on why or is that? You know, I think it's because I think part of the reason is just because beer is made year round, you're not necessarily trying to sell. Like we talked about the beginning. You're not selling or trying to sell a $70 bottle, talking about awards and stuff that you win, I think can help breweries. But I don't think it makes her brakes breweries. I don't think that there's enough people out there that are like, Well, I only drink beer that has won a gold medal at G H B F like theirs just because there's not a lot out there. Yeah, no, that makes sense. I totally make sense. It's It's a whole different way of approaching it. Yeah, yeah, so I think it's I think that's why you're trying to sell something that's a little bit more expensive with wine. So I think that's maybe why they kind of push their their awards a little bit more. Yeah, got in French a little bit more so and, you know, maybe beer. Drink your beer makers a little bit more humble too. I don't know. Maybe and, uh, but you gotta be proud of it. Should I Should I even ask if you guys have awards? We will. Yeah. So we haven't we? Actually, we've only entered J B f this. Well, this was our second time entering G A B f. And we did not win anything. Um, I haven't gotten the so we get all the feedback, which is nice, because you can No. Oh, why didn't people like this beer? Why didn't move on? Um, And then next year, you can maybe be like, Oh, this beer really should be in a different category than it is, um, and decide certain things Based on the feedback you get. It's also we have one ah, couple of the organ Beer awards. Nice. Okay. The won a gold medal last year for in Export Logger and then won a gold medal the year before. For a it was a beer called blockhouse beer, which was done for a art museum event. It was one of the historical beer category, So yeah, and J b fto. I've talked to people about it. It's a huge competition, and first and foremost, you have to make good beer And then, second of all, you have to be lucky, Because how your beer gets placed in flights and stuff like that can kind of make or break whether it is even gonna make it to get a metal. Okay, Yeah. Requires a little bit of luck as well. Yeah, Ok. And that and that makes total sense. But you're so proud of. You got medals? No. Yeah, I I love. Yeah. No, I'm super proud of the gold medals that we've won specifically life in my recipes. Oh, I know people who won gold medals, people. Okay, so now we're Let's get into this. So we start with appearance, and and we've got a couple of different forms here we're looking at, but But talk to me over about appearance and again, partly from judging, but also very much from, um, again, I just We're in a tap room, and we just got it. We got our Schwartz and and we're just kind of again We're probably not gonna be pretentious or Yeah, well, maybe as if we're tasting wine or judging a contest. But I still think it's a fun way to approach it. Yeah. Yeah. So you know. I mean, I feel like a lot of the time you get you get a beer, you kind of look at it, Look at the color if you order a stout and it's clear that, you know, maybe be a little bit weird or that it's, uh, pale in color. So, yeah, I think that's one of the things is looking how the beer looks and whether it's cloudy or clear, and that could be based on whether it's like, filtered or unfiltered. Or sometimes it's just I mean, we make unfiltered beard heater Alan, but oftentimes it settles clear, so it's gotta fit. I think that just gets back to fitting the expectations for that style pretty much right. So it should. If it's, you know, hazy, it probably shouldn't be clear if it's, you know, clear that it probably shouldn't be hasty And and, ah, like, said Dark should be dark. Light should be less exactly, and so it's really just kind of looking at it. So, and is there anything other than what you would normally expect? Is there? Does that tell you anything other than hey, it's a cool color. Sometimes you can actually look at the head retention, though, How much foam is on the beer and stuff like that and that can give you an idea of carbonation. Oh, which, you know, you're kind of looking at for judging, especially for certain styles. If it's supposed to have, um hi. Carbonation levels like a German style Half of ison typically has very high carbonation. So you would want to see some header attention, but yeah, Other than that, I mean, I know, I know some people don't like to have beer foam, but it's hard to produce a good beer foam, so yeah, so we like it. Ok, you go. And that doesn't get to what you're saying to is getting to it early as well, right? So the getting it Well, it's there. Yeah. Yeah. And usually you also could do like a little swirl I'm doing now and get the give the carve level toe make a little bit of a a little bit of a beer foam. Okay. And then another quick question on this and I'm just he's just knocked out my head. So we're just rolling with it. If so, say the appearance, it say it is a stout. Let's just go with that example. Ah, and it's a lot lighter than you would expect. But everything else on it is amazing, like the best out you've ever had. I mean, do you mark it down? Or I guess you'd note that Hey, it's too light. But then when you go to ultimately judge, I mean, is it like each section gets points and then the way, Yeah, the way I do it, the form that Mark and I are looking at a G A B F judge tasting notes form and it have certain sections. And then it has these little scales that you can do from, like, appropriate to non appropriate. I actually don't really like this sleigh out that much when I'm judging, because I think that overall I mean, I do kind of like I do like the appearance in aroma. I think that gives you a good base on a beer. But then all of this is just kind of like because the beer should come together cohesively like. And so I think that this kind of just muddles it out and separates it out too much. And, you know, it should all blend together really nicely if it's a well made beer. So but yeah, as you're going back to the stout question, if it's just a little bit too light on appearance, but otherwise is a really good beer, it would probably move on unless there were better beers on the flight or a beer. That was maybe just as good. But it had the correct coloring. So no, no, that makes sense. I'm just kind of curious. I mean, like, every other way. It is like the perfect stout, but it's light and color. Yeah, so it could potentially get dinged if there's another perfect. And everywhere you waste out that just a little bit better color. But if not, it might, it could potentially one. Yeah. Okay, well, that's why you have, like, another, like a little section of the bottom. That's like, other comments. So you could say, like, you know, really enjoyed this beer. It was delicious. Thought it was a little bit light, but other, you know, So you can you have room to tell the brewer like, Hey, I really like the beer, but you could improve in this, you know, section gotcha, which is why you're looking forward to getting some of the feedback cars and again, some of that you may look and go like, Oh, hey, maybe we should make this a little darker. Some of you may look at and go like, No, that's what we were trying to do. So that's fine if it doesn't. When the award. But it did everything. We wanted it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We wanted the lights down for a while. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So aroma, obviously we're gonna smell is the We just got swelling. This one. Is there anything in particular you're looking for? There again? I'm assuming that each style would have particular Roma's you're looking for. So let's start there. It's kind of I mean again, going back to a wine tasting. You're going up different flavor profiles, but beer? You d'oh. You know, give it a sniff with the Schwartz. Like I get some dark chocolate. I get a little bit of coffee. I get kind of this roasted note that is, you know, definitely from the malt. And so yeah, you're looking for for a beer like an I p a. You're gonna be You're probably gonna get a lot of like fruity or earthy piney Citrus from the hops. You're gonna get a lot more of that than this style is more mult driven. So you get more of the malt flavors and our multi aromas, and you do hop aromas. But yeah, you're looking for that. And the one thing I always say about tasting Thio, whether it is wine, beer, spirits, when you're tasting, people like to tell you, No, you're wrong. And I hate that because it's just like everyone has a different knows. Everyone has a different sense of smell. And so someone might be getting pepper and you don't get it. You know it? Yeah, so, yeah, I think that it's It's one of those things where some people try to be a little bit too pretentious about it, and it's like, No, it's, you know, something to enjoy. Yeah, you're gonna smell what you smell. That everyone's gonna smell some similar things. And not and I've had it before where I haven't smelled it. And then somebody said what they didn't like. It said on this one, I smell a little bit of nuttiness or whatever, and then I go back and go. Oh, you're right. Now I get it or pepper now and now I do. And so sometimes it's a little suggestion of what you're looking for. And sometimes again, even if I don't, that doesn't mean they're not exactly. Yeah, so yeah, I would agree. 100%. Yeah, 100%. You know, you can't tell me what it's not exactly, you know, exact. And so that's good. Okay, so now we've we've looked, we've smelled and we get to taste and and this one is actually we're talking about this little bit. It's broken down by taste and mouth feel, but a lot of them, you're saying that's kind of one and the same. Yeah. For me, those two are very combined because ah, a lot of the taste has influence on the mouth feel and vice versa. So I would if it was up to me, I'd rather look at them together. Yeah, you're looking four different characters that you would expect in that beer. And again, you can get different flavors, like from this again. I get kind of a lot of chocolate. I get some roasted malt. Ah, some of those types of flavors again. If you get if you're drinking something like an I p A, you're going to get a significant amount of bitterness. And there is, like even a little bit of bitterness in this, too, from the hops and the roasted malt. So yeah, it's that's and the mouthfeel is going to be the alcohol, the carbonation, the overall body of the beer. Is it thin? Is it? You know, heavy And I just feel like those the taste and mouth feel kind of go go together a little bit. So yeah, I would agree with that. And mouthfeel was one I kind of struggled with for a while until I realized it's simply as, like, you're just how does it feel in your mouth? I mean, that basic right? Is it again? Is it carbonated? Is it light? Is it you know what? How's how's it feeling while it's in there? And then it should be one would hope a good experience, right? Get in there just like, ooh, that's just not sitting right. And I've had some that. It's just, you know, they smell good. They do all this, but it just I don't know. For whatever reason bills either heavy or dry, or I don't know something in there. And you're just like That's not normal. Yeah, there's some what you can get, like an unpleasant one. I I get a lot with beers is like a cloying like a sweetness. That's kind of like that sticky sweetness. Yeah, yeah, not I've had I have, actually. Well, see, I really like. But that said, it's on Lee. Certain ones. Yeah, there's a couple I want to say There's a stouter too. Um, and maybe one other thing that I've had that have that where it works, but in general, Yeah, not so much. Yeah, it definitely is to style, too, because there's some styles. Like a barley wine, for example, is going to be pretty sweet. Um, some higher alcohol beers. Sometimes the alcohol comes across as a little bit of a sweetness as well. It just shouldn't I feel like it should. It can be sweet, but it also should be like balanced and not, you know, overly sweet. I got it. Okay. I like it. Okay, So now, now that we've got there now, we kind of get to the aftertaste and finish Oh, again, I know that there's certain things that, you know again a certain style of beer should have and you're looking for those. But what kind of generalizations? Maybe around some of that Sofer Yeah, aftertaste. I again and kind of, like depends on the style, but I like a beer That kind of like finishes like I don't I have maybe a little bit of a hint of that beer, but I don't have a lot sticking around. At least that's what I like so that just so that the finish would be, you know, you've got it, you're done. And it's not lingering basic thing. Okay, Yeah, got it. So finishes and it it's kind of it creates this, like, thirst quenching thing that makes you, you know, want to pick it up and have another. Yeah, actually, this one's doing. That's good, OK, And I get that feeling there something when you're done and it does, it kind of sits for a little while longer. So you said. And then there's someone. It's just done, and you're like, I want another one during our that that's your aftertaste and finished. Yeah, Anything else on on that one? Um, no, I think that's pretty much it. And again, it's gonna be different for different beers. So Okay. And then this one says technical quality eyes also on there. So, yeah, so that's gonna be if there's any If there's any flaws to the beer and a lot of those Ah, which actually going back to aroma really quick. You will. Ah. Lot of the flaws that you can get D M s die ass. It'll, um you're going to smell it in the beer a lot of the time. You'll also taste it as well, but you'll get that early on. So that's kind of technical quality is related to that. And also just I kind of look at it as too is like, Does the beer fit? Is it cohesive? How does it taste overall, you know, doesn't have any flaws. All of that sort of thing, is it, You know, Is it clear? Can you know those sorts of things? So, Okay, s So this is kind of Ah, that would be like an overall. Yeah. Kind of a score, maybe. Yeah. Yeah, like this one goes excellent. Very good. Good. Acceptable needs improvement. So It's like it doesn't really. I feel like it. You know, you should almost have a bad gnomes. Yea, nearest garbage. Have you had some of those? Yeah, I've had some that are just like a beer. That was ah, sour. That shouldn't have been sour. It was a style that was sour. So stuff like that you'll get sometimes you get I feel like you get very few that are, you know, really, really bad, especially in a competition like J B F. But, you know, you do get them. Yeah, because I know is that just some buddies feeling really brave and they're just rolling with it. Or could that be that something went wrong with their beer? And it's just unfortunate, either. Either case, yeah, the the one I was talking about that we had that was sour. All of us were talking about it. We almost think that it might have been It was bottle. It wasn't bottled very well. And so then it got infected, um, or just had too much oxygen. Get into it. So I mean, you can have that, like that's part of the risk. That's why you know, if you see If you see a note that's just like this tasted sour, you could be like, Oh, I should look at my bottling practices So I might have messed up somehow because that beer is not sour like it shouldn't be. So yeah, that's telling me Maybe that's why I didn't do so great. Now let's look at what we can do to improve. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, And then I like to throw out there because this is something that I got from the wine tasting episode we did that that I hadn't really thought of. But I think makes a big difference when you're tasting just about anything and that's that. You know, you do that. You do the look right. The appearance, the aroma, the taste. But I think what a lot of people don't do is you stop and take a second kind of experience and or think about it. Yeah. Ah, and it wasn't until I started doing that with again. Wine is kind of a reference point to a degree. A lot of this is that I started really noticing. Oh, there is this flavor, or that's what it's supposed to be tasting or or getting used to. Okay, This is what this particular grape tastes like. And I find that the same is with beer. If you just kind of locator, and then you just drink and then move on. Yeah. And you don't take that second or two to pause and think about it. You're not really experiencing it fully and registering. I think everything that you're tasting, yeah. Yeah, just my two cents. Yeah. No, exactly. Take a minute. Take it in. Yeah. Yeah, Enjoy it. I think what I didn't do often is take a second to just enjoy it, right? You're drinking a great beer. Oh, whatever it may be. Ah, so why not take a second? And just, like, like, let it sit for a moment and enjoy, And you should actually probably should deal with everything food, and all the other times, I think exactly too often I know me personally. Anyway, I'm just It tastes good. So I'm wolfing it down and you don't stop and take a second actually, like, really enjoy it. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I feel like I should also, since I had really think this book is great for beginners and people who want to know more about beer, but aren't super technical. This beer book I have out Tasting Beer by Randy Mosher. It's a very great, like intro I feel like to tasting beer. It also covers technical brewing. But the way that he explains it is very simple and easy to understand. And I know there's a lot of people that really like this book, and it it even has, like, a little style thing in the background so you can learn more about Stiles. You're tasting it. It has a thing of food and be repairing in here and glassware. And how to If you wanted to do your own tasting, how to do your own tasting a little history and they're so out of everything in there. I love it. Oh, some recipes. Oh, yeah, totally staging a beer dinner, all sorts of stuff. Tasting beer by Randy Mosher Mosher, which is M O s h E R. Yet. Okay. Note. I might have to get myself a copy of that. Andi, I think it comes highly recommended. And if you're recommending it, then I'm accepted it. Yeah, Yeah, it's ah, has some really interesting that end like history. and all that stuff too. So all the fun facts that we love exactly. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. All right. Anything else to kind of share on wine tasting, judging, beer tasting judging? Yeah, that would be it. I know what I'm drinking. I swear. Um, yes, on beer tasting. And Jenna, I'm going to get on my little high horse for a minute. Oh, but, um, I feel like one thing that people they talk about a lot in wine, but they don't talk about it. Beer is proper glassware, and the pubs in such of the world just have shaker pines, which is essentially a standard pint glass that you would think of. If you think of a pint glass, it's probably a shaker. Point is what you're thinking of. And it's called a shaker pint because they're meant to shake cocktails. They're not meant for beer. Oh, I My thing is that there are certain glasses that are really great for beer. And if you're really into Pilsners, say, maybe you look up and be like, Oh, what's what's a pilsner glass? And try drinking it out of a pilsner glass versus a shaker pint and you'll notice a difference because there have been glasses that are created four, sir, and beer styles. Um, we use that heater, Alan, we use just like a generic Stein, which is for yeah, um, just for a lot of lager beers. But there are pilsner Glass is half of ice and glasses. I p A glasses now, and it's just it's it's a whole different world of experience drinking out of a good glass, you know? And I I had some a little dubious about that in the past, but then when it was kind of explained to me, it makes a lot of sense because it is goingto change how it the glassware, how it goes into the mouths of which, where it's gonna hit on the tongue when the win and how the aromas air going to stir in the glass and hit on the nose, Which is a big part of taste, of course. Yeah. Ah, lot of these things, really. I mean, the glass can make a huge, huge difference you're spot on. So I will I will agree with that because I I tried to say no. And then somebody said Okay, this class in this class, and I had to say Okay. Yeah, you are, right. Yeah, There's Ah, at the craft Brewers conference, I went to a talk where a glass producer granted, They were also trying to sell their glasses, but But they did a tasting of, like, a the same beer in a shaker pint and then in one of their glasses. And I had never really thought that much about it before. And after that, I was just like, Wow, this is That's amazing. That does make a huge difference. Yeah, and I never thought about it, but those are the exact classes they used to shake cocktails. And I did not realize that that was its sole purpose. I guess I had assumed that it was a beer glass that they were repurpose ing. Yeah, but it's the exact opposite. And they're easy, like I understand, in a way. Why? Like bars and restaurants use them, they're there. They stack really easy. You have, like, one standard rack. Yeah, that you can put them in. And so I understand why they use them. But I'm always a little bit dubious of going to a brewery, and they're serving up Shake you just one of my Yeah, Just a little bit of ah, again, me getting on my high horse. So that's all right. That's right. They're cheap. So I understand that from a business, please. Yeah, yeah, but if you're a home and or maybe your brewery out there, splurge a little bit and I actually found I mean, I've got some really nice I've got every day, one glasses and then some really nice ones. And I've actually really nice whiskey glass. Now I've got other kind of glassware. I'm gonna have to get some nice beer. Where now? Because I think all I have are shaker point I I used to have I used have Atanas. Well, I've slowly got rid of mine, so Okay, well, I will. I will. I will replace my own. A quick question on that. While we're talking about it. Does the temperature of the glass matter because I know that some people will freeze them and have them ready to go. Is that actually gonna make a dramatic temperature of glass? Not really. Temperature of beer will make a difference in the tasting. Eso Certain beer styles are served are meant to be served at colder temperatures. Certain styles are meant to be served like closer to room temperature. Especially if you're looking at like traditional German ails our English ale. Sorry, not German ales. I'm used to say in traditional German via the style of years. Oh, yeah? You got a job? I just called it a wine tasting. Yeah, here. So it's all good here, but yes. So the glass doesn't. I know some people like a frosty glass. One thing that I think actually does help is rinsing the glass out with a little bit of water just to make sure you're getting any dust out of there and stuff like that. Um, and a tiny bit of water isn't going to really affect the beer. If there's a little bit left in the glass, it's a good beard. Should make a difference. That little? Yeah, in the in the tap room here we the glassware gets kind of warm. So in the summer, if it's really hot in here, we we will put it in the fridge. But you don't have thio. Just it just pours like you get. So as beer gets warmer, the carbonation will come out of solution. So if your if your glass is really warm than it, your beer might you might see your beer being, like, really foamy, and so that that can affect modified. But it's not like it's not critical. Okay, but it is kind of fun and cool. Maybe. Is yeah. Okay. You know, if you like a cool he's right. If you like a frosty mug doing kind of a frosty mug. Well, do what you like, obviously, but I would just kind of curious if that actually would affect cause we know the type of glass will has one of the temperature last will, And it may have a minor effect, but nowhere near as much as the proper glassware will. Yeah. Okay. Noted anything. Anything else to share? I think that's it. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, well, they could get more information about heater Alan heater, alan dot com, or we're on the social media's Facebook, and our instagram is at Heater Alan Bir. So on the tasting room where we are now is in McMinnville, Oregon. So your area stop by check the hour's, though. Yeah, we're open. We just switched recently. Switch to our winter hours. So we're open Fridays, Um, 2 to 6. And then Saturday we're open noon to six. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. And then, of course, unsophisticated palate. Is that the unsophisticated palate dot com? Ah, raid us. Give the stars. Tell a friend Ah, all that other fun stuff until next time. Drink responsibly. Cheers. Cheers. Wait."

A podcast about all things wine, beer and spirits. Join us each week as we drink and delve into different alcohol related topics. I'm Mark I'm C and I'm Dave. Cheers. Cheers and welcome back, guys, we're here for Part two. Let's let's pick up and carry on. Let's talk more rum. So now I've got rum. Right eye. We have it. We've gone through the fermentation process. We're just still got You've got fermented sugar cane. Okay, let's let's go there. I've got fermented sugar cane juice. What happens then? Typically, it's around 9% alcohol, so it's like a good, strong beer. It's in between beer and wine. Does the sugar cane juice skit higher than molasses? Alcoholic can. But we use a yeast that likes to hover around 10 to 15% and because we don't do anything with our fresh sugarcane juice, it caps out naturally, it about eight or 9% so we don't even dilute it. We literally just use the fresh juice and add yeast and and I'm a little Could you just drink that right there? And it's back to a delicious because run is the latest be precludes us from making a beer and a and a spirit in the same space. Okay, but if we had a wall in between our fermenters, we could actually and sell sugar cane beer and that we're fine. And so there is a sugar came beer at tiles. They're good. And if you look at any country where there sugar cane, there's three guys in the back that air drinking the sugar cane beer. Okay, I'm I find that hard cider. Yeah, it tastes a lot like a good taste. Good. Super good. Okay, I'm sorry, You guys air dropping the fax and I'm loving him, and I just I want I like, drill here and make sure I'm understanding we take this fermented beer and we put it into a still, okay? And then we boil off the parts of it that we want to become the rum. Okay. And the reason why it's called spirit is because it literally disappears into vapor between the pot and when it gets re condensed back into a liquid. So whatever spirit you're making literally becomes a spirit, if you will, before it's re condense. So the trick is to figure out back to that flavor percentage thing. How much of that juice do we want to also have come out as well as all the alcohol? So we actually, when we're making Rome Agricole, we can't let a super high percentage of the juice come through. So will at times have up to 50% juice with 50% alcohol. Okay, means two things. One is tons of flavor. Yeah, and two is We don't have to day lewd it as much. So we don't have to add a lot of water and let it get down to 40% alcohol. Because by the time we're done, the entire batch is close to around 60% alcohol. Right where you want it to be, anyway. Yeah, it's very close. Nice. Okay, awesome. Okay, so now we have room. Yes. Now we have rum, but that only 3% of the world's rum is made like that. Those people for making from molasses. And most people haven't come out at a much higher a B V. And then have you heard of Gold Room? I know the name, but I know a little about so tall, dark room. And that's where I was kind of going toe. You have light rum, you got dark room, you got gold room, you got spiced rum. So if you have a spirit that's 94 A. B V doesn't have a lot of flavor, and you wanted to be interesting. If you add food coloring or caramel coloring some sugar to it, you call it gold rum that same afternoon. Okay, so a lot of gold rum is created by adding caramel coloring and sugar to it, because because the room itself wasn't terribly interesting. Kind of like gold tequila, right? Is that what a gold tequila would be? Well, your golden means colored and flavor means it hasn't been put in a bear, but it sounds a whole lot better. Call gold number. What? It's not. So I would kind of like it was good. What? You Cuervo Gold Way don't want to despair it anyway. Well, no, no. And we're not disparaging. It's just interesting that that's what gold means it. And I've had excellent gold, whatever drinks by saying good ones that I have enjoyed. So but so gold is you got it. You color it, you sugar it up a little bit and you ship it out. Yep. Okay. And And the reason for putting that color in is to make it look like it's been aging in a barrel. Okay, because well, when you put a spirit in a barrel, it will take on that color that we all recognize in a good whiskey or a good Scotch or a good brandy. And that came from the barrel. Yeah, and that's my understanding in that cash. A lot of money and it costs a lot of money. Takes a lot of a lot of my eye because my understanding you can correct me on this is basically a difference. Being a moonshine and a whisky is that it's been barrel aged. Is that fairly accurate? Oh, no. I mean, moonshine brings in a whole new Well, now there's There's moonshine. Particularly later, Stanley, That was it. The legal definition moonshine is means that nobody paid their taxes on it. Well, yeah, OK. Which means it's illegal. That makes sense, actually. Okay, So the reason why it's moonshine is because he did it outside at night, far away from getting arrested, still in the basement are hidden. Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of different moon shines. Some are really, really good, right? Summer, and some of them are paying their taxes and legalizing so that the definition of moonshine is becoming very. And we've got a moonshine episode coming up. I know it's probably a few weeks, but we're working on it. One for most moonshine recipe Zahra Corn Wrist, ironically, are coincidentally, actually, is either a corn corn whiskey. Mostly corn, because it's cheap. So are most of the sugar. I was going to say where most most moon shines air, actually, rum Oh, because they take bags of white sugar and they mix it with water and they throw a little corn and for flavor, a little corn for flavor or not, depending most most moonshiners. Steve is basically it's Technically, you'd be wrong because they didn't pay their taxes. It's moonshine. Okay, interesting. Okay, now, dark room. It's so dark. Rum is again. You start with the same white rum, actually, 90 94% a BB coming out of the still not that much flavor. And now you pour molasses into it. Okay, which is super confusing because it started with molasses. And but that molasses gives it that dark, rich, sugary flavor. Yeah, I have to admit, I like a good dark like people, like, Sure. Ty says it is very sugary and sweet that my gosh wings with that. Gosh, Ling's owe the IRS dark, dark and stormy yet. Sames Meyers. Right? So what we do a lot of drinks. They put that that and I think it also cause it looks good, but a little bit of dark room on operator. Yeah. Yeah, the floater. Okay, so, yes. So? So when we make rooms, we don't put any flavors. Colors of sugars. Okay, um because what we're trying to do is make the Rama's tastiest possible. And I think there's a big movement with a lot of people about wanting to know where their food comes from and how it's made, and they want it made in a way that they feel like they can get behind. Um and so there's most of the world doesn't actually do what the American market the American rooms do. So I I think nine of 10 of the biggest rum makers have some sort of coloring flavors or sugars added to their products. Okay, Okay, because I did notice you guys don't have atleast it doesn't look like a dark room. And that Would that be why or you do we D'oh, that one's called Nana. Okay, that is the same color as it's just not super dark. Got it. It hasn't been flavored. I mean, hasn't been colored. Hasn't so that zinc, but then you don't further cover it beyond that. All right? But it is colored from the wood, its color from barrels. It's parallel. Just a barrel aged Farrell age. So, like a bourbon, it's the same colors a bourbon. It's the same colors of brandy because they're all age the same way. And is that this one that I'm drinking year? Okay, Okay. This is the then and now. None there now, Okay. And a little less color than the bourbon, because it's a GED and a use barrel. Yeah, and there's 23 and four years, whereas all bourbon has to be four years. Yeah, you can paste. Yeah, you can taste the barrel. There's a There's a bourbon that's six months old and your color bourbon. You just can't call it straight bourbon guy so you can have a very young bourbon. Okay, but to be straight has to be two years old. Okay? And to be good, older, well, or maybe it's just Cheryl. Least the ones I had Let's put it over can definitely be better. But there's some young bourbons that are wonderful, but it's a good point. What happened barrel is there's fatty acid chains in all spirits, and that comes out towards the end of the run. If you do a pot still, um, but those fatty acid chains actually get broken up by, for example, the linguine in the oak and that will create living lignin. Thank you. Link arms on your body. Thank you. Lignin is the structural stuff in trees, right? And so that will actually break these fatty acid chains into other chemical compounds. One of them, for example, is vanilla, and I'm probably mispronouncing that as well. No one, Yeah, which is the same chemical that the orchid plant may we call vanilla if you oxidized lignin. I think you've formed vanilla. So the point is, is the barrels magic and that's because you do. You get it. I mean winds all the different things. That's where you get the vanilla flavors. They said that the toasty, um, coconut coconut, yeah, caramel things. They're all coming from interacting with the oak and the char of the oak. Okay, so that's why you stick in the barrel. Interesting. There's awesome. Apparel is awesome. Okay, so we've talked basic rum, your Is there a way that would that just be a light rum? Is that well for light? By definition, if use our definition is is how much? What percentage? Alcohol. Did it come out of this still out If it came out, it's a 90% or higher. It's like Whatever. Okay, if it comes out between 80 and 90% um, it's got a little bit more body. And if it comes out less than 80% a B V, then it's Ah, hi con Jenner spirit. So bourbons Rum Agricole's really good spirits usually come out at 80% or last single malts. All that stuff with that fantastic flavor. Yeah, the only way to get that flavor is toe. Let some of that juice come out of this. Still, So 80% usually is the rule max a B V coming out so light. Actually, it's almost night its flavor, as I was about to say, I sounded bad to say it, but light on flavor. Yes. Okay. Heavy on alcohol. Heavy on water, light on flavor. Okay. So, like, actually a technical term, right? 90% right? Is it 92? 94%. Well, for American whiskey, it's anything between 80 and 95. Okay, so they got okay. Okay. Anything below 80. Okay. And I don't know what it is for rum, but I know it's 94 to I think it's 90 or 85. Term for wrong. Okay, so rum is a very confusing category, Fortunately, Yeah. And and rum, for example. You're allowed to put in 2% by volume, flavors and colors, which is where golden and molasses rooms can come from. And then, of course, the next big room. Yeah, sugar. So most rooms have sugar in, so some of the some of these rooms have been tested to have more than 50 grams of sugar per bottle. Okay, so there are more than a couple. They're almost liqueurs. Wow. Okay, of course, when you take sugar as a human being or a life, you go young on Earth, you think? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it makes sense. Okay. And then So the last one I want to head on is a spiced rum. So, Spicer, I'm same thing. But now they're being totally forthcoming. Of course, it's colored, of course, is flavored and spice just means full on flavor. So it could be anything. So when you call it spicy, get beyond the 2% rule. I think they're on Lee forthcoming because the U. S government makes the other ones the U. S. Government doesn't make it. And if you hide, if you're under 2% you don't have to tell anybody. Okay, so now I had thought that spiced was perhaps I will I guess it is intentional. But I was thinking they were adding in like in a cinnamon or whatever kind of flavors to give yet but cinnamon, vanilla. And so the point is to enhance kind of flavor, but maybe it's just tow us. That's what the bartender should be doing. Super high quality rums that the bartender can use is an ingredient in their cocktails. God, not every cocktail wants to have the same profile, and a bartender is going to spend a little bit more money and thought into what flavors they want in their cocktail, then having a syrup that is meant to be good for all. Gotcha. But I will say I enjoy a good spiced rum. And so I guess, done proper. Yeah, yeah. Exact. So done proper. But I do like kind of the thinking or theory. Behind this is here's your wrong ingredient. Great. My tie with a spiced rum. That is very true. You can make a great Dockery with the spice run, but you can't do it with a gold or a dark room. I Yeah. Okay. I could make a pretty good, but not a great one. Right? There you go. And from what I'm learning, I might have to agree. Okay, So is there any other category of rooms I've missed our way should talk about that. Zoe's ones. I know the big ones. Yeah. So most, most most is made from glasses. The new thing that most people are doing because molasses production is sugar production is getting so good that there's not a whole lot of sugar left in the molasses. So what a lot of rum makers are doing now is they're making out of sugar. So white sugar or sometimes sugar with a little molasses in it, like a dark sugar or turban nado or or Demerara. These air all terms for sugars with a little bit of flavor in him. Dehydrated cane juice, Cesaire all euphemisms for basically dried sugar. Okay, and then and then I'd say that's definitely growing, but still, you know, 3% or Lasses from the fresh juice itself. And the reason why really is because it's super difficult to deal with that fresh juice because although we thought it would be super easy to make it because it was already good to go. Turns out every micro organism on the planet Earth, including also actor is also likes it. And there Oh yeah, immediately. Okay, now our challenges is how do we get our yeast to proliferate and everything else go away? And so that's super challenging. But think of it, if you will like, you have a very successful party and there's too many people in your house and you don't know what to do. And there maybe there's a bad element that's getting bigger and bigger that you just don't want part of change the music. Oh, the lights. You can get rid of 2/3 of the people almost immediately by those two things. So we'll employ tricks that air analog to that in order to make sure our yeast is super happy. Um, or you gotta fill your house with the right people first. That's an accident before the show. And then you create the conditions for the music. Delighting got control it. That's right. So you're in your sugar cane juice. I mean, it's being infested right now, and you don't even know it tasted. I've been tasting it, and I think I'm okay with the fact that he's being infested and more. That's, you know, that's why it's served to you refrigerated. So that's That's a knob v ISS trick that people have learned a long time ago to keep the micro micro organisms that day. Yeah, refrigeration, right? It's 37 degrees. They're not so happy. And they're gonna be pretty dormant, as is the East. So little tricks like that could go along with nice. I think there's a couple of rooms that you forgot talk about which ones Well, the second one's more important, but I'll talk about the 1st 1 first. What's the one they make in Brazil that they shall room? Exactly? Chaz is kind of neat, Ka cha says. Catch houses? No, I always heard they call it Cash Ahsha. So we have actually Brazilian. Sitting next to us, he put his thumb up. Which one? How did they pronounce it shot? So cautious is kind of cool because Coach Shah says, like an Agricole. But they don't. They're not a stuffy is the French, so they don't stick to all the rules. So maybe they put a little sugar in. Maybe they put a little fresh juice and kind of whatever is working. But it's a spirit made from sugar cane, and it's and it's and it's very juice forward because Brazil's Brazil, they don't want to be associated with rum. They want they caught something different, so they they're on this marketing campaign to make sure people call it Sasha. It's different than run, but it's it's totally rums, totally room, and it's it's It's sort of a hybrid between the two and it. What's wrong? I mean, by definition it's wrong, but the Brazilian say no, no, but what they're doing different is nothing. Really. Okay, It's It's wrong. We want to make it their fresh sugarcane juice. That's great. And it's delicious, but they won't have their own name. Like, you know, tequila has to kill a I mean, you know it. You name it for the region of the area, or you come up with it and you branded and you go. Yeah, And if you like Kinshasa, you're gonna love Rome Agricole. Okay? Which I've been very much enjoying, by the way. So wait, there's one. There was two really really Old Agricole. You haven't talked about age eight. Agricole's incorrect from from places like Martinique? Yes, because in Hawaii we don't have that. We're working on it. You're still aging. That's that's the challenge with everything. Right? So you said you're gonna promise us one thing. You're going to open the Ron Centenario. It will be opened this week. You need to run to your local good liquor store and buy a bottle of aged miracle and drink. It may call it rum vou. Okay, hold on. I gotta write this down. Agricole from Martini Martini, Cassidy for martini. Martinique. Okay. And what was or it might be called. One of the descriptors on that bottle will say rum vou. Spell it the, uh U X, I think. Okay, this means old rum. Okay, Now you get this Room Agricole, which is magical, and then you stick it in a barrel, which is magical. So I don't even know how to describe that much magic. So it's one of the best drinks on the planet on which is what Cool Yana will have one day we're aging it. Now we've got we've got a big room full of barrels that we got from Cognac France on We're aging. Our rum quickly as we can in these barrels is quickly and slow at the same time because that's one of things that just time filling the barrels as quickly as we can. And then and then you know, we're in Hawaii, so it's humid and it's hot, so we have a little bit of advantage on how quickly those chemical reactions can happen. You know, heat is energy, and the more heat you have, the more energy you have. So the more reactions quicker the reactions happen. Okay, so we got a little advantage there, but way Pay for that by age is still a great well, ages still age, so reactions were reactions. Energy, energy is is age. Oh, that makes sense. Okay, But we pay for it because, well, actually, lose a lot out of the barrels quicker because those eyes forcing the vapors out of the barrel. Yeah. Yeah, actually, throw a con founding factor out there. Temperature. Colder temperature. So word of most fish hang out. You know this. Oh, wait. I know. Cool. Anna Rump sack. Okay, The ocean. So So sees you, Aires. But where in the ocean? No. Where do you find more fish in the sea? I hear what you're saying. I hear what he's saying, so yeah, for sure. The colder oceans. Why and why? Huh? Why? Because that's where all the nutrients air and wire the nutrients. Sir, I don't know what oxygen there's more dissolved oxygen and cold temperature than warm temperature. So because I had this argument with the with the guy from Scotland, and why do we like really old spirits? Because you get oxidative reactions that form. Okay. Long chain Esther's. That's a good one. I had an argument. The guy from Scotland. He won. I learned about this, and he's right in warmer climates like Mexico, tequila, Caribbean or Hawaii for rum, you age your products faster. You do a different kind of aging faster. You do extractive, aging faster, not oxidative aging and the Holy Grail for guys and ladies that, like good spirits, long chain Esther's long chain Esther's form fast from colder climates like Scotland Just trying to think about. So we might want to send some of our barrels to cold climate like Park City age, just saying, I think there might be some selfish a shelf in my base thing about Hawaii's. We actually have 11 of the world's 13 climate right here on I was I was gonna say you might wanna have my house is at 3000 feet. I'm thinking that might be you might wanna have some aging up higher, like the highest aging of rum on the planet, like up in the observatory. Everybody, everybody ignore this because this is actually a secret little program that we've got going in the skunk works that nobody here will tell anybody. Okay, good. Okay. But so that the point being Oh, yeah. If you haven't had an age that you're cool. They are some of the most beautiful products on the planet from Martinique and go spin, and they for me, they're probably the least expensive, most aged, beautiful. So if you do a ratio of cost per long chain Esther, you get more long chain Esther's in some of the Age Agricole's per to your dollar than any other product, cause they're just not discovered yet. Yeah, yeah, So I go discover some get get a a Jericho on you pay better price for more beautiful product in a jogger cold in any other age product. A couple good ones. They're easy to find a Claremont if you get your hands on the rum. Rum liberation. Okay, Dad, that's a good one. You can't cause I show him in Astro Wind asteroids yet. So there's there's there's a lot of fantastic ones. Okay, I am committing here and now before the end of the week, I will open the room. Gotta have it home. Yep. We'll find out if it's a real 20 Earth 20 number. I'm sure it's his 21 on the label and I will commit by the end of November. I will have me a bottle of the aged agriculture all you want for Christmas. We have. When we have it at the bar here. We have all kinds of fantastic. Do you Do you have a favorable shares? So, of course, what? You do have one of the ones we've just been talking about for the end of the night. A reason to visit Hawaii? Yes, OK. Before the end of the night, I will. I will have some of that. I will try that. Another thing we want to talk about here really quick because we've talked about rum. Rum is delicious. I've been drinking it on my own. Here is we go along here. I've got my little flight of rums and it's all been delicious. And a month of my age now. So super high level. How would you maybe approach a rum? Why should you maybe drink it that way instead of in a bottle around about? I'm sorry. In a cocktail, if you're looking for a different way to drink a spirit than you probably are used to because obviously you get an age rum. It's total analog to any age whiskey you stick it on ice, you do it straight. Whatever you want. You put a good age drum in any cocktail that calls for whiskey. It's fantastic if you put a white rum and anything that has gin in it, it's fantastic. But a cool way to drink it is how they do it in Martinique, so they have something called T punch T I. And then the word punch guarantee. I is a what you call a word that's been made shorter, not a contraction. But maybe it's a double contraction abbreviation. Thank you, um, of petite. It's basically an amuse bouch, right? A little a small little taste. So they give you some of their local agricole, and then they'll put a little bit of fruit juice or whatever tickled their fancy that day. So it might be some passion fruit juice. It might be some mango sliced whatever. So room temperature. Rum Agricole usually traditionally had had a couple drops of lime and a little bit of like fresh sugarcane juice. Okay, And just give it to your room temperature, and it's incredible. The National Drink of Martini. Yeah, it is. It's fantastic noted so you because I've only known rum as a cocktail drink, so I always just assumed. And I've had some good rum since then, so I've now learned you can drink it. But for the majority of my life, probably meeting up until within the last year or two. I had always just assumed rum was meant to be in a cocktail, and you shouldn't drink it on its own. And we're dispelling that myth here and now. Yes. Oh, rum. It's a gold room. Should be in a cocktail. Okay, Okay. Let's Let's redefine that cabinet like I'm walking up to a room. Would this be like you sniff your taste? I mean, yeah. And as you would any great scotch, any great whisky, any great cognac should be treated exactly the same way. Awesome. Okay, now, if I were to put it in a cocktail, definitely put in a cocktail. What? What? What? What do you guys is Cocktail? I would start with turn, making an old fashioned, and we do that here, in fact, way. Make our old fashioned from the non Arab interesting. Okay. And we we have ah, challenge. Delicious. It's delicious. Reaching order around and then and then we also have, For example, they negroni Wait Negroni. Yeah, we got a new grant. We haven't a groaning on the menu there called the Light. She who? Dave just had one already. And it's and we put in the hoodie, which is a blend. It's an Agricole blend. So it's some of our Agricole plus, ah, light round that we get from Papa New Guinea. And we put that in in place of the jinn. So it's more like a boulevard. Well, if you were to put whiskey and enviable of our d A. But if you put rum in it, we gotta come up with the name. But we call it the Light. She who and so well, actually put a little light she flavor in the ice, and so that's why it's called like yoo hoo. So any time you use a whiskey or substitute a good age room, if you start doing that with your aged Agricole, your gold. But if it's a really, really good age after Cole need yet okay, awesome. I mean, all spirits kind of run on the same themes, you know, just out of curiosity, always we're going to wrap up a little bit here. Any parting thoughts on the only thing you want to share? Anything you know, I'd say basically, all these questions sort of point toe. One simple thing that's happening. Rum is coming of age right now. It used to be terrific, and then it got lost. Somewhere along the way became sweetened. It became flavor to became colored. It required fruit juices to drink funny names, all these kinds of things, but, ironically, the people that the whole tiki craze that created some of these cocktails that made people think it's supposed to be sweet and it's supposed to have an umbrella and it's gotta have four kinds of juices in it are now realizing that excellent rum makes her cocktails way better. And the original tiki creators were never thought of using any of the rooms that are currently available. So the tiki craze and all these run bars that are now opening up are actually going towards all of these rooms with no flavors, no colors, no sugars added. They're going for super high quality rums. Obviously, we think it's the best spirit you could make. And so the opportunity now is is that people are like this fun and familiar drink is now actually become a serious contender. And the numbers are already showing that people are super excited about it. So what we're trying to do, it's just deliver the highest quality rooms that we can that sort of satisfy all of this stuff and makes him some excellent products for bar programs and people at home and people that want to get into spirits Thio get excited about. It's very similar to how Tequila waas in the eighties. Yeah, that's a good point. So somebody just asked me how much juice is supposed to be in a mai tais. If you take the three original Mai Tai recipes which were all invented sort of right after the war, none of them put fruit juice in it. The only fruit juice in a mai tais, 3/4 of an ounce of lime juice. Wow. Okay. And it also doesn't have a dark room floater. Okay, wait. So what's Ah, what's an original? My time Original. My tie. If you use, for example, the Trader Vic recipe, which is arguably a contender for the original. Might I? It's ah announce of Rhum Agricole. It's an ounce of white or dark white. Thank you. It's an ounce of high con Jenner. I eat like a Jamaican dark rum, aged rum that's 3/4 of an ounce of lime juice. You can put in around as much again 3/4 announced a little bit more, maybe an ounce of or jot syrup, which is an almond syrup or almond almond syrup. And then a little bit of bidders. A little bit of like orange, Curacao, uh, and and we put a little mint. Um, and then we actually use the bidders as a floater. And that's very similar to the original Mai Tai recipes. And it's incredible and it's not. It's not a fruit juicy supersweet thing. It's. And when you have one, just go ask for a nog, might I? Wherever you are, it's incredible, and it sounds like you guys are serving those here. That's that's the number one cocktail here by far, and I'm getting thirsty. Way definitely run into people that are looking for the orange juice, and they want to know where the room floater is, and we just say, Try it, and if you don't like it will make you whatever you're usedto have it. So you have both kinds of mai tais. Well, you can have whatever you want. You got to make the country and western country got Donny and Marie Little Country Little Rock and roll. I like it. I like it awesome. I think what Steve was trans se is rum is like the last of all the categories to kind of premium eyes and get good. So it's getting good. Now I like I like where it's going And, uh, you guys, obviously we recommend, I mean highly recommend come to the island of Hawaii and visit. However, if they can't, where can they find you online? I'm assuming the Web. Can you guys ship? That's a good question. We like that question. Um, we're now in five states, currently all of Hawaii, California, Nevada, Arizona and Washington. And then over the next, even next year, we're looking at states surrounding those areas and going east. Um, and our goal is to be available nationwide within a few years. Very nice. Very nice. So what's the website? Juliana rum dot com and Cool Yana is k u l e a n a rum dot com Correct. Perfect. Awesome. Want to get people there?

A podcast about all things wine, beer and spirits Join us each week as we drink and delve into different alcohol related topics. I'm Mark. I'm safe and I'm David. Cheers. All right. And we drink. Okay. And that is delicious. That is the ESA hooey. Hooey. Hooey! Hooey. Un aged rum. That's actually three un h room. Splendid together. Excellent. Excellent. Okay, so if people didn't figure this out by now, we're talking about rum today and we're out here, and I am going to probably potentially butcher the name. Here it is. Who? Liana. Perfect. That was perfect. So Cal sounds out here on the island on the big island of Hawaii, and we are in the UAE. Waikoloa Village. Perfect. Yeah, we're actually Waikoloa Beach Resort, Michael. Oh, Beach resort. And, uh, where Cool Yana Rum works talking about rum. And we've got Steve here as well. So Steve much tell us a little bit about who you are and what you do. Uh, my name is Steve Jefferson. I was born and raised in Hawaii. I moved here when I was about 12 years old to the Big Island from Oahu. and I got into rum when my wife and I and our two Children, one and three at the time were sailing around in the Caribbean when we stopped in an island called Martinique, Um, and Justus, a typical day trip went up and tried some rum. Notice how similar it was to Hawaii. Notice that they had sugarcane farms and a lot of the stuff just really resembled back home, Same plants. And, uh, we tried some of the rum, and I remember being so blown away with what it tasted like that you know, I asked my mom, you know, what is this? And they said, It's a product called Rahm Agricole, which is French for agricultural rum. Okay, and it turns out that less than 3% of the world's room is made that way because they make it with fresh sugarcane shoes. And when I learned that and how good it was, I remember turning to my wife and saying, We got to move back to White and started Rum Distillery that now that's idle event. We've got to go make room. And she took that pretty well. Well, she hears things like this. Probably 45 times a week. Okay, but this one stuck, and she obviously liked the idea and made it happen. Awesome. And here we are. And so that one's a little bit along. Lines of kind of your history, relationship with alcohol as well. We like that kind of asked everybody that anything before that I was a fan of rum and never enjoyed a lot of the room that was offered. But I remember gravitating towards Mount Gay. Um, and I thought that was a pretty good rum, and I wasn't sure why I liked it, but I knew what I liked about it is it hadn't been sweetened. It wasn't flavored. And there wasn't a pirate involved. And so it makes me wish I was like, the name. Yeah. Okay. It's a good name. I like the knights of good night. Yeah, awesome. All right. And so, David, What? Let's hear a little bit about who you are, what you do. And then you're kind of a relationship with with alcohol. Yes. Um, it's long. Uh, well, it's It's, you know, I always liked it. I'm tryingto I haven't been asked this question for a long time, so I'm trying to, You know, I think my relationship with alcohol, I think it started in college. A lot of them start well, right? Was it with cheap beer? And, uh uh, it was I went to school in Virginia. Okay. And the the sort of national drink of the college was bourbon. 00 that means so where you were, people would bring ah, bottle of bourbon, 1/5 of bourbon of football games. And the guys with rock around with, um, trays of the plastic stadium cups. Yep, yep, with coconut. And they would yell mixers, mixers. And that's what I remember about college was the, You know, you bring your own mixture. Toe makes what? The bourbon. I mean, they weren't selling. They weren't selling soda. They were selling mixers like a bourbon. That's exactly right. So but But everybody drink bourbon, And that's kind of my first memory. And I've really thought about that for a while. It was a great It's just what you did. Yeah, it's fun, right? Yeah. Yeah. Nice way. Weren't real sophisticated about it. And there was a bourbon and Virginia called old Virginia gentlemen, and you can still buy it today. but that's kind of the national drink of the school. Virginia Gentleman Bourbon. And to this day, I love Virginia. Gentlemen, some nice. Very nice. I like it. All right, so So I don't know if we should let him off the hook that easily. Actually, story continues. I heard this. This man might have some history, a little bit history, a little bit of knowledge. Lucky enough to have found it. Company called Highways distiller in. So that was about 15 years ago. Um, so I I knew I liked to bourbon, but I didn't really know I liked it. I visited Kentucky and my wife and I went to a wedding. And as a side, we went to maker's mark because we were living in Northern California. The time we like Napa. Yep. And kind of like your journey. We thought, Well, why not go to a distiller? Because we've never been the one. So we went to maker's mark. That's where she and I looked at each other and said, You know, we should make bourbon, so that's and you may have s o. I gotta interrupt here. Utah, right? Is that really live in Park Shin quick, quickly interruption only because on the way, home from the Caribbean maker's mark turns out to be exactly in between the Caribbean and Hawaii. Really? And we also stopped at Maker's mark to see whether this distillery thing was really gonna be for us or not. And after a visit to Maker's mark, we were just absolutely sold. It's sold. It was done. Maker's mark is what did it for us. The Kentucky Distilleries Air, If you haven't been, I have not been yet. It is something on my list to be on your own. Yeah, it's magical. Their national treasures. We visited in 2001. I don't know if you know, here's a random fact. Yeah, Yeah. We love those here. Her capita consumption of alcohol in United States. Do you know when it's all time, Lois? After Prohibition, I'm guessing well or dirty. Fair enough after Prohibition. Do you know when it's all time low? Okay, okay. I don't have going off Hit an all time low in Prohibition. You're right. Yeah, that's a fair point. Its all time lows in 1996 and per capita consumption was bottom. And why's that? Um, in the seventies. I peeked in 78 wasn't it? Because that Tom Cruise movie okay, they get a lot of people are drinking. It peaked in 78 Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the three martini launch and all that stuff. Oh, yeah, Health consciousness came into being, And so it started tanking 96 maybe 98 at all time low. We went to Maker's mark in 2001 and that night we said, you know, we're gonna do it. So I started doing my homework and I found that out. But it was on the upward trend. And when you ride the upper turn, we figured that might be a good time to start. It was a good time. So there you go. Yep, get it at the bottom and right into the bottom. And you may and you're apparently very humble here as well, Which I told us Well, I might have won an award or two. I think I've heard this because there weren't that many people competing when we did it. So now there's a lot of his 2016 again. He's humble. We'll know when we when we started high West, it was 2005 there were 50 deslauriers United States. There's 2000 right now. Wow. So I wouldn't I wouldn't want to be competing right now. I'm glad you're doing it. Not me. Just wait. I thought you were I thought you were with us on this. Well, I mean, I'm with you ish. I'm with you. I want to help. Well, we're here on site to talk about rum, and I honestly am super excited to talk about this. I'm telling you guys a little bit about this. Rum had always kind of been when I drank, which was rare leading up to as anyone knows, my journey. All the most listeners know. If not, go back and listen. Old episode, you'll figure it out. Um, but, you know, I did not drink much, but when I did, I loved my fruit, fruit drinks. And I especially loved rum. Actually, I went to a tasting. It was on quiet. Ah, and I had a rum tasting there, and I was drinking a man. I think was the first time I could actually connected the dots and realized that rum is from sugar sugar cane. Well, I mean, I'm you guys gonna correct me on this? I'm being very generous. That's right. All room has to be made from sugar cane. Okay, but not just sugar. But it has to come from sugar cane. Yeah, but if I understand correctly, it's not as pure as I thought it was. Which is just take the sugar cane and go. There's a whole process and everything else that goes through this. But I would just to me that the light went off in, like, got a wicked sweet tooth. I love my sweets. Not a shocker. Surprise. I would enjoy rum and not that It's sweet, but I don't know. I just think, you know, it's sugar based. It's guaranteed to be my drink there. So ever since the start of this podcast, I've been wanting to do an episode on rum. And now here we are. And we're talking about rum and so, like that I'm super excited to be here. I'm super excited to be doing this, and I think we're doing it in the perfect place here again on the island. Hawaii. I know the perfect place, is it not? What's your favorite room? Did you say you had a favorite movie. I do not have a favorite rum. Maybe by the end of this episode, I might have already had a couple of years. What's that In my liquor? I actually have Mount Gay. No, I don't. I'm sorry. Although with the recommendation, I might have to try it. I have one. And I again it's on the I'm. And it is bad of me to forget it. It's on the island of quiet. You guys might know. Hello? Uh, yes, thank you. I had I had a bottle of that after I wouldn't did the tasting there, Bought a bottle home work that for a while I also have a bottle at home. It was a gift to me. It's what I would say. It's a 20 year age. It's out of Costa Rica post to be amazing. And I'm saving it for the right occasion. That kind of pop that bottle open and drink some of that. So those are probably that the two that I actually have in my collection I don't have a I actually have a growing collection. Um, all right. And that's what I got in there right now. What's your go to liquor. Attn. The moment it's Scotch I founded love for Scotch. Glenfiddich. Uh, delicious. Yes. Oh, yes. And then, actually, I I think my favorite favorite is I take the little tangent here, but that's all right. I'll take the Glenfiddich Capital Amaretto in there. It's the God a godfather. And now it's like, My God, it is. It's a cocktail. Do you put ice on it? I actually, normally there's ice. I like to drink it straight. Scotch got an amaretto, and it's about to third Scotch to about 1/3 Amaretto and the amaretto. It's that all Mundy kind of Swedish, and it just kind of takes it. Just smoothed it out. Just I mean, I won't do this. I only deal with the 12 year I want to with the 15 plus what? Every year. But with the 12 year just it's that's, that's, like, kind of my go to cocktail. That sounds kind of good, actually. Yeah, so anyway, so that's on doing it. So Ron Simpson, Oreo, What is that Ron Shit scenario? The Costa Rican wrong? Is that what it is? Okay, also is only one. There's there's only one, and that's it. Okay? I I just I remember I got it. And I was I couldn't read the people quite honestly. And I was trying to figure out they were you. What? No, it was it was a gift again. And so I was looking at and I couldn't quite tell what was new was a bottle of alcohol. I just didn't know quite what alcohol it waas. Oh, because it was Spanish. He Well, he wasn't drunk. Just blurry vision. Yeah, I did need the glasses. Perhaps in the moment, but no. And then you know what on means. Rum. What is it? Ron means run Oron. Yeah, OK, Yeah. And because I didn't say rum on the bottle And I think it did say you pointed on it did say Ron says it in Spanish. That's right. Yes. So yes. So again, I once it was explained to me, I was very excited. I think you need to open that soon as you go home. Good. What runs? Not for saving. I'm just That's a deal. I don't know what I will do that I get home tomorrow. So Wednesday night What happens if you die? You know, you do drink the good stuff first, right? You don't get to taste. So you should take a 21 year old 20 I think was 20 was 20 year old and then And then once it's open, it oxidizes. So you might as well keep drinking it to just drink back. Because the thought of you saving that bottle after you've opened it for the years to come. Does that hurt you a little bit? No, no, no. It's gonna change. Okay, so it won't be as good. Okay, once you start getting down on the level, there's more oxygen in there, which destroys. If they're saying I want to drink it within two years, okay? That you open a bottle drink more than two within two year. Okay, that's that's better than I've heard. And not as bad as I started to think When you told. Because I kind of heard you can open it and keep it almost indefinitely. A lot of people know that you can't do that, and it depends. It depends on how old it is. It, like a lot of older ones, won't last long. And it depends on the air in your bottle. and how much air is in the bottle and okay, And is this true? Pretty much most all alcohol, All hard alcohol wines. Obviously. Go fast. Go. They have a shelf life. Okay, I did not know that. Okay, that's good, because they don't have a show. But you started making me worry that it was like a matter of days or weeks, but so you got years. But then again, too. It's just going to deteriorate in the two years. Get it, open it on when they should probably gone by Thursday. That's why I'm here. I'm just saying, if you want your LDL is toe benefit, you right? It's all. It's all medicinal. That's what it's there for. We're here for that. Well, I'm super excited. So let's talk about rum and what it is because, uh, again, I've gotten so far as sugar cane, which has been confirmed yet, but but what else? How would you really kind of talk about or describe rum? Other? I mean, what little I know, but again, it's in your most tropical drinks. It's made from sugar cane, and it's delicious. That's that's my extent. So the first distinction with all spirits is if it's distilled at 95% or higher, meaning the output of this still is 95% alcohol. It's going to be either a neutral spirit or vodka, so it doesn't matter what it started with because the point is, if you're just capturing alcohol, it's it's either of our car and neutral spirit. Okay, anything less 94% or less It comes out of this still, then gets categorized by based on what your starting ingredients were interesting. Starting ingredients means what were the ingredients that you added yeast to to create the fermentation. Okay, so a lot of people don't realize this, but the alcohol is created during the fermentation process. So that's what beer, spirits and wine all have in common is they're all fermented. You start with some substance, usually in leftover agricultural product that has sugar in it, and you add yeast and the east eats up the sugar and converts it into a CO two and alcohol okay, and then in the spirits world. Then we'll take a wine or a beer, so whiskey is actually just beer distilled. It's not terrific beer, typically, really, but there's no reason why it can't be terrific. Beer. Actually guess that kind of makes sense when I think about because it's literally made from the same grains quite often. Right. Then you register this still, and then you pick the best parts of it and turned it into It's just real quick. I'm sorry. I'm not only that, you just blew my mind a little. I want to do so. It's It's a similar grains it It's a different year. It or it doesn't even need to be a different yeast. Okay, process, it goes. The only difference, technically is thatyou distilled it. You started with a beer, so it's still beer bit's still beer. You didn't let it get to the point where it starts. Randy Jackson distilled wines. Yeah, I knew that on the distilled wines. And we still needed episode on brandy and cognac says they're delicious. But anyway, okay. Interesting. I did not know that. Okay. All right, carry on. I'm gonna run out of whisky. Well, this is a gentleman is made out of here. Comes from fermented grain, right? Uh huh. Yep. For men and grain, you ferment corn. You have a beer. If you ferment barley. You have a beer? If you ferment Ryan, have a beer. Yeah, but you also have a whiskey or well, then if you distill it, you get whiskey. So yeah, Or two. Still it even further. You get a vodka or some kind of Ah, no, actually, the way. You just still it will determine the alcohol that comes out of it. Got it? So if you have ah, if you have a type of a still that's designed to capture essentially only the alcohol than that, will you do that on purpose? Because you're trying to get a neutral grain spirit or you're trying to get a, ah, vodka out of that. So the point is, is vodkas and Nutri grain spirits are basically ethanol, huh? Water down to whatever proof they want to serve it up. Nice. Typically, it's 40% alcohol and 60%. Whatever your local waters. Yeah. So that's something to think about when you spend lots of money on a really good vodka. 60% of that is your local water. And the rest of it is ethanol. Okay, also. Okay, though. So I'm sorry to take us on that tangent, but that was again. That would right. So the difference. See, rum is so where rum comes in is now 94% or lower. Coming out of the still, that means at least 6% or more is gonna be some flavor. Okay, Some of the stuff that was in the still that isn't just the alcohol is also coming out. Okay. Got you. Because the more you distill it, the more you're taking everything out and clean. Like said, the things that give it flavor, like a straight whiskey, which becomes a bourbon is required to be at least 20% alcohol coming out, because in orderto have it taste good. You gotta have some flavor. And the only way you're gonna get the flavors to let some of that beer come through as well makes sense. 20% alcohol, no. 80% alcohol coming out of the cell a t A b v, um, and then sew with rums. Anything are 94% or lower is now a rum. If you started with Sugar King. Okay. Um, if you started with a Gavi, it's tequila. If you started with the grain, it's gonna be a whiskey. And if you started with grapes. It's gonna be a brandy or in a movie or fruit. It is also a new TV, so that's basically the main spirit categories. Awesome bod could could be made from anything because it comes at such a high proof. So they even make vodka, for example, out of milk. Yeah. Oh, I didn't know what a milk. I didn't learn along my journeys here that I just always think those potatoes right. That's what you most believe. Most of the world's Bach has actually made from wheat and that the Russian recipe is wheat. Is it okay that they like us, have a surplus of week? Okay, Yeah, and I did. I did not know that I did not know from milk, but it's again. It's just a matter of when there's a guy, a feller in Wisconsin that makes it from milk. Interesting, because it's got sugar in it. Lack toes. Yeah, and you can leave it to Wisconsin for some with that milk. And And if you think about it, that's actually how spirits got started in the first place. Is any leftover agricultural products that had no value as food people figured out that the yeast didn't care and it would convert. It's alcohol. And everybody seems to like that, actually, even going further back if we want to get really random yet, let's do this. There's a famous agriculturalists. Is it a guy at the University of Pennsylvania that put out a theory that civilizations started when a man or woman discovered fermentation? You know that I have done this in a civilized yes, because what happened is they all kind of went It takes more to do it proper and large scale takes more than a A person or a small group of people don't have to settle down. And just one place You can't be nomadic because you have to settle down. You have to have a community, and you have to have an abundance of crops. Yes, that now can actually go toe waits. Well, no, it wasn't about the abundance. It was about man settled down in the first civilization in order to ferment. Yes, so because the first pottery shards that they found with residues of alcohol corresponded with the really civilization. And there's a surgery, and I think it's in Maryland that actually great doctors actually scraped the inside pottery from Egyptian barrels to figure out how they were making rare. Yeah, yeah, I've heard that. I've heard trade. A lot of trade was driven by that, too, because it was all trade around alcohol and that that's why people, that's when people started trading and moving and going to going back and forth. So, yeah, I have heard that message Catania were even in China, in the cities in China, where same time is, and also to like your again. We're nerdy, not here. But that's all right. We love it if you get back to that. That's if you look at the locations that you're saying, Mr Potato and some of those were the prime locations to grow the right ingredients to make the alcohol. So yeah, yeah, it all kind of it's It's all theoretical, but I think there's a lot of a lot of truth in that, to Steve's point, that the excess one, like the colonists in America if they had excess turnips, excess pumpkins, they distilled everything right. And in fact, Rai Rai was kind of Ah, a reply. I'm being gentle to their British when they cut ties with him saying we don't need your recipes. We're gonna make our whiskey out of right now because that was something that was very American at the time. I did not know that. Okay, nice. All right. I think we're gonna make our alcohol at a ride because it was wrong. Well, Ron was definitely thinks Yes. Oh, so there's a great book called and a Bottle of Rum by Wayne Curtis. I think it is. Um, it's a fantastic book, but in that basically two big fax come out of that one is the American colonies were all making rum, and lots of rum were being made at the time. But more importantly, is that rum is actually what paid for the entire American Revolution. Oh, I did not know that. It's a great book, and I highly recommend you reading it. And that's actually kind of it's a good segue way to what we're doing here. Yes, it's because a lot of people rum did originate in the Caribbean and the sugar industry, which lead lead tow. The creation of rum started in the Caribbean around the 15 hundreds, but what's interesting is the sugar did not start in the Caribbean. So it turns out sugar cane is actually from the Pacific Ocean. So sugar cane started 10,000 years ago in Papua New Guinea. Come. And for the last 3000 years it's been traded around the Pacific Ocean with Polynesian Way finders and navigators and Voyager's because the while the Romans decided that they were gonna conquer most of the world and then lose it all had 3000 year period. The Polynesians were actually traveling around the entire and settling all the islands of Polynesia. Interesting. And they were doing it with little or no, um, technology, technological tools. They basically had a way of understanding how the skies and the seas and the oceans and the currents and the birds and everything worked in order to figure out how to figure out where new Islands were. Yeah, and then not only be able to get there, but then to come back with everything they needed to start a civilisation and to thrive. Yep. Wait, how did how did the shirt can't get to the Caribbean? So one single variety of sugar cane from new question just random. I'm guessing it was discovered by the Chinese. Okay, Probably through some voyaging, huh? And then they quietly sort of figured out how to make sugar in isolation. And then, as the conquest from the West would sort of go to the east, they would take these radical technologies like these guys have sugar. You should You should check this stuff out. It's pretty cool. And she slowly made its way west. Wait, So sure can travel west. Not East. Yes, West all the way around the world. Well, not all the way around the world to Europe. So the Europeans? Yeah, West from Papa, New Guinea, through Europe, Overland War after war and conquest After conquest, they would steal the sugar and take it. And then they and the technology in the single variety of Papa New Guinea sugar cane was discovered with my quotation marks in the air. Bye. I can't remember a king of England, and he basically helped make sure that the Caribbean was made available to them to plant this single variety of cane and from that grew so well that they started the sugar industry. There's there's two really important byproducts of the sugar industry, one waas, and I'm not gonna say cavities, one waas molasses, huh? Um and then too was run. So when this molasses this first time, they had these great stores of molasses just lying around, Um, and molasses is what's left over after you process out all the white sugar. And so some of those news to me because I and always imagine it's made from the sugar cane or whatever. Well, it iss, yes, but it gets back to what you were saying before where a lot of the alcohol gets made from what's left over. Right, right, right. It's always made from what's left over. So I'm imagine these pure sugar canes. And apparently it's like this molasses almost kind of a So molasses is not the last thing. Is all of the flavor removed from the sugar cane plant? Literally. Yeah, And then the only thing. So they take all the sucrose out and turned it and crystallize it and sell that as a pure form of sucrose. And then the molasses is sitting there and and somebody noticed in one of those huts that it was bubbling and they knew what that meant and then quietly started making rum out of it. until they got discovered, and then rum literally, then took over. So then processing white sugar became, at some point, a byproduct of rum production. That's right. You had to make a white sugar to get the molasses, the bank so they continue to make the white sugar because there's a great market for people loved it. But rum is actually where the money was. A primary process, all of us, that it suffered in history classes in the seventies and eighties, about the Molasses Act and the Sugar Act and all these other acts there euphemisms for actually controlling the rum trade. Interesting, OK, and so that's a rum actually became the number one spirit, certainly in the United States and huge spirit throughout Europe. And in the end, the West in general, was it was massive. And so a lot of these islands, if you look at their histories, the French took it over, and then the English ticket over. And then the Americans tried. And so that's why the Caribbean is so fractured and split up, and sometimes you can't even agree whether it's you know, one of those islands is part Dutch and part French in fact, two of them are right. The other one is French and French and Spanish. Thank you matter So meanwhile, though, So how do we know that for sure came from because we're working with this guy named Noah Lincoln who had his PhD out of, uh, he's now out of university of why he's a professor at University of Boy. And he got his PhD at Stanford studying the Hawaiian field system that occurred for the last 1000 years. So the first Hawaiians showed up 1000 years ago, and on their canoes, they brought plants they knew were essential to culture. The best guess is there's probably two varieties of Hawaiian sugar canes that they brought with them, and from those two over 1000 years in isolation, the wine's cultivated a 40 different varieties. Okay, yeah, and so. And to get to this a little bit, because I it's all making sense. What I want ask a little bit. So I know you guys were doing something different that you mentioned where it's like the 3% only 3% of do it. So what would a normal kind of what's the path for? Maybe a normal room. And then what are you guys doing that that's more different and unique? The easiest way to make rum is well, It used to be to make it from molasses, so the vast majority of the world's room was still made from molasses. And molasses is a product that's stable. It could be put in buckets. It's highly concentrated, and it can sit for months, if not a year or two without much attention. Um, and then what you do is you'll add some water and you'll dilute it and you'll adjust the pH and then you'll boil it and do all these things that other distilleries do when they're making their matches to create, Ah, liquid that basically approximates sugar cane juice. Okay, and then you add yeast. And then here's a little side thing, So whoever has yeast should take up. Take your yeast out of the cupboard and look at it. And if it's a sacrum icy service A. Which most of your yeast will say, that means little sugar cane critters. Well, it turns out most of the East that's in production in the world for bread and baking and other things is actually all from sugar cane. Interesting. So, in the whisky world, did you get to use sugar cane east? Did you sacrifice? He surveys say everybody. Yeah. So basically, yeast is actually looking for sugar cane. To which, which part of it means a little sacrifice ceases sugar and service A means little critters Greek. Damn, I didn't know that. I did not know that. Okay, So basically, everybody who ferments anything is actually trying to Well, not wind, but most, most most beers and most alcohol's. They're trying to actually make sugar cane shoes, because that's what the yeast is looking for. So when we decided we wanted to make Rome Agricole cause the friend and I'm gonna back up a little to make sure I understand. So So they get the molasses? Yep. And that some water. And then they had something so basic. It's almost like they're trying to reverse the process. A little bit of back to the exactly sugar came exactly. Use extractor. Whatever. You have to adjust the ph. And then they have this. Actually, one of the things in front of you is actually fresh sugarcane shoes. Okay, I'm gonna try this. This This is seconds for a minute. This'll fresh sugarcane juice fermented. And this is the Cool Yana age from That's not that fresh sugarcane. Jeez Oh, this is just so we make a run from that. That's just a pure juice. Taesa. Oh, and it's not. It's so It's not delicious, right? It's very dosa, and it's not. It's just straight juice. See, I would I would. He could see why. It's delicious. It is. Yeah. So you could see why, If you're 1000 years ago and they hadn't invented Coca Cola vending machines, it's like sugar one. Somebody offers you that any better yet, A lot of friends. If you're in control of that stuff, I would have all the friends they made. Sure. When the Polynesian showed up here, they made sure that they brought some of those plants to okay. Obvious reasons. Okay, so and so that's the kind of the that's what juice right there. That's what you That's what you want. So everybody additional everybody else tries to make their working backwards to get to that? Yes. And then what you guys were doing, we were We couldn't believe how lucky we were because we figured out what everybody else needed in their fermentation. Sze. And then So then when we figured out the pH in the temperature and the bricks levels and all those things and we started doing tests on our own sugar cane juice and everything was perfect and we thought, What are the chances that it's perfect? Until we realized the whole sacrifices service a connection? We put it together that actually yeast is looking for sugar cane juice. So we thought, Okay, we're done. Yeah, this is gonna be super easy. Wait, Hold on. Now, kind of yeast isn't just looking for sugar cane. Well, if it's sacrifice and service, say it. ISS in the open idea of fermentation attorney, which makes that sugar toe alcohol, they're eating it. They know what's cool about it. That when it when it actually becomes alcohol is like the rest of us in a sugary substance. They'll multiply because they've got everything they need and they're happy and they multiply when actually becomes. Alcohol is when they actually run out of oxygen. So when yeast runs out of Oxygen III in a fermentation tank or with so many yeast competing in the liquid at the same time that the oxygen is depleted, then what yeast can do that super special is they can tear apart the sucrose molecule and take oxygen out of it to feed themselves the oxygen on the byproduct of them. Staying alive by eating the oxygen is that's that split is it creates ethanol and CO. Two interesting, so it doesn't mean to do that. But when it's in distress or when there's so much yeast around that it's become super committed, that's where the alcohol actually gets created. And I love my Scotch. I love a good wine, but it seems to me it's all going after the sugar. So Rahm is pretty Well, let's just start with the sugar and call it done right. Yeah, And the job of every plan on Earth is actually to convert sunlight into sugar. So sugar cane just does it more successfully than most. So we've talked a lot of room today, and there's a life like a lot more to talk about before, you know, we're done here, Correct? Yeah. Do we have another hour way? Need like another five hours, I think. But what we'll do is we'll go ahead with this could be a two parter, So join us next week. Come in, listen, and you can learn a lot more about rum. There's, I think, again, a whole lot more to talk about. So until next time we're at the end. Sophisticated palate dot com Tell your friends Let's give the website for years. We'll do a little bit more at the next episode, but if they want to reach out to you now, how would they find you at juliana rum dot com? That's spelled k u l e a n a rum dot com. Excellent. So, until next time, drink responsibly. Cheers, Cheers."

This week Marc is joined by Scott, the Winemaker at Thumbprint Cellars, to discuss the varietal from how it is grown to how it is used for blending to how it can stand on its own. Along the way we talk art, balance, and his journey. So pour yourself a glass and Cheers!

Welcome to the unsophisticated palate. A podcast about all things wine, beer and spirits. Join us each week as we drink and delve into different alcohol related topics. I'm Mark and I'm Scott. Cheers. Cheers. Oh, that is delicious. That's everything you promised. Very good. No, thank you. Yeah. The 2015 Sera from Knights Valley is, uh it's a very different style sera then than what a lot of people are interested. In fact, this is more of a classic style of Cote Rotie style sera. A little more than I say. What does that mean? Well, in in Cote Rotie, in in France, Sera is made with and co fermented with Vienna. It's a style that picks up, helps pick up the acidity from the Vienna and really round off the Surat. So it's just not a big bruiser. It's actually, um, or sophisticated style on. And you can even say it could be unsophisticated. You go well for palates like mine. Perhaps, But again, I'm learning more and more. And we like the sophisticated stuff. We're just trying to learn a lot more about it, I think. Yeah. And you know, and I agree. I think They're one of the most important things that we get. Our guests, too, realizes it doesn't matter what the points are. How many gold medals it has when you come in here to taste in the thumbprint tasting lounge. It's what you like. Do you like it? That's a CZ. Unsophisticated as it gets to me. Yeah, well, and that's our kind of model. Here. Drink what you like, right? So yes, you're right. It doesn't. All the other stuff doesn't matter. But I guess we should say who we are. S O Scott. Welcome. You are the winemaker Eyes that the official title. Well, yes, I actually promoted myself to director of winemaking operations. Nice. So I direct the wine making Now, at the ripe age of over 50 and 25 harvests under my belt. My body has taken a toll just to so few harvests. So I'm letting the young guys do all that on all the work. And I say, guys with the young team, we have two women on staff this year as well that are helping at harvest. And that's here. A thumbprint Sellers in Healdsburg. Very happy to be back. So we're glad to have you back on. Thanks for making the time. Because this is gonna not be released. So I think it would be a few weeks before release. But we're right, or you're right. I say we like it's me too. You're welcome to join us. I trust I'll let the young guys okay. Yeah, do that Smart. But I write the middle of harvest right now. So, uh, thanks. Appreciate you making the time. And this is kind of a crazy time of year, right? Yes, definitely. And this is, Ah, about a normal harvest for us where we're getting the crush of it. The crunch, the bulk. Most of the grapes air coming in toward the end of September. Uh, the last couple harvests have been a little early where most of the harvest was done early September. We had a wet winter and a mild summer. So everything has kind of balanced out, and we're getting a little extra hang time and just extraordinary flavors and looking like another great harvest here in Sonoma County. So that's a good thing then, right? That's a good thing. I always wonder because it's like I mean is, you know, what's good and what's bad, right, because it could make a big difference. Absolutely. And I've always said it's kind of like cheating to be a winemaker in Sonoma County because of the micro climates and the weather in the soil. Everything that that we have as faras winemaking is kind of set up for us to be successful before it even comes into the winery. Great growers that are growing amazing wine quality grapes in just the right locations. Yeah, and it's a great climate. It's pretty. I mean, of course there's, you know, the heats in the droughts, and there's always the years, but as a whole, it's It's pretty consistent, I would think right. And when I heard yes, absolutely typically no rain or very little rain from June through October, which is our harvest season. Rain can create an abundance of problems for us, and, uh, and it doesn't get so hot and stay hot. We'll have our typical weather summer weather pattern where it will heat up for three or four days, and then it will cool down. And then, of course, every night it cools into the fifties and sixties, so you get the grapes to cool down. So they're not constantly under pressure of heat. It's become such a well, I mean, well known regions worldwide. I mean, I'm trying to think, I mean, it's really for California, but even for the United States, and I mean, it's rivals and has rivaled and one against many of the other eye wine growing climates in the world. So great place to be absolutely. And, you know, ask me. I'm a little biased. Obviously. I grew up in the Bay Area from a young age, have been coming to Healdsburg as kid then as a wine appreciation fanatic and then to just being immersed in the industry. Yeah, yeah, I love it. I still keep trying to find a reason that, like, live here and nothing You need a reason. You know, I think you need maybe you don't need excuse. Maybe I just needed to do it right? Yeah. Come on up. All right. I love it. Um, well, I want to talk a little bit, too. Before we dive in, we are gonna talk about cab Franck today, the great, the varietal and all the wonderful things about it. But first I've I've heard a few things about your history here. And I want to kind of confirm or deny and or get some of the stories. That sounds fascinating. Okay, so my understanding you are self taught. You just kind of decided. Hey, this wine thing looks cool. I think I'm going to do it. Is that true? More or less. Yes. Um, I was in college, and ah had the opportunity to study art history in Florence over the summer between my junior and senior year and came back just absolutely. Mind blown with what? I had seen my first exposure to this and talking with my folks and seeing their grapes ripening in their front yard. I thought also, I'm going to make wine. There's some negotiations. We decided that I'd get a couple of garbage cans full. Uh, I could make them turn the grapes into wine in my garage. Okay. Andi trusted you with a Well, they said their Their thought was just stay out of the way and you can do your thing. Okay. Eso It started as a hobby in our garage. My wife bought me a book. How to make wine in your garage. Kind of thumb break. Wait, right. You know how not to mess it up was kind of my thought. The first vintage turned out pretty decent. We bottled it and drank most of it. And the holidays came around. So we thought, Let's share it with our friends and family. So I started Thio, put your paper labels on him, and my wife said No, no, no. Let's here. I got you one of these gold pens. Do something. You're an art major. Do something. Are the Arctic right? Yeah. So I read the writing on the pendant, Says, shake vigorously. So I'm shaking and shaking and pushed Tip in and I'm shaking. And I'm like, Wow, what am I gonna do? That's artistic? I have no idea how long I was shaking the pen. When I pushed the tip in, the ink just exploded out of the pen. Yes. Oh, it's dripping off trying to drip off the bottle and threatening to drip onto the countertop. So I'm kind of now mopping it up with my thumb so it won't drip off the counter, and I'm well, that's artistic, right? It's kind of big Splash. Yeah. Looked a little obvious that been an explosion there, but yes. So you're mopping it. Also, I'm mopping it up, and now I've got it on my thumb, and I inadvertently stuck it on one of the other bottles and it left this gold thumbprint. So I kept mopping and putting my thumbprint on. And, like, I meant to do it or something. So we showed that the party give the wine away to our friends, and, um, they drank it right then and there. And we're asking for more of that thumbprint wine. Oh, so you know, the name went on. Uh, just this was your first batch. You're saying? Yeah, this was the very final that they're already asking for more. So you said it was pretty good or decent. So I'm thinking like, all right, you did okay and perfected over time. Apparently, it was good enough. They're coming back for more. Your first badge? Yeah. Well, next year I had to sell it to him, so Well, you know, I'm doing air quotes on cell, too. Yeah, it ended up being from a hobby turned passion at that point. Nice. That is awesome. I always like to kind of hear the different stories and actually which now make it seem, also realize we're all over, which is totally fine. That's what we do all the time. But we also like to cover first time we have somebody on kind of your history of relationship with alcohol. I don't know if we just did that or if there's something different. You kind of want to share around that true story. It actually started when I was about 10. As the youngest sibling in our family, at our big formal dinners, Beit Holiday meal or somebody's Birthday. My role was to open the wine that we're going to pour for the year old. So with that came, you know, had to polish the glasses, and so so they were kind of grooming me to be a soma at that point, Um, so I would do this and and I would, you know, get a little sample of each of the bottles that I opened. So I quickly realized that if I poured all the wine to everybody and open another bottle, I'd get another sip. Okay, so So fight by 11 or 12. I was realizing, you know, that cab didn't go that well, with salmon last time. Maybe we should try that with the filet mignon instead. And so I was making recommendations, and sometimes they listen. Sometimes we're having salmon anyway, um, and over the years coming up here, uh, with friends, we realized what a great spot this was. And and heels Berg is now where my folks have retired and they have a small vineyard in front of their place, which eyes fun to play around with. And, yeah, we we've been through a lot of different incarnations and, well, that's awesome. That's that's a fun story. Live and I like, I think I find a lot of the people that and I kind of said some weird things before that manage either that just manager alcohol well, and or kind of really find that passion, skill, whatever. They come into it young like that. And it's not this mystery. It's not this thing that, you know the parents are hiding from them or whatever. And then 21 you know, you're magically not gonna drink 21. You're magically going to start drinking and B perfectly responsible and all the other kind of stuff, So I think that exposure when you're young makes a big difference. And apparently on the palate as well for you anyway. Yeah. So, um, the other interesting thing that happened as growers, my folks were allowed Ah, decent grower percentage off line that they purchased from the wineries that they supplied the grapes Thio. Okay, so the old, um send me with a note to go get wine at the wine shop downtown. You where they were in their on their list to get their discount. Yeah. And so I show up one day with with, you know, I'm picking up wine for my folks and they said, Oh, would you like to taste while we're putting that together for you? And at the ripe age of 18 I realized to say Yes, I d'oh. So from from there on, I became kind of a regular at the tasting rooms, and you're granted This was 30 some years ago, where you know, if you're going through the steps, if you're doing the the swirl, sip and spit. Ah, and listening to the hosts that were pouring wine for you and having them give you the details about malolactic fermentation and and why this red wine is so dynamic and really just wanting to learn more about wine as I waas it became more of an education to me and an opportunity to refine my palate. Yeah, yeah, and it's no surprise now, hearing all this that your first batch was great and just continued to get veteran better over time. So that's awesome. Yeah. Continue to impart Maur ideas of quality, working closer with the growers to make sure that they understand what we're looking for in the grape quality. So then we can translate that into the higher quality of the wine. Now that I want to make Yeah, now of the wines that you guys make here and you've got several word thoroughly enjoying the sirah right now. I was here previously with Josh and we did a tasting. We went through several, but the ones you guys were Really I think you're most proud of our most well known for. I don't know how you would verbalize that. I'll let you do that. But is the cab frog? Yes. So tell me about that and why that grape Well, cabernet franc is one of the five board over idols So you've got cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc, petite Bordeaux and malbec. And I make all five of those as stand alone's, and I make them to blend as well. They're somewhat accessible here in Soma County because of the different soil and microclimates that we have available. But Thibodeau and Malbec, or a little bit more scarce. But cabernet franc has actually been a very popular blending varietal for decades. I first had an opportunity to pick a small amount of that when I started my home. Winemaking. We've been playing with it since the get go. About my third year, I started making a little bit of cabernet frog and my first commercial vintage. I had just enough that I thought I was going to blend in. So I brought samples of the cab frog, the merlot in the cabernet sauvignon home to ask my wife to help, you know, we were going to blend it. We're going to come up with our first Meritage blend. Okay? Yeah. Oh, but I can't say meritage because we're not part of the Meritage Society Meritage type Bordeaux style Bordeaux style. Okay, There you go. The Bordeaux style blend. Yes. Uh, and she tastes the straight cab frog. And she said, Oh, yeah, I like this one. And I said, Well, that no, that's just a component that's blended into the Bordeaux style. Bled Well, can't we just make it like that just by itself? And I kind of rolled my eyes and I'm thinking it's gonna take more work, but sure, Yeah, absolutely. So we went on and finishing the blend, and I promised that I was going to make her 100% cabernet Franck, which I did hold 25 cases of it. She probably consumed about half of it, and I should say we wage and overtime. I'm assuming not in a week. Yeah, Overtime. Absolutely. But it instantly became her favorite varietal. It became a challenge for me to continue to make cab Franck in a classic style made from the grapes that were getting here in Sonoma County and by classics gonna happen and enjoy, right? Yeah, absolutely. But no classic style. You're saying Yes. So in the classic style, again unsophisticated, we get a cabernet franc varietal grapes here in Sonoma County that are grown to a little bit more ripe nous than you traditionally get in Bordeaux, so different parts of France. Bordeaux is probably the premier cabernet franc producer. There's another little, uh, region near Loire Valley called Shannon, and she known has a very different style. It's a little bit Maur acid driven, okay, and it gives you a bit more mouth feel a little bit more texture. It makes the wine more dynamic. So rather than ripening our cab Franck to this unbelievable, you should, uh, just a phenomenal big style. Yeah, because we can. Showing a bit of restraint and having some artistry behind the craftsmanship of it is shows so much more character in the wine. Overall, obviously, where it's a fruit driven cabernet franc, it traditionally has a little bit of a green character, the chemicals called pirate scene. If you want to be a little bit more sophisticated to understand that, and instead of hiding that we we use that as as a part of the complexity of the cabernet franc varietal. And I think that it's one of the reasons why our cabernet front really stands out because I'm being true to the classical style of the varietal. Nice, Nice. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the writer or the grape itself. What is? Because I know they all kind of have there things that are unique about it, right? A little thicker skin, little bigger grape, A little different cluster. So what about cab? Franck is unique and makes it cab from Well, it's actually the one of the parent varietals of cabernet sauvignon. So you've got cabernet Franck and Sauvignon Blanc, somewhere back in Roman time, blended together. And as as grape varietals on the stock, they would have grafted them together. And you've got this new varietal called Cabernet Sauvignon so interesting and the reason Yeah. And the reason that they were doing that was to try to eliminate that green character that was so predominant in cabernet. Franck Okay, What they didn't realize was, if you just ripe in it a little bit more if you're judicious about your leaf pulling during harvest. So in other words, not having too much canopy, you won't get a big vegetative characteristic in that varietal. Obviously, a red grape is a thick skin, small skin clustered. What is it? I mean, I know that's a little semi technol, but I think it kind of helps me anyway, like we didn't episode on piano and was temperamental because they're so close together. So they tend to, I don't know, like affect each other. Whatever. Is there anything? I think that's maybe a little. And I want to talk a little about the taste pro Fox, and that's that's a little bit unique. But the first just the grape itself. And one of it is you're saying it's got that greener flavor, but you're saying some of that you trim back that leaves, and I guess it gets a bit more sun, and it's a little less green and flavor, right? What else can tell about the grape itself? Well, the cluster itself is a medium sized cluster. It's fairly loose, meaning that the Berries aren't very close together. They're not squished together, like zinfandel or Pino Know are. So that does allow a little bit more airflow. Ah, it's which is a little bit more preventative of mildew or bunch rot. It's a fairly hardy varietal grape as well, so it can. It can take adverse conditions. And remember, we're trying to stress the vines just subtly to encourage the deeper complexity in the varietal. So by stressing the vines, of course, the grapes would get a little bit stressed. Thio, Pino and Sera and Zin will actually dimple or raisin under that stress. But cabernet franc, because it's a thicker skin varietal and has a good, pulpy character to it, won't necessarily dimple or raisin. So I won't say it's an easy varietal to grow because of the leaf pulling and the vineyard work that goes into it beforehand. But compared to zinfandel. And, you know, I hear people talk about Pino being difficult as well. Which can be, I think it's, Ah, it's a pretty easy grape to grow here in Cinema County. Okay? And now we've talked a bit about that. So does taste the the greener kind of taste to it. And oddly enough, I that actually kind of makes sense to me when I first, you know, delved into wine and people say greener and you're like, Okay, you know, sure, you know. But I think again it's one of those things, as I've admitted more than once. When I first started drinking, it was like red wine or white wine, right, And that was about complex. My palate was right. But with time, I think you can get to the point where it is greener and again it's It's kind of hard to describe the other than it's just I mean, how would you describe Green? I mean, it's kind of a little less right, or maybe not, right. But I don't know how would you? Yeah. So, um, there's levels of this green character. This pirate scene chemical that is present in and pirate scene is directly related to green bell peppers as well. Okay. Or sometimes green beans. Uh, green cracked pepper will also have this chemical. And remember these these air growing in the fruit, Uh, molecularly. Ah. And you know, during during that process, if it's still present and we pick it, it'll translate pretty much all the way through into the wine. Regardless of how long you agent, it's always gonna have that green character. So I go from green vegetable being the top being most present of the pirate scene into kind of the lower end, which I call her basis. And her bay cious character could be more like sage or on the bottle. I write cannabis because it has a little bit of a earthy cannabis like character, sage, rosemary, Um, even going into a little bit of exotic spice, like maybe cardamom. Okay, so, um, green cardamom pod has a little bit of that very parts per 1,000,000,000 of the pirate scene, but it also has kind of a nice, spicy characteristic as well. And that's actually why I was gonna go next. Because another thing, I think that this grape is no forces. It's peppery or spicy kind of flavor. And my understanding is that's affected by how long you're leaving it on the vine or how you're writing it, right? Whether you get how much spice and what kind of spices that yeah, the spice varietals and I consider cabernet franc a spice varietal for sure. Um, we'll have that coming in the grape now. We can also emphasize that spice varietal with certain oak program that we use because typically when you're talking about a spice like a baking spice or chocolate or cinnamon or vanilla, the were talking about the influence of the barrels on the wine as its aging. Okay. And we wanted to be very subtle again. We don't want it to be so overpowering that all you get is vanilla and you can't really tell what the varietal is. Yeah, so this goes into the artistic balance and artistic approach of winemaking, in my opinion, I mean, that's why you can have the exact same grapes from the eggs almost in the same vineyard or right next to each other. Whatever. And you can have two completely and utterly different wines that don't taste anything alike. Absolutely right. Uh, I could create two different wines from the same grapes that were picked on the same day from the same vineyard. Depends on the style that I'm going for. And we have other winemakers that do pick from the same growers and make very different lines. There's a lot of variables that go into it, and my style could be very different from another winemaker style. Not to say one's better. Oh, yeah, no. Right or wrong? It's preference, right? What? Drink what you like. Yeah, right, Exactly. But it does all kind of come down ultimately. Well, maybe not. Ultimately, you have to have obviously a good crop. Diatta ideally, but really comes down to the wine maker at the end of the day because you can actually have the best crop in the world and tank it right. Or you could have s o so crop and turn it into something pretty good. Yeah, yes, it's definitely easier to make good wine from good grapes. It's, ah, lot harder to make good wine from bad grapes. And then there's the don't screw it up factor. Okay, You know, you can get great grapes. Screw everything up because you're overproducing is typically what I say is you're doing too much to it. So my philosophy has always been to kind of guide the grapes along through fermentation into the aging process and just kind of make sure that they're they're doing what you're wanting them to d'oh! And that's I'm thinking the artist in you there like saying some of the restraint and or not doing too much cause for me. I'm not an artist. I I love to dabble. I love to do it, but you know, I will do something. Then you kind of keep adding or changing or doing something. You got to kind of know when I think to to walk away and not over complicate what you're doing right, right? Well, I studied fine arts in college. One of my first lessons was knowing when to stop. You know, you can keep futzing with that drawing the rest of your life. Or you can say, Yeah, that's good enough. And, you know, put a couple touches on it. You know, in art, like in wine, the aesthetic is what you're looking for. Is it pleasing to look at a piece of art? Because the composition is strong. Is the wine pleasing to drink? Because it's complex and it has depth and character. And, Oh, by the way, it's true to the varietal. Yeah, Yeah, I love that. And then now I gotta ask, is a toll completely sidetracked? But do you still paint our sketch or whatever your art medium is? Well, winemaking has taken over as my main medium for the last 25 years. However, I am dabbling in pottery and ceramics a little bit just to keep me focused on life other than the winery. Yeah. You need to have something else. I would imagine. Absolutely. That's fine. Okay, I just think about that because because it's something like this can will kind of channel. I think a lot of that and gonna keep you very busy, too. So I was just kind of curious if you'd held onto some of that. It sounds like you have to a degree anyway. Yeah, I'd like to be more involved in it this time. A year? I'm less involved in it. Um, and I have times in the off season that that I can be. So it's it's nice to be able to dabble on DDE have that that experience to pull from. Yeah, well, now you're promoted, so, you know, because you promoted yourself, you've got people kind of doing the work. So maybe in a couple of years and step back a little bit more and do more art, right? Yeah. I don't know that the promotion was actually a great thing. And it means I'm spending a lot more time in the office now. Oh, so great. Well, um, it needs to be done. You know, it's it's part of growing up and being an adult ng. We avoid that. I know that. That actually makes sense, right? It does. Okay, so I want to talk a little bit then about because the cab. Franck Uh, and we'll talk a little about that. Stand alone. I think you've talked a lot about what you did that, but it's tradition known as a blending grape. And that's really I think, how I was introduced to it, how most people know it. It's It's also in this one thing, right this blend, or it's used to kind of temper this. So how is it? I guess maybe it is because of the some of the spiciness of the greenest are kind of How would you think of it blending, You know, again, thinking for people like me, right? How would I think about that? Are approaching well, traditionally in a Bordeaux style blend that's cab based. You'd have a little bit of merlot 234 maybe 5% because it really does. Let's start to dominate the characteristic of the wine. In even that small amount, the merlot would act as a um, kind of ah, mid palate enhancer and the vineyard that we source are merlot from. Actually, every year has this outstanding long finish, so I really rely on them, are loaded to extend that that texture that those tannins, the acidity throughout the finish of the of the wine the cab create is is the backbone. Really? We have a big following for our cap, Frank, as we spoke about. So I actually push the amount of cab Franck that I put in my Bordeaux style blend. Okay, because our customers appreciate that and want to taste cab frog. Yeah, even though it it starts to dominate some of the complexities of the wine, it's still not the cab Franck. It still has that backbone from the cab, and the complexity of them are low. But that cab frog comes through and people really like that. So that's a design style that I've put into it and used as a blend that way. I know it's a popular varietal for us, so I'm going to explore it even more. That makes sense. That makes sense. If that's you know, people love it as is, then push. It'll stronger in your blend right now and then the stand alone of that, I think for somebody, and you can correct me if I'm wrong on this and I'm wrong often, so it's okay, but it might if you were new to wine and or just kind of developing your palate or kind of stuck with I don't know more the basic stuff going to a cab franc and be a little strong, overbearing, and I think sometimes. But once you get there, it's like I think it brings a lot more to it. Is there any kind of truth to that? Or what's your thoughts on that? I'm trying to read into the idea of what you're what you're experiencing? And I think in a lot of cases when we're exploring a varietal will go to to our wine shops that have less expensive cabernet from us in this case, you know? So I'm gonna buy some 6 99 bottles of Capt. Frank. I'm gonna try maybe a 12 99 1 from from France. And maybe I'm gonna go wine tasting in Sonoma County. And, boy, I'm going to splurge and buy a 35 or $45 bottle And just compare and contrast the differences between these standalone cab franc's and what you'll typically find out. E you probably already figured this out, but the 6 99 is going to be a little bit mean. It's not gonna have much character to it. It's gonna be wet on your palate. You might know that it's red. Um, it might even be blasting with these pirates. Ing chemicals is this green bell pepper. And typically, what I would call that is a flawed cabernet franc. Okay, It hasn't been grown well, And if it's not grown well, there's nothing you can do to turn it into a good bottle of cabernet franc going in this case, it sounds like and I could be wrong on this, too, so But they're just kind of I mean, there their focus is putting out a lot of inexpensive wine, so they're not paying some attention to, like, we're talking about all the other things that kind of go into all the artistry in it, right? Right, Well, and remember, you've got to consider where this is coming from. So if this 6 99 bottle of cab Franck is says on the label California, it could be only 75% cabernet frog from anywhere in California. Let's let's move forward to the to the when I say 16. 99 bodies. Yeah. Yeah. Now you're getting a little bit Maur varietal character instead of saying California on the label. Maybe it says North Coast. Okay, so now North Coast is a much bigger region. Well, it's a smaller region from California, but it's still pretty large over. All right, so from Mendocino, it could be from Napa. It could be from Sonoma County. It could be from anywhere. What a lot of that I think what Lake County is doing. So Yeah, North Coast is a fairly large Appalachian, not his biggest California. But you're getting grapes from anywhere in that area. Cab Franck would have to be 85% of that bottle, but it could be 10% of anything else. Okay. Again. So and typically it it will be. So you're getting some of the varietal characteristics you're getting some of the green. It may have been toned down on the pirate scene. It might not be blasting you with green pepper, but you might get some of that dill or green bean. And you're thinking Okay, this is definitely better than the 6 99 Yeah. So now we're gonna taste the $47 bottle that I make which says cabernet. Franck, Dry Creek Valley mounts vineyard. And in fact, in the little copy, I even put what block it's from. So this is a one is real quick too, because I learned this. And so some of our listeners are more sophisticated those But the block is the part of the vineyard, Right? To have, like, this block in that block. And that can very, even a little bit, because this one make it a little more sun. And that 1 may be on a little higher or whatever. It may be correct. Yeah, they could be different age. They could be different clones. Um, some wine makers will even put clone four on it or clone one or whatever just to give you Maurin Formacion. And you're taking it. Basically, at this point, if we were the kind of GPS located and you're taking it down to almost the house, right? Right. Yeah, your Google in that little house right there. And that's where my grapes came from exactly. Okay, Exactly. I like that. And it is site specific. Um, it's also honoring the growers that are doing all the hard work to grow it because we'll put their name on the bottle but you'll taste this wine, and it's going to be what came from that vineyard in one year. It might have a higher piracy in characteristic than the next, and one year it may have less. But it's going to be a model of that vintage from that vineyard and really again trying to make it speak for the varietal character. Always the main focus for me, Okay? And that makes sense. And that's why you can come in here and have that cab, Franck, and it's gonna be delicious, and it's going to stand on its own, right? I like it. And I did. Last time I was here, I walked out with, I think, at least two bottles. Maybe it was delicious. Good on. And I had a couple bottles, other stuff, too. And I think today I did not get the sera last time on, and that's what we're drinking to. Even though we're talking about the cab bronc we're drinking. This Siraj is because you guys were talking about it on, you know, when I first came in and I'm like, I have to taste that and now I will walk out with a couple bottles of those. Wonderful. Thank you. No, thank you. You make a delicious products. Okay. Is there anything else you kind of made me want to share about either cap drunker, winemaking life or anything else. I mean, you don't have to, but if you do anything to throw out there Well, as I mentioned, Cab Franck is my wife's favorite varietal. It has become a lot of people's favorite varietal. Our guests come in and love the cabernet. Franck. They love the blends that that are made with it. It's, ah, an extraordinary varietal toe work with its very distinguishable. So if you get a chance as the listener to go explore some of these cabernet franc's, do so and please be open minded about him and, um, go taste him. Come up to Sonoma County. We've got 30 tasting rooms right here around the around the Healdsburg Plaza. Um, and there's probably a handful of us maybe five or six of us that are making cap frog, which is kind of crazy and definitely come by thumbprint. I mean, the wines are amazing. The people are amazing. I love it. I'm going to say it, even if you can say it too. But while you're doing that, definitely come by thumbprint. Absolutely. And you welcome to start here too. We were very welcoming Were all trained as concierge. So we'll tell you where to go. Have lunch. What other wineries you want to explore? Um, no problem. We have a great referral system here, and we love to send you off to the next place that fits your needs. Yeah. Yeah. And that again, I mentioned to you I have several friends who are actually members of the winery here. And they said that they the winds were fabulous. And that's one of the reasons they joined. But another one, the main reasons they joined it was because of the staff and the people. And that's why they keep coming back. And they always have great experiences. So I'm also that out there. Thank you. If you can't get to Healdsburg, although you should, they can find you online at thumbprint sellers dot com. Yes, and we do. Ah, ship Thio. Most states we are a small producer and we make our own wines were able to ship Thio. Most states that were licensed in Excellent. Yeah, awesome. Well, you could find out about unsophisticated palate and give us some feedback thoughts, ideas for future topics at the unsophisticated palate dot com. Uh, as always we ask you to raid us, tell friends and neighbors spread the word about what we're doing here so everybody can enjoy and participate on until next time. Drink responsibly, tears, tears."

A podcast about all things wine, beer and spirits. Join us each week as we drink and delve into different alcohol related topics. I'm Mark and I'm Jen. Cheers. Cheers. Oh, welcome back, Jen. Thank you. Might have missed you here. I miss you too. And you, You got the intro there. You know what? I only had to practice twice. I did drink while practicing because I had to, you know, get my liquid courage back up. It's been a while since I've been in front of this microphone drinking fixes a lot of things. Such as It fixes most things and cause other problems. But that's a whole nother problem. Drinking something pretty delicious right now, actually, Yes. Well, first of all, this is a celebration. It is. It's a big celebration. Ah, huge landmark. It is something I am. So I am so proud of you. I'm so proud of this. What are you reading? What are we celebrating? ST. Mark's episode 50 to 1 Year of the Unsophisticated. That is amazing. I remember what it was. Just a thought, just a little baby. And then it has flourished into something so amazing and look at it now. And it's been a lot of fun. And Jin came back to join us. Wear so happy. I'm so happy. I want for you to this. I am just so happy to be here. It just feels right. It does. And so normally we drink what we're talking about, What we're not talking talking about. Yeah, that sounded. It sounded weird. But now that you say now that I'm thinking about it, that's right. Yeah, yeah, we're drinking a rose A We're drinking. Rosa, Wait. Way we've been treating already, but not that much. Yeah, right. If we're talking about her as they were drinking or is a yes, but today a we don't have Ah, well, we do have a specific topic, but it's not really specific drink. But more important, it's a celebration. So we said, let's drink what we like. Exactly. And we didn't tell each other specifically what we were gonna be drinking. It was Just pick your favorite. Yes. So what is in your glass there? Okay, So what I am drinking is something called a paper plane. Paper plate it is. I know it sounds weird. The name. It doesn't look anything Paper plane ish. It does not. It's not white. It's not flat. Exactly. Know. And it is. But it is multidimensional. Yeah. Okay. I like that. Big words. Um, I was introduced to this drink when I was in Paso, and it is one of the most phenomenal beverages because it includes some of my favorite alcohols. It has Amaro Nino. They sometimes you know what that is. Okay, so it's in. Do you want for metas? So it's in the, like, teach digestive family like it's just you just you just e family. Okay, so it has that. Okay, It has Aperol. Okay. Has birthday know very little about We gotta learn about that anyway. Bourbon, bourbon and lemon and lemon. Oh, equal parts of all of them. Okay. And usually it's shaken with ice. Or sometimes it's just over ice. But you can have it as long as it's chilled. It's delicious. It is Sichuan. Taste it. I actually, if you don't mind. So it's slightly sweet, but not overly sweet. It is. And it's a really pretty color. It's kind of like a dark red orange. It is so good. That is not what I expected it to taste like that is really good. Really delicious. Yeah, So sweet. But it's it's very smooth. I like that s o Some places. Like I said, use a different kind of tomorrow. But it don't. No matter which one you get, it is always delicious. So can I order paper playing most places. And they would actually kind of know what I'm talking about. Cocktails. Like, long as they have a pretty good bar, most places will know, or they'll look it up if they they'll be like, Yeah, yeah. And then you can go see them looking up a paper plane because I feel like the craft cocktails made a pretty big comeback lately. Big time. And so I feel like most places now would know how to make it. Okay, tell me what's in that glass over there. This glass. This is a godfather. That is You're hot. When I originally discovered it, it was called a padrino, which is the I think it's Italian for a godfather. Uh, which makes it sound like even more, you know, tough and madly. You Oh, my gosh. I have to say you really come a far along. Right? Okay. I don't know. For those of you who have been list, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but those of you who have been listening from the beginning remember when we started out and Mark was really into the fruit fees like that. I have not left the front behind. Don't get that room. But the fact that this is what you picked is your favorite. I just can't believe it. I just I just feel so proud. This is my cross to drinking this. Yes. Now you're not mentioning the umbrella. No, this is actually wearing a coconut thing. Coconut bride home. It's just not the kind of change, you know, ways. This one, actually. And it's got Well, it's got at least one pretty good angry. And that's Scotch. I like the Glenfiddich. That's the first time I had it. And it I just I tried it with a couple of scotches. Not quite the same. So a Glenfiddich. I go to 12 year because, honestly, the 15 year plus and up is this is gonna sound God, How far if I come, that's a little snooty, but it's too good a scotch to mix with anything. I totally get that Some some alcohols or just you wouldn't want it wouldn't be a mixing alcohol. Yeah, I don't want to dilute it. I want to enjoy it in its purity s. So this is the 12 year on. Then it's mixed with the disorder Justice our know, how would you? Is that how you said dis are? No, it's around him. Disarray, No Amaretto. So it's basically amaretto. But again, I've tried it with another Amaretto once, not the site. So that's the good stuff. Yes, it is the good stuff and it's really cool. So it's about two parts Scotch to one part, and I know that some of do half and half doubt it out it out. But it's 2 to 12 Scotch to one AM arado and most people drinking of rice I like it need I prefer it neat and And what I like is you get that really good scotch flavour, but it brings in its I convey. The amaretto is like an almond liquor, so brings in a nice little sweetness and just kind of smooth it out. That is so much milder than I expected. It to be? Yes. Oh, that is easy. That is an easy, velvety drinker. Whoa. So maybe I haven't gone too far, my friend. Nobody. No, no, it's not sweet. It is like, literally like I just drink a blanket. Yes, And that's what you're like when I first tasted. It's got that little I think it's a little sweet from the amaretto in the almond flavor, but it's not every sweet on you. Get the Scotch and just smooth. That was my reaction the first time I had that as a no brainer. Moly. I took that ship and I literally went online, ordered the scotch order the amaretto, picked it up on my way home. I my mother would love this drink. OK, godfather, I'm having. I'm making that for her. She's coming to visit soon. Yes. And you camp again. You You're having a godfather. Soon you can put it on nights that I have it and I I get with ice and rest. Now, this one's a lot tougher to order because I've gone places and tried to order it. And people get this glazed over. Look, when you say godfather Okay, good to know. And I don't trust them to go and look it up and make it right on. Make it with the ingredients that I like. So I tend to only order one place. It's somewhere in Michigan. It's a fabulous pizza place. That's why it's called the Petrino. They actually brought the oven over from Italy. Ah, Anyway, I'm gonna forget the name. We'll put it in the show notes and that. Will. You guys can look it up there anyway. And that's where I discovered it. And that's the only place I'll drink existing only place I've found that gets it right other than me myself, right? I bet you could say I want this drink. And if you don't know how to make it, let me tell you. Although that's kind of just kind of a jerky thing to do. No. No. And I've thought about that. Do you have this? You have the Glenfiddich 12 year. And do you have the this are? No, it's D I s a r r o and Thoreau. No, Actually, that would make sense. Disa Roanoke double. And so the disarray. No Amaretto. Okay, do 2/3. 1/3. Whatever. But I don't know I do kind of feel weird. And, you know, I used to be a partner. I'm trying to think Would I be mad? I don't know. I don't know what's up on. There's a lot Like you said, the craft cocktails have made a comeback, So there's a lot of good options out There is a lot of good wine like this is a good at home drink. Can't you mean by the fire? All cozied? Oh, man, that is a good one. I'm actually makes you want to go get Scotch and Amaretto. I never thought I'd have amaretto on my bar. Not I'm not gonna lie. I just didn't seem like something. But I don't know what else it all goes into. I know there are other fruit ease that you could add it to mark. So I mean, I'm sure that there's a whole range of things you could I don't know. I just I don't know. I think Toretto to we probably could have been explored past this because again, it's one of those, like, I don't want it for anything else. And I also got to admit there are you also bought the most enormous bottle of it. Well, that's because the one at home is almost out, and so I know that that one will be there. Yeah. This is also, though, and we will get to our topic eventually. Here. We promised. We're just gonna leave you in suspense. What are they going to talk about today? Are they only gonna talk about these two drinks for God knows how long, right? I don't know. You don't know? They're just wishing they could have them there. I know it was so delicious, but that said this is motivated me through a few workouts where I'm like, I know I'm going home. Like you have this in your water bottle. No, no, no, no, no. Like, I'm gonna go home and have one. So it's just like, Okay, I just got to make it to the last 10 50 minutes of this class or this work out of this, whatever. And I get to go home and have a godfather, and then it's like, you're okay. Maybe Maybe that's a little here. No, I think that's great. You know, sometimes that's what you need to get through that to get yourself to that workout you need your motivation, your motivator? Because I'm times mine is real Housewives in a glass of chardonnay. There you go. You got what you got to do what you gotta do. You can't have it unless you do the work out. Exactly. But once you do work out, you get it. Yep. Yeah, I hear you. So that's waiting. I see what you're putting out. So she told what we're actually talking about today? Well, when might we order these drinks? Well, you know, I would maybe order this when I go to drum roll, please. Happy hour. Who doesn't love Happy hour? I mean it. The name alone says that happy you're happy for? Release an hour. And you know, ironically, it's usually more than our Yes. So, yeah, today's topic is happy hour. And there's way more to this topic than I ever would have imagined. So, um, Mark, what is happy hour? Yeah, and I thought I was thinking like, Oh, that might be something we mentioned as part of something else, but yes, delving into some of this. It's got fun history. It's got a lot going on. So happy hour today is really it's a marketing term. You know, that's that's essentially what it is. And it really refers to discounts on food and drinks, right, usually in a bar or pub or something. But they're in all the rest of all the restaurants, many restaurants all over the place, really. And so it's just a term for discounts. It's usually between the hours of five and seven. It could be anywhere from 4 to 8. I find they said 5 to 7. I think my most common one that I experience is like the 4 to 6 kind of thing. Yeah, because the idea is they're cutting you off about dinner time because they want full price for that. Well, yeah, and they're trying to get, like, people in when it's their down time, Really? You know, that's when they're trying to get Yes, it's happier. Oh, yeah. Celebrate. But really, they're trying to make money when they're not making money. Anyway, the pre dinner crowd, right? Yeah. So it makes sense. Yeah, So come in and get a deal, right? But you know, Mark, that's not how it actually originated. No, it did not know it had nothing to do with alcohol. or food discounts, which is a little disappear s ing to suppressing its depressing. I know that makes us drink too strong. I you know what keep you keep drinking. I'll tell you a little bit about the history I'm gonna dis oppressed you depressed over there and drowned down, Drown your to sorrow. Oh, my stardom. I was really good. Unintentional, but really funny at the same time. Um so it actually comes from American naval slang from the 19 twenties that following the first World War, and it was this allocated period of time where sailors participated in all sorts of activities to relieve their the monotony sze of seafaring life and that could include wrestling. It could be boxing matches or other athletic activities. Um, and really, the whole point of it was to boost morale, make you happy. So this was their happy hour. This had nothing to do again with alcohol. But this is also during Prohibition. This term got picked up. And while people were supposed to be staying dry during Prohibition, in fact, they were not staying dry. They were getting a little tipsy in there in secret places, you know, maybe speakeasies or at home, and they would have these happy hours and during their pre dinner time before they went out. And that's how the term kind of picked up and caught on. And eventually in the seventies and eighties, the service industry kind of picked it up. And so, um, thesis kind of awesome. Let's take this and make it our own, Yeah, no, there's lots of fun in there and I found a couple other things. You know what? Fine going. The first kind of mention of Happy hour. Now, this was not again happy hour as we know it today, right? Was actually in Shakespeare's Henry the fifth. And at that point in time, happy hour was more of a pleasant time of the day. So it's like, this is the happy hour because it's a good time of day. So we're all just happy and chilling. I like it. Yeah, so that was like, that was kind of the first at least no mention that I could find it was used, actually, uh, in the sense of 18 eighties and as so many things in this world, so many good things in this world it goes back to women. I did not know where you were going to go with that. So I was like it. I like it. Keep going. Yeah. Yes. Apparently there were many social clubs, primarily women's social clubs who name themselves the Happy Hour Social Club or the Happy Social Club. That would be okay. I'm loving this. The Happy Hour Social club. Yeah. Although then again, it was more about the time of day. It was more about a pleasant hour. It was more about We're gonna get together and hang out and enjoy company and do that. It wasn't. Let's get together and drink. Yeah, I kind of feel like I want rename my group of friends The Happy Hour Social Club. I like it here. That girls, it's gonna happen, actually. Think it just happened. It just happened. That's right. I'm gonna call you. No, no, no, you're spot on. And as you said in the course, then the navy did their thing. But what I kind of found interesting. You were talking about Prohibition, right? That's when the like, the cocktail hour and are happy with the idea of drinking before dinner. Really kind of started because I can't go to a restaurant and get a drink, right? Yeah. So I will go to, like, said the speakeasy or something else. And it would be called a cocktail hour or a happy hour, and I'd go there, get my drink on That's right. Then go out to dinner. And that's kind of how that, like, pre dinner drink kind of whole thing started. And, of course, once prohibitions over. And I could drink during dinner, too. Why would I not have a pre dinner drink anyway? Exactly. Yeah. Drink it up, take it and run. Ooh, yeah, And one more fun fact. I love tax. Right. This is actually the first reference to an actual, like drinking in the afternoon in a bar. So the first happy now they're apparently maybe others. This is this is the unofficial official one. Okay. But actually was in the Saturday Evening Post in 1959 and they said that there was a lot of this goes back to the military. So the military people in this particular region were spending too much money during happy hour at the bar. Oh, and it was basically referencing This is a good paying gig, and you can save a lot of money unless you're one of the people who are spending all your money. Oh, my gosh, that is so funny on the Saturday evening Post, Right, man, that just makes me think Norman Rockwell thing. But then right there is happy hour and there's happy hour. Oh, my gosh, I love it. So there's a good history. There is a good history, and I just think it's so interesting that happy hour really originally had nothing to do with drinking at all. Yes, but then here it is on that kind of mean I not to romanticize this a little bit, but I'm going to, um, I think it's kind of like almost that concept. Better of, like I said, that pleasant time of day, that our of happy ace, our social club, right? We're just hanging with or just something good, right? You're sitting. I mean, that would fit like you're sitting there, barbecues going. You're hanging out the sun set and you get it, maybe the drink in hand so it may be slightly drink associate ID, but it's still it's It's more about that than it's just the idea of enjoying time. Yeah. Now, I'm not saying I would like to save some money, though, right? I mean, who doesn't like to save some money you have in times who doesn't love a deal. Right? And I have intentionally gone to places early enough to get happy hour specials. I'm not going. Yeah, I know. Me too. There are definitely some rules and stuff that go along with Happy Hour as well. It sounds great. And you think everybody should do it, don't you? Well, obviously, everyone should do Happy hour. Why would people not do happy? Yes, they can't. Jen, what are you talking about? Well, there's some places where it is illegal or at least legally limited to enjoy your happy hour. Well, that just sounds absurd, right? Why would they do such a thing? Well, this is what I really like, and this kind of explains it to a degree, But Ontario, Canada, actually in the law. This is how it reads. Oh, I can't read my own writing. Okay. Started. Okay. Oh, okay. I'm on the edge of my seat. Hold. All right, everybody ready? Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready. Can't promote it. Quote in a manner that may promote immoderate consumption unquote. So, basically, if I'm telling you, a two for $15 wouldn't usually 10. Whatever. I'm encouraging immoderate consumption have more because it's cheap, right? Kind of makes sense. Yeah, but I don't know. You goto Ireland where it's completely illegal. Oh, yeah. And Ireland, of all places. You think they'd want some deals on there? They got great beer. They got great whiskey. I want to get it. Yeah, I got a deal, but no. Right, full price. Still go. It still doesn't mean that's true. In the UK, you have to take quote all reasonable steps unquote to prevent irresponsible drinking. Okay, well, I mean, you should drink responsibly. I mean, that's a little Lucy gives the all reasonable steps. E doesn't mean that I did my best. I know. Like I tried. I try exactly. Um and then in the U. S. In Massachusetts, it's illegal in Utah. They banned it in 2012 2012. Which kind of surprises me because that's recent enough in history. I would think it would have been banned a long time ago. Yes, right. That seems pretty. Yeah, I was surprised that it was apparently illegal. Till then in North Carolina, you conduce your discounts on food on Lee. Oh, not on drinks. So you can have a happy hour, but not on alcohol. And this, I think, was the most fun thing I found. Oddly, we talked about how it started in the Navy, in the military and spread everywhere. It is currently abolished at all military base clubs. They cannot have happy. Oh, my gosh. So the people that started it decided no. Wow. Wow. Yeah, no, you know, just it kind of makes sense. I in my head. In my experience, it's always been about a deal, right? I'm going to get a special I'm gonna get an inexpensive drink or I'm going to get, you know, in expensive appetizers or something like that. And it's about Hey, let's go and get some cheap stuff. I've never thought of it as Hey, there are only $3 or $2 or $1. Whatever. Let's have 10 of them. But apparently people do. Yes, some people would see that as an opportunity to just get slashed. And so then thus people make laws around. I mean, we would never do such a thing because we're very responsible. Why would I haven't e I know now that now that I'm reading all this and why haven't I taken this opportunity? Right? Well, for me, it's kind of tough to get slashed it, I don't know. Four in the afternoon or whatever. It's gonna be for 30 maybe. Yeah. I mean, that's early in the day to get slashed. Well. And also, let's keep in mind that happy hours, usually Monday through Friday. That is also true. So it's not like it's a Saturday or Sunday. You know, most of us are happy hour ing on the during the work week. So, you know, we have toe, you know? Yeah. Yeah, the next day. And it makes a little rough. Yeah. And you know, even then again, if you if you take advantage of it, you're slashed by six ish, right? That's a long it's rough. Especially when you're my agent. You're just It's just when you're young like us. Yeah, young like us. I know it's rough. Okay, is rough, but you learn other happy hour funds. Eso You know, happy hour is not just in restaurants. There are companies that are offering happy hours at work. Wait a minute. I know I'm in the wrong. I'm definitely working in the wrong place. I will say my establishment does not offer happy hour. In fact, it is heavily discouraged. Thio. However these I'm there. A lot of companies, especially start ups, were in our area where I live that offer happy hours to build, boost morale with it amongst the staff they want well, part of it is, I think they want people to kind of state work, but that's just my own assumptions. But you know, they have to get to know your coworker is engaged with them in the network, right? And they also offer. He's not everybody drinks, but they offer nonalcoholic happy our options for their other staff members. That makes me happy, because for people like me, when I didn't drink, they would have a happy hour or something and you couldn't go and you couldn't participate because you felt weird. So I like that. I'm sorry. I just got to make that known for people as a drinker. Now I still think it's important to stand up for people who make the choice not to drink for whatever reason and make sure they're included. And this comes brings an interesting point. Okay, because it brings up the term happy hour because these people are not paying, their company is providing happy hour, right? Really? There's no deal. It's happy free hour. That's one better deal. Deal. So it kind of is so kind of rings at the point of, like, the changing terminology of happy hour, right, Which I think I don't know if you want to bet Now, if you want to talk about it later. But, like so you know, the idea of happy hours kind of evolved where before, at least for me, like it used to be. Okay, where the best deals? Here we go here. And we could get the $3 glass of wine quality. Yeah, I'm not gonna lie like I used to go to this place was like, Oh, I get three or $4 last divine. They would have deals on appetizers from this time to this time. But now, at least for me, it's Oh, let's go. I'll go meet for happy hour. But it's that is Oh, let's just go meet for drinks after work. Yeah, it's not necessarily Let's go meet for at a place that has Happy hour specials. Yeah, it's it's 1/2. Gets back to the original back to the original meaning. Let's just meet and have fun after work. Let's have a happy hour. Let's go get together. So we kind of gone back to the original. Let's just get together and enjoy ourselves and literally a places that have no deals at all or times when happy hours actually over. But And not to say that sometimes, you know, sometimes you do go to places where Happy hour exists, but sometimes it doesn't. And so at this workplace they're literally creating a happy hour where it's just that time it's free. It's great, it's enjoyable. But it's not. And it's provided by their company, which is so amazing. Yes, I like it, you know, And the thing, too, from what I know. I mean, they're providing a drink or whatever. You know, people aren't getting slashed again. It's a chance to kind of relax a little bit, see how things go and kind of go from there, right? Totally. It's so amazing, but also happy hour is different in different places in the world. It is. So this summer I was in Italy and they dio happy hour to the extreme. So they set up when it is happier. They call it a pair of TiVo. Like they call it, It's I'll say it's called like in a pair of TiVo hour, but they feel like Okay, like a pair of TV was. Whatever I like, I like that because it works. That's what you're drinking is right. It's a para TiVo's. They set up full buffets. No joke. The food is free. Nice, and some places are better than others. All you have to do is buy a drink, and it is a full buffet. At some of these places, I would say to a drink for that right Sometimes built when you order your drink, they just bring you little snacks to your table, and that's during the specific time. Sometimes, you know, like we would just like, kind of stumble upon it, but it's during the pair of TiVo. I don't know in other places in Europe if it's like this exactly, but it was pretty amazing, and I know in Asia like throughout Asia. They definitely had Happy Hour similar to the United States. Where would be like two for one specials and similar to what we would see here. So it is kind of universal in some places around the world, so you will be happy. But I know it's not everywhere. And we tried to get a little more international information on it. It's hard to find. My gosh, I did try to do so much research. I was trying. I was like, Where is it? So based on my own experience, people out there reach out to us. Let us know What is your happy hour experiences? See, when you're not in the United States, because I want to know where to go when I'm traveling? Exactly. Yeah. Now that said I did find on Redfin, they published some pretty cool fund map stuff. Yeah, tell me. So you could go check these all that if you want to, But it was named the top countries. United States States on United States cities, et cetera, et cetera. So I'm gonna share some of this. Okay, let us number one country, and this is okay. I should I don't know, Define this. It's based upon what people are posting about. Happy hours of searching the social media's and where people posting the most about happy hour, you know? So number one United States love it. Okay, We're I'm not totally surprised. Yeah. Number two. You were mentioning this Hong Kong. Okay, Number three Singapore. Okay. I did find a bunch about Singapore. So when I was trying to do my research, Singapore came up. Yeah. Yep. Apparently they like their happy hour. Almost as much as we in Hong Kong. Okay, Okay. Italy was number four is so funny. There you go. And number five Australia. Ah, gotta love the Aussies. Knew it. Cheers to them for years. All right. Cheers to the Aussies and we drink. Yes, I know. We had eye contact there, though. Joe Me on. You know what? I'm really disappointed. That was one you insisted upon? No, when I broke it. God, there goes all my luck. There you look. Yeah, that's what it is. Luck. I think it's seven years of bad. Something else there, Jen, I was trying to be p e. You know p for B p g. It's just something else. If you want more info, we have an episode on tears. Oh, my gosh. If you guys have not heard the cheers episode, it's a classic. It's gonna go down in unsophisticated palate history as one of our best. I kind of think it's if it's not my favorite, it's definitely top three. I mean, I love that one. Okay. Rare form, yes. Very rare form. We're having fun that they So, anyway, so now, since the United States was number one. Yeah, the top states in the United States. Okay, I wanna guess. Okay. Okay. Top states for happy hour in the United States. And you based on social Media posting New York number two. That's number two. Number one. Texas. No, didn't even break the top. Okay, Number one is going to be California Did not even make the top five or even top 10. Actually, California. I was surprised. Number one, Nashville, Tennessee. Tennessee. No, that's on the top 50 my God. Okay. Number one is going to be Florida. That was number four. Okay, Baxter, the wind up with one. Yeah, he is. Baxter, you need to stop drinking so much. Number one. Okay, I'm gonna try. You're not gonna guess I'll give you one more guests. Okay. Is gonna be Kentucky. No, that did not even make the top five. And just tell me just just stop beating around the bush. Mark D C. Washington, D. C. Interesting. It kind of makes t o and or maybe it's networking or something. But anyway, number to New York. Number three is Montana. Number four is Florida, and number five is Oregon. So go Oregon. I mean, do you have a clock on the telly? Oh, I'm rusty. It's been a while. I just I have a dog that's coughing, and I My TV just turned down, okay? And we may leave that in. I don't know. What way. Don't care. You know what? It's you know? Jen's back. It's Jen's back. Whoo! Cheers to that. Cheers to that. And we are. We're definitely leaving that in there. Yeah, because it's hilarious. You know, it was a good movie. It was way watching their job was watching crazy, rich East patients. Okay, Crazy rich asians. Jen recommends it. Oh, it's holding its awesome. Okay, so it's become a movie recommendation podcast. Yeah, why not? Okay, I like it. We just roll. We just roll. Right? That's, uh so let's go to top cities. Do you want to guess the top cities cities for a happy hour? Are any of the same cities on the list? Well, those were all states, states. I was. So I will tell you that the surprisingly the top city is not in one of the top five states. I am going to say Los Angeles. Los Angeles area is all top five is like Hollywood has one Glendale, West Hollywood, I think. I mean, the entire L A area. All the cities that make that up make up the top five. Unbelievable. I am going to just high five myself right now for being amazing. Little just high five herself. I want a high five minute l cal high five, you know, here we go. OK, I just thought this was also find it interesting what they were posting about Jen. Yeah. The top five things they posted about was drinks or the drink that they were drinking cocktails, beer, the bar or bars or something. Referencing bars, food. OK, number six hot people. Jeez, that's smart. Brilliant, but no friends like they left friends for like, number six, though it is nice, though. I mean, but happy hour with friends. Happy birthday, Jen. Whatever. You know, But no, I'd rather talk about and post a picture of my drink. And let's be honest, that's more what you see. It is true. Well, probably because these drinks look super cool. Some of them, I think they tagged their friends in the in the stuff, though they're like, Oh, yeah? Then it would kind of count his friends, But you don't name them, so then it wouldn't show up. Right? So it's like you wouldn't have a picture of your friend. Yeah. Okay. I like it. All right. So that those air those are my Redfin fun. Happy hour place fax. Have you Do you have any favorite happy hour locations? I don't I must confess, I just enjoy a good, happy hour. I tend to I probably should seek them out more. I just tend to go eat where I like. And if I am thinking about it, I'll try to go a little early and hit Happy hour. I think Maur the people hang out with you and others will be like, Who is happy hour? Let's go there. And I'm always like, Yeah, so I don't have a favorite place. How about you, Jen? I'm the same. You know, I used to back in the day I have my favorite places, but now it's more about the people. I'm the exact same. So no favorite happy hour places? No, Not anymore. I feel Yeah, I just like to hang with my friends. Okay, Happy hour whenever possible. And I tried to look up some, like, really weird or fun or an expensive kind of stuff to get some fun. Fact, he kind of stuff, but I couldn't find things. So again, let us know. I mean, I found like, some great deals. There's like suppose is super high quality. What? It's some kind of a cocktail martini, I think was a martini or something. And it was like, 99 cents, and it's normally, like, $15 or something. So, I mean, there's some good deals out there, but nothing like super fun ish. Yeah. So if I was gonna leave anyone with any word of wisdom from this podcast, if it were me is, it may not be seeking out the best happy hour, but definitely seek out a happy hour to spend with people. That's really like Jen's engine. I like it, you know, because I think it's important. You know, it doesn't necessarily mean it. By all means. If you want to go find the best happy hours and you'll find the best deals, go for it. That's important to save. Save a little money. Um, but I definitely think the most important part of Happy Hour is the people you spend it with. Agreed? Agreed. Can I share too fun? Fax? Yeah. Okay, so one is if you are looking for those deals. Yeah. You want to save the money? Apparently, Tuesday is the best deal. Really? That's what Apparently that's when the big deals on stuff is. I don't know who figured that out, but that's when the biggest discounts are Tuesday. Okay. And then I did find for those who cannot make happy hour, apparently reverse Happy hour is the thing I forgot I was gonna mention that too. I totally forgot that. Okay, go. No, no, you go. What do you know about it? I did never heard of this before. the one that's it. Late at night. Yes. Yeah, I totally forgot. I had a note about it. Like after nine. Yeah, it's the late night happy hour. Yeah, yep, which I had never heard of. But apparently a thing, and it's it is getting big. You know, it's it's been around for a while. Actual hasn't. Yeah, but it wasn't widespread before, but it definitely has been around for a little while. And it's, you know, same kind of deal. It's, you know, they usually do different. Well, at least the ones I've seen they do different eats different bar bites at night or whatever it might be. But similar drink specials, that kind of thing. And usually I've seen it from, like 9 to 11 or whatever it might be. But for the late night again, when they may not be selling as much food or may not be selling as many drinks or whatever it might be what's gonna happening? Yeah, part of me says that's a little late to kind of start on the drinking. But then I also gotta think back when I was young, I mean, party didn't start until after 10 right and maybe even till even after again. These are also usually at restaurants. Yeah, well, restaurants would be different. I think it had a bar. The party doesn't start till then in a restaurant. They're going to close its closing stuff. Yeah, we'll get some of the merit bars. So if you're in a bar, But and that might get people to come in a little bit earlier. Because I What I would do is a lot times my friends and I, we wouldn't even go until 11 ish, right? Because that's when the party starts or whatever. And so that might go to send early instead of doing what we would do, which is pre game, Right? Right. And then there's a happy hour. Maybe I'd go there and drink, right? That's true. God, can you imagine? Starting going. I can't imagine going out that late. Yeah, sorry. I just told myself Oh, my God. I'm liking my jam jams on my couch. Oh, it 11 e 09 p.m. Okay. No jam jam her, sir. Quite possibly already in bed. So why is it embarrassing? I mean, doesn't it? Well, if you're young, you'll appreciate it. It's just if you're older, you've never jam jams. Oh, God. All right. I think I think we've hit it. I think you guys get the point. Copy hours. Great. Happy hour is good. Yeah. Go enjoy them. Yeah. Go do them Drink it up. And and with friends with friends And again as Jen was pointing out Make it happy hour whenever and wherever you are I make it whatever it is to you. Yes. So until next time, I think Well, actually, no. They wantto message. See, we've been I'm with Jen. We're drinking. We're distracted.

A podcast about all things wine, beer and spirits. Join us each week as we drink and delve into different alcohol related topics. I'm Mark. I'm Michael. Cheers. Cheers. Oh, that is good. That is tthe e. You're a merlot. Yeah. 2016 were low. Get low on that one, though. Uh, but I'd better picks him up. Takes actually already told you I'm taking some home. Hey, um, so welcome back, Mike. Mike from Oak Tree Winery. Just how you doing? How's Oak Tree Winery? What's new? Very good. Thanks, Mark, for having me again. Always a pleasure. Um, we're doing good. We making some good progress here. We've got into a wine bar from the last time we talked, I think. And Ah, 2017 bottle and knee deep in harvest right now. So harvest time. That's hard time with doubling production this year and adding a sauvignon blanc. Really? Yeah, that's nice. So making some big headway here? Yeah, And if you're doubling production, that means things are going well. I like that. We're making sales one day at a time. There you go. That's how you do it. That's how you do it. And again, I'm walking away with a a few bottles today, so I'm doing my best to help the cause. It's right, right with the economy. Yeah, somebody's gotta be. Oh, um, awesome. So this week, we're talking about wine apse. So there's a ba jillion different. Ah, of them out there. I think we've narrowed it down to some of the top ones. Or from what I was in kind of more recommended more well known on da lot of these, I think we were both talking about before we haven't personally used. All of these are medically. Yeah, I a lot of them caught my interest. And I'm like, I need to know more about this one. And there's a couple. I'm actually really glad we did this episode because I had a need for something like this, Diego. And then guess what? There is an app for that. Yeah, I thought they were just kind of one type of AP, and there was all just kind of scores and reviews, and that was it. But no, there's a lot more than that. Yeah, I'll agree to I kind of figured it was a very small market out there, but it is large. And so we broke it down into kind of categories. Ish? Yeah, I would say so. Yeah. And so? Well, these are our own created ones. Uh, don't judge. And and we'll just kind of go. So I think the 1st 1 we came up with is kind of labels, label recognition labeling, basically all things to do with wine labels. Yeah, that was a fun one. I think they have some good APS around that one. The cool part is you don't have type it in anymore. You can just use your camera on your phone and recognizes the label for you and shows you what You wanna know about it? Yeah. I mean, cause you're gonna have a a bottle of wine a lot of times. And we've actually talked about this sometimes. Take a picture to remember it. Whatever the zaps, you take a picture. It will. If you don't know about the wine, we'll tell you all about the wine, right? Uh, the ratings, the scores, Like you said, tasting notes, all that other fun stuff. And then then they'll kind of store them for you. So that you can go back to ones that you like a great way to take advantage of that in the store. You know, I spent hours in the store looking at wines. You can take the bottles, take a couple of screens pictures, and you get your information at your fingertips. So don't tell anybody too much about that, because we have the how to choose a wine episode. And no one people that realized that they could just use a nap. And and, uh oops, I just peed a spoiler, right? Actually, just came because that is a great way. And I don't know, we definitely didn't talk about these then. So let's let's kind of event. So what is? What's a good labeling? One that you think that you you found her? You want to throw out there? Let's start there. Yeah, I think the most part of that I am very much aware of is Vivien. Oh, um, and they've been very Carmen one out there, probably downloads on the APP sites. It's a great recognition system, pulls up information very quickly. Anything you need to know about the reviews, the taste, the region's, the information it cost of store, um, information. There you see the pricing where to buy it. I think all that information is really useful for any person trying to pick out, ah, information about certain wine. Yeah, on where to buy it, I think is kind of huge, and a lot of these will have that. And we'll mention that because I've had that happen numerous times. I've had something in a restaurant or at a friend's house or something, and then you're trying to find it later, trying to find where to buy it. You're searching and you're Googling and you may or may not find it, and you don't know all that. So having to be able to just shoot the label there than them saying, Here's where you can buy it yeah, I love that shortcut. The thing I liked about them Vivino that I saw is ah, lot of these. You scan the label right? But there's a lot of wine out there, and not every label is in every app, so they have the option. It takes a while, but they will manually review the label, get some information on it and add it in which I think is pretty cool because you have to be patient, but you will get some information on that wine down the line. Yeah, that's that's a great little feature to add to that. You know, it just kind of left wondering what's going on and probably add to their database as well. So they probably appreciate finding new ones. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's it's a win win for everyone, right? For in them, they now have a label that many other people may not have. And for you, you've got information. So I like that they also sink with your Facebook Twitter accounts to make it pretty easy. Um, so, yeah, they really make it really easy for you to use. Okay, Another one that I did that did discover let me say that five times fast is delectable, like I kind of like that one. Just cause of the name delectable it. It sounds so Fonsi, but that's another one. You scan the label, it will give you the scores. Tasting notes Keep the wine journal of your favorites, et cetera. They're so they're they're similar, I think with them, though it's an additional. I know if it's an app or add on or whatever. It may be called banquet that you would go to actually make your purchases. So, uh, you know, get the wine label information. But actually, I want to buy something. You got to go somewhere else. So I've heard good things about it. But I also got admit, I don't like I like the vino in some ways just because everything in there, it's all in one place. Yeah, I have a feeling at some point time and get those together to make it easier. Yeah, And it makes sense because, like, we're about there was kind of one. We thought for labeling and then maybe for buying, and that's what they did. But I think again, as the markets grown and you know that those two will definitely kind of find a home together. I would agree with that. All right, what else you got in labeling? Um, have a couple other ones. Have hello, vino again. Very similar to the ones above. I think a lot of great reviews, though. Ah, your personal journals. Your everyday shopper wants to look at reviews, information, varieties. Um, I guess, um, there's a lot more to it as well. They are based out of California. So we do have live information. Always been pumped in as well. So the local just nice. Ah, and then they also have, I think, two different versions. A free in a page version as well. Yeah. And the paid version when I saw in there. And this was, I think because I tried to find what's unique about each one the zaps. Right? Because if they all do the same thing, that's good, I guess. You know, you can have lots of options, but I like to see what's important. So what I found on this one, like like Savino had the manual review, right? Hello, Vino. Ah, they have food pairing recommendations in there. And that, I think, is kind of unique that I did not see in the others. And then the other thing is, is with the premium version, you can consult an expert, so yeah, you can reach out and say, ask questions, get parrying recommendations, or again, just ah, Maur information on a wine. So, uh, you know, if that's something you're looking for you. We've often mentioned find a friend, you know, with Yeah. Get hello, Vino premium. And you've just bought yourself a friend. Well, they drink with you. I probably would. I doubt they'd say no. So let's see the other 10 another one I liked is Winesearcher. Ah, And that one had again the label scan. Ah, all that other kind of fun stuff. That couple of that. The key difference is that I found in this one is this one. Seemed to be a little bit more pricing. Had a lot more information on the current price of the wine. Not that the others don't. You can't buy it. But again, it seemed a little more pricing specific. And they also brought in spirits. So they have, like for scotch and bourbon and some other things, too. So if you're you know, it's nice to have that flexibility depend upon what you're eating or drinking today. To be able to say, Hey, maybe it's not a white knight. It so whatever night and I can go to the same app And now get some information on that. Yeah, I think with that one Thio, the 1st 50 searchers are free, but I think it's a pay after that Possibly. I also noticed they have a GPS based door finder so they can use GPS to find a store near you and that again. That's awesome, right? I just And for me, there's Well, I guess there's a lot in life force, and but it is not good. Let's just put that way again to find a wine that you really like, and then not be able to have access to it. There you go. Where can you find it? You don't know? Doesn't matter anymore at that point in time. Yeah. And I've got another one here. Do you have? Ah, another one to throw out real quick? A couple of them. Okay. Gambler wine ring and wine picker again. Very similar. Um, have lots of great reviews, um, again, personal tasting notes. A lot of these have. That's really important. I think that one of them here is wine ring. And you can actually include friends on share information as well. Yeah, I like that. Yeah, like, you know, we've talked about a lot of those other ones are all about me, right? But that one can make it about you and me so I could go on and say, Hey, what's Mike drink? And oh, hey, that looks good. I want to try some of that, especially if I know which I do know that you have good taste in why I may want to get a little bit more information, what you're doing or there's different different groups that go in and you can kind of get some information on them. So that is true. That is a good little connection. And then you said, Wine picker, Yes. Um, so again, I think this one had a little of everything we dish mentioned before. This also has food pairing. You could actually get food by your budget. I look different restaurants that have certain of these of these wines as well. So grass Ron's reverse search find picking wines for the menu. This one's a little bit different, but more restaurant focus, I would say. Yeah, exactly. That's kind of what I got out of that one. So I'm sitting in the restaurant. They've got this massive wine list. If you kind of know what you're gonna order and you know where you are, it will tell you here's some good wines to drink with that right now. Here's what I wanted to mention, and I We both found this one, and it's it's fun living wine labels. So if you guys haven't heard of this, they have a r, um, or augmented reality labels. So certain wineries, if you go to scan the label, it will make that label come to life on your phone. So it may tell a story. It may do a little, I don't know, scene or whatever it's gonna do that. And then in addition, it's gonna tell you all about the winery and any other kind of stories and things like that. But I just like that. It kind of makes that label supposedly come to life. Now, I've heard of this. I've yet to see it. I I really want to download it and check that out because it looks, if nothing else, fun. Yeah, I do believe those tied to a single winery, though. Oh, is it? Yeah. Oh, that takes all the fun out. Well, I guess not all the fun. Just some of the fun house that. Yeah. I mean, they're promoting their own wine label. 19 crimes. Um, from the treasury wine estates, so it's basically their own app. They also have winds around the walking dead that can d'oh fund reality show zombie type scenes as well. So it's kind of they're promoting their own. Wine's nice and it's a great way to do it, and it would make it fun. And hopefully they'll get some others to kind of come in and do that because it would every label, you know, maybe not necessarily. But it still would be a lot of fun to kind of go through and see certain ones and go like, Oh, hey, that's cool on. Don't just again have some fun. And while you're at the wine store has got nothing else to do it, um, let's see anything else label related, or should we move into the next one? Yeah. Okay. Next one. I kind of have Here is education, So Ah, these air all about, like ways you can educate yourself on wine, which is again, I guess we don't wanna Maybe we should just skip this category because then I'm gonna stop listening to the podcast here, right? Do you believe it? I know. I I think they're awesome. The reason we started. This is tow learn. Um, and if you can learn, I'm actually looking at a couple of these, and I may be spending some time on them so I can continue to learn, because it's a journey for us all. The big one I liked and or I think at least top the list for me was no. Your wine put out by decanter. And that one, It's like now the 1st 10 are free after that, you gotta pay. See, that's where we got on. The podcast is free. There you go. Yeah, I did buy them. There you go. Reach out. We're listening. Um, and we do take sponsors. Eso. Anyway. So on that one Weed teachers like the fundamentals at all levels. So it's not just like you know. So regardless of where you are on your journey, if you're on your first few steps or your well down the road, there's to be learned. You can kind of start where you want, and it's done in these short burst modules, which I think is good. Could you sit down and in just a few minutes, learn a lot, take some time absorbed that go with it and then turn around and check out the next one kind of a thing. Yeah, I like that a lot. And ah. Then if you're a brave soul, check out this next app, which is the S w e wine and Spirit trivia quiz. Who? So what? You think you know what you're talking about? You can download this app and about 5500 questions created by society of wine educators actually playing it earlier today, Uh, it made me feel really dumb. How did you do to you if you felt dumb? I'm not gonna pretend a lot of European area question, which is great, because then I realized, Wow, I didn't learn your old world. Exactly. You learn while you take the quiz, And if you don't score so well, you retake it and you know the answers and helps you to learn that. Excellent. And actually, that is That's kind of like, almost like I'm gonna consider it a flash card kind of a thing rather than a test, because I'm going to and I'm learning the flash cards right. And then and then once I know them, then I'll go take the test. I like that. I like that. Let's see, another one I had was Plunk, P, L O and K info. That's just info on wine. And it's kind of similar to the label one, I think. But where it's different, more education is it gives you information, not on just the wine. You're looking at it on the particular varietals or grapes that are in it. What, though some characteristics about those grapes and that that kind of wine and really kind of takes you down the road of whatever it is you're drinking not against winery specific, but more grape and or type specific. What I liked about this one as well is they have audio bytes to help with the pronunciation. So you can learn how to say someone's complicated wine varietals. Now you're taking all my excuses away. Hey, I can't say I can't pronounce it anymore, because I wanted to say, Hey, you forgot there's an app for that. Well, if I'm doing my research properly Nice. Nice. What else you got? But all I found for education. Well, I did. I had a couple others. I did have a tipple. Oh, yeah, And that woman was more centered on wine tasting, but it's it's kind of howto learn about wine tasting howto wine taste again. We've got an episode for that. Just go back and listen to that. Or you can check out the APP again. I'm not gonna. Wherever you get your knowledge is wherever you get your knowledge and we're 100% behind just learning and taking that journey here and then also ah one. And I've I've used them for a lot of stuff. They've got great infographics. They're called but wine enthusiasts. So they have a Napa's. Well, again, it has a lot of info information reviews because the wine enthusiast magazine and they have the ratings and they do their own stars. They do a lot of that. But they also, I've noticed, are big on education. And because of that, in their app, apparently there's there's some good education pieces, so you can kind of help teach yourself. Yeah, when I didn't find it all, which has great education is fully Um yeah, I didn't see anything on them. They would be a great app to have. Yeah, Alright, Foley, if you're out there, we like a lot of what you do online. You need to turn that into a nap. Maybe great, Okay, noted. And I'm sure everybody there is listening and they're getting right on that. Actually, they may be and or they may be already on top of it. Let's hope so, because I agree. I really like a lot of what they do. They do do a great job, but simplifying things. So this is on APS here. But let's say your app is Google on the Internet. That's a great place to go. Let's move on, then let's let's talk about ordering wine, ordering APS these again. I've talked about that. I may have mentioned that a couple times on this app already. I like to order my wallet. Agree? Idea? Yeah. You just did a home and get drunk and order wine? Yes. Okay, You don't have to go. You have to sober up enough to drive out and get more world coming too, right? But actually, I kind of find that that's really nice just because again, it's like I and a lot of times Aiken, you know you'll pick up or whatever, but again, if I'm looking for a particular type of wine. Um, it can get confusing to go in search and search. So the more APS that they can put it all in one place for me, the better. Or again, if you want to look local, there is drizzly on that one actually delivers within 24 to 48 hours. So maybe not quite enough time. They have too drunk to make the wine run. You may have to wait, but still it kind of get it to you quickly on Dad's gonna get it from somewhere either local or close enough that they're going to get it to you fast. They also have ah OK, Google of which commands. So when you can't get to your phone, you can lay on the couch and order a wine from the couch without your phone in your hand. Life is getting way too easy. I think I was just talking to somebody about this the other day. You've seen Wally, Of course. Oh, yeah. And you know, I thought that was a little exaggerated. But the thinking in this modern technology, the more I'm starting to think we mail just kind of float around on chairs and drink It's the start drinking wine that's coming to his direct wine. Why? Oh, that is a thing. I've seen that true. Yep. Okay, well, that made that may need to be an episode of every girl I know. What I found was, I think most common one. I've really noticed wine dot com. Yes. Um, they claim to be the number one online wine store. Massive selection. You can browse in check by budget. You can also scan labels as well. There's ratings on there from different professionals and credits. Um, there is a fee if you Well, there's not a fee if you want to do it one per time, but if you want to do like a subscription for $49 you could get free shipping on every order. I may or may not have already have that on my phone and may or may not have spent that $49 it may or may not have already paid for. It's like how you roll. I'm just I just say it and then this one. We plugged them a few times before, and they do not sponsor us, although they probably should. Total wine. Um, love the place again. They're beyond wine in everything they have. If you don't have a total, why near you You need to go. You walk in there. It's like a wine mecca overwhelming. Oh, in a good way. In a good way. Yeah. I mean, you walk in and it's just mind boggling how much wine there is, and everybody in the store is awesome. But if you can't get to the store, there's an app for that. You know, the radius is for delivery. I do not know. And that may very they do do some shipping. Um, And for me, I happen to have one close enough that it's, you know, I won't say maybe 15 minutes or so away from where I live. So what I like to do is go in there and just spend all day, which you can usually do. But what I also realizes sometimes I can't. Just if I walk in there, I'm gonna spend some course, so I will order ahead. I will go in. I will grab it right there at the front desk and I will exit. Ah, Otherwise I am shopping and buying way too much so you avoid the Costco effect? Yes, exactly. At the Costco effect, you know, 100%. I'm going in to pick up this one thing. I'm going to be in and out, and two hours later, you're out with a huge car and a whole lot more money than you expected. They don't drag you into the back for the one cent wine tastings. Oh, I, uh, at Costco are no at that little line. I have yet Thio. And they have to do that legally. They do, at least in California. Give it away. Yeah, In California, I think that's true. They can't give wine away, so you have to pay a penny. I have yet to be dragged into one of those. But one of the things I like where I minor handed here, but I don't care. We'll talk about it cause I think it's super cool. Going a little bit back to education is they have the wine tastings and they have experts that will walk you through it. But they also have several wine classes and seminars and education things. So again, if you're near one look it up, look up. When their classes are on what they are, and they're they're cheap, too free, and you just show up and they will educate you. And lastly, in a queue, plugged them, apparently. But one thing I like about them if they go direct to the winery without the middleman. So that's why they can lower the cost and make it more reasonable for everybody. Yeah, and that that's another thing to mention on there and again. I don't know why we keep plugging him. I'm gonna send them a bill. But again, No, it's just a Knauss, um, place and we will plug anything that's awesome, including Oak Tree Winery. Nice. It's amazing selection, but it's very reasonably priced very reasonably and and not just on the wine, but on on everything. I get my Scotch there because my favorite Scotch is there, and it is the least expensive there, and I'm not gonna say cheap because it's not cheap, the least expensive. They're out of anyplace on dhe. That's kind of crazy. When you think about it and they have cigars, why would you ever want to leave there? You know, that's a great thought. You know, I'm a found myself a new career. If I If I stop doing this, guys, you'll find me at the local total line and so great, Here we go. So let's move on to the next one, which is, Ah, recommendations kind of ties in there because a lot of those will make recommendations and ratings. But these ones, I kind of separated out because while you may be able to kind of scan the label or whatever, they actually are very specific to recommendations or pairings or or rating the wine much less so than they are about kind of identifying the wine on the label, if you will. So ah and I had a couple that had some overlap. So I think wine ring and wine picker fit in this a little bit as well. On the other one is pocket wine pairing, So if you just need a quick wine pairing fast recommendations, it's right there. It also says Do's and don'ts for wine pairings. Interesting. My personal opinion on that, and I'm sure this many a times pay attention to their dues. Always ignore the don'ts. Well, maybe not always, but that's where he gets into the drink. What you like territory you know, they're going to say, Don't drink a strong red wine with a white fish. Probably. And I've done it more than once. And if it's the wine I like and it's official, I like I'm doing it exactly. Yeah. So that was pocket wine pairing. Let's see. Well, do you have any others that are kind of, I guess, some of them or the critic ones? Vino West was one of them, which is a couple of the wine critics. Um, have about 200,000 tasting notes, a lot of articles, different information around, um, there wind to think the critics there. I'm not even try to say their name to. Probably gonna butcher them. Um, but no, they have a great step again. One of those ones were Subscription is also involved as well. Yeah. Now, is that one or was it the vino I know is one of these two where people can go in and raid it themselves, or maybe both. So, like, I could go in one. Is it the same one? Yeah, it is. Venus. Yeah. Okay. So I think that that's the one that again, the nice thing about that is you get the professional ratings, but you also go in and get you know what Mike thought what Mark thought and what other people kind of thought. And sometimes that may have more relevance to you and Oregon. You may find, Hey, after tasting a couple of the wines, Mike recommends that I like it. I can start following what other things he's recommending and go from there. He may not be an expert, but if his palate is close to mind right, then that's a wet. Yeah, And again, the thing that comes to the charge, though, So the free part of it is the vintage charts and other features. But the majority of the functionality is a paid subscription. Yeah, and I don't think we mentioned how many of these air paid or unpaid or mixed. So, you know, you just kind of if one of these sounds good, go check it out. And if it's you know, I saw some of them are monthly subscription. Some of them are one time and the five bucks or whatever it may be, some are free, you know, etcetera. So when if you find one that that that you like and or looks good. And the price is right. Go with it. If not, then. Ah, keep searching. Thank you. Okay, I got any others. Ah. Ah. The spectator had one as well. Oh, nice. Okay. Just called wine readings. Plus again, a lot of recommendations in there, um, feedback. And someone. So what you'd expect from them? Yeah. Yeah. And I do like I do like them as well and actually think for me personally, I tend to lean a little bit more towards some of their ratings and stars than I do want enthusiasts. Not that one. Enthusiasts are good. I just think, my pal, it's closer to Wine. Spectator's agreed. But what might If? And this is one that I was very excited about, Although I did not find a CZ much as I had hoped. Let's be honest. What if you've got a collection of wine, right? And you want to track it on, you know, get a feel for it and just really know what you have in your cellar. There might be an app for that. I wish I had that problem to start with. Uh, yeah, it is kind of hard. I actually had. I do have that problem. And every time I tell myself I'm not gonna I'm gonna drink what's in the cellar and Ah, because I need to make it disappear a little bit. Uh, then I like I'm doing today. Walk away with more wine, of course. But what I think for me, this is also wondering why I think this is kind of key to me is I do have, But she's I everything. I don't know, It varies. I'm somewhere probably around 250. Now I may be up closer to three again. I I drank town 22 50 with the intent of getting well under 200 Alex that I think I'm closer to three again. But that said, one of my challenges is I'm never quite sure what to do. Drink, right, cause I I will go there, and I'm like, Well, I don't want a drink this bottle, because I have something I have, like, sequential years. So I've got, like, you know, several years in a row, and I don't want to take one out of the middle and drink it and then go out late and go like Oh, no. I ruined my you know, my but vintage flight. I guess it is, or whatever it may be where I don't want to drink one that I only have one of maybe this time. But if I know I have three, I can, you know. So I think that's where having some of this in one place would be extremely helpful for me. I think a lot of people to, um I want to know when to drink the wines and not forget. Yes. So people usually have people labels on drink this after this date. Great way to track. It would be one of the Alps. Yeah, and that is that is another big one. Because things will. You can't over age wine, and you can also Ah, I guess you can't underage. But you could drink it when it's a little on the younger side. Whereas it's like and again if I've got to make a decision. And here's one that might be better in a year or two. And here's one that's like in its prime, I should probably drinking the prime so well, that said, um, I found two in here. Oh, no. If you found any out? All mention to you as well. Okay, well mentioned when you mentioned one. We'll see if we have the same too. Um so I've got Seller tracker. My understanding is it's not super user friendly as far as its interface, but that said, it does have the barcode on the wine label scanner, which I think is huge, especially if I've got, you know, 200 plus bottles. And I've got to go through an enter all of these. And so I would love one, because I have or had actually an Excel spreadsheet and the ability to just upload that. But I don't have that anymore. Or at least it's so out of date that I'm gonna have to redo it. So that's why I'm kind of rethinking. Maybe I should do it in an app, but if somebody has that, it would be great if you could just, like, suck it up in there. But they can't do that, at least not that I saw. If any cellar tracker people are out there, let me know. I would love to be able to do that, and then it is an additional fee, but I thought this was kind of cool and fun is it will value your collection. Oh, wow. Yeah. So kind of, you know, this is about what your wine collection is worth. Which I think for me would booth both good and bad, right? Interesting and exciting. It might be good for, um, sort of insurance claims if you wanted to know. Oh, brilliant. Very brilliant. Okay, yes, that's politics. Here's what's in my cellar. And here's what somebody independent of me says it's worth cause if you ask me, every bottle is at least 1000 bucks had $10. There you go. All right. And so would you. Have I had Ah, vino cell. Ah, which takes place. Ah, nice looking interface. So at least gives you that and ah allows you to scan up to 40 different data fields. You can plug in an information name, vintage occasion, and whatever information I want to put in there as well. Ah, And then you can also do certain things around, including kissing notes. You condition rating on there as well. Our recommendations repairing So has a good database for all that. Nice. So I'm gonna have to check those out. And I wish there were more options. I was actually honestly surprised that there wasn't more out there. Um, maybe it's not that big of an issue or the people. It is an issue for our, you know, so, uh, meticulous that they're already doing it all on their own. But I would have thought there would be more. Yeah. Ah, And do keep mind more and more in this day and age people of drinking line as soon as it by him, so less and less people are stirring one. Well, we did do the aging episode. I keep doing all these throwback references. I don't know why. It's just fitting today, but on the aging episode that really if you to sum up that one, it was drink your wine and drink it. Now, on that 99 out of 100 cases, you don't want to store that thing for very long, so that may definitely speak to it as well. I think, um, I think that maybe on the bottling episode we did didn't we do that? And it's like it average time that a wine lasts from when it's open from when it's bought two. Whenever it's it's something like it's, it's a matter of hours. I want 48 hours or less or something like that from when you buy until it's consumed. I think it was that episode. It was we did talk about that. I don't understand. All right? Yeah. I need to go back to listen to that one too. So there's a lot of listening to do if you haven't been keeping up guys out there. Yes. Yes. And we got two more categories here. So, uh, the next one is kind of events, wind events and wine tastings. So, uh, would you kind of find that direction Well ah, with a brilliant name. One events. That's the app that I found. Yeah, brilliant. And keep it simple. They have They're tied. Thio website powered by local wine of inch dot com. I think for a lot of people who want to find the event near you a supposed to just trying to go on Facebook or whatever. Maybe two great single stores to find that information. Ah, food wining trips, getaways. If you're traveling to location, you can also look up when you're traveling. Tow not bus. Noma wherever you may be, Um, and find it and sort of happy near you. So, um, they also have a discount ticketing options for some of the events. If you used the apse a good little way to also take advantage of it. Yeah, and I think that's because when I travel, I like to, you know, check out, um, you know, winds near me. Anna and I have always said, and many things drink local when you can read, You know, if you're gonna be in an area, check it out. And it may not be an area that's known for wine, but that does not mean that it's gonna be bad wine. So check it out and explore. Or if you're gonna go somewhere and you'll know when to go planet around event. Yeah, There you go. Like that. I like that. And then also to it's again, it's it's small stuff. It's big stuff. So it's It's not just wineries and tastings. It it could be I known art and wine fair or something like that, too. So there's there's something out there for everybody there. Let's see. Uh, you got any other ones in there? No, Okay. I did find Ah winery passport. Oh, yeah, right. Ah, And that one is again. Now that one's more tasting specific. So it will help you find local wineries again, Wherever you are, wherever you're going to go, you can pull again. And then what kind of fun? If you're, you know, wanna Gamification a little bit here because you can collect passport stamps at all the different wineries You go. So you can, you know, have more stamps and everybody else. E I get 10 stamps today. Today? That's busy day on. Are you still breathing? Is the question okay? And so we actually threw some into our final category, which is kind of miscellaneous slash other. I think you had a few for that. I think somehow or another, I managed to fit most of mine in there, So, yeah, I found a pretty cool one called corkage fee. Um, so not every restaurant has a great wine. Selection is kind of their, um, trademark here. So instead of trying to find wine at, ah, wine, a restaurant that you don't really know has good wine, you could bring your own so great weight. And nowhere to bring your own wine. If you have a good selection with friends and you can bring, not every restaurant allows you to bring your own wine. So great way to find out where you can bring it. What corkage fee is if they have one. If you don't have one, bring the one where you wanna go. I like it. I like it and that I've actually done that a few times now. I never really used to do it, but sometimes it again just got a good bottle of wine and you want to drink it, or I've had it where And we talked about this again past episodes where you go to it. Ah, a particular place. And on the menu is red wine. Yeah, and that is your obvious. And so if I'm going to place like that, But I know and I because I love the food, right. But I don't have a good wine with it. Then I'm gonna want that. That's, um, great. You know, tools right there to kind of work around that or just call ahead or, you know, and sometimes you actually I think once we had it was and some of the corkage fees. Could be kind of Steve. Yeah, but we got the wine at a discount. By the time we paid the corkage fee, it we kind of broke even almost, you know, So, uh, something to think about or maybe get a wine is a gift cost, you know? There you go. Yeah, we get paid corkage. Alright. You didn't really get uh okay. Do you have any other white naps either? Wine app? No, I think that's all I've gotten. Just those couple there, Okay? Yeah. And and it's It's a it's a big world out there. And this was not all. Of course, these are some of the bigger ones that are there, but so if any of these are a problem for you, hopefully we found an app that can solve that problem. And if not, then, uh, maybe somebody out there needs to develop a nap. And if we you if we miss one that you like, let us know? Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Reach out. Let us know I will export and check it out as I'm going to do with some of these. And if you're an app developer, maybe we just gave you some good ideas. Like that cellar tracker, Our cellars. Oh, seller trackers one, but some that celery and one. I think there's some space. Ah, some space there to get a nice, easy friendly interface that you just go Click, click, click, click through. Have everything you need. Amy. I'm just throwing that out there for anybody who wants me to work with them to develop that and give it to me for free. What? Did someone say something? Um, okay, well, I think that's that's everything we have for this, then. So, um, where can we get a hold of Oak Tree Winery? I'm sure there's people. Now they're sitting there. Well, you've been on here a few times, and they may not have figured out where to find you and how to get your wine perfect. Well, the best way to find this right now is a tree winery dot com I captured by our wines online. We do shipped to a lot of states here in the U. S. Ah, if you hear local in the sand is a bay area can also, um, smile with a delivery and give you some of our wine as well. So, um, to keep us in mind the next time you're buying some morning locally. Nice. Please do and keep the unsophisticated palate in mind when you're looking for a podcast and definitely recommend us. Tell friends. And again, as we mentioned, give us thoughts, recommendations, feedback, anything you got on what we've done today. Ah, and I think until next time, drink responsibly. Cheers. Cheers."

This week Marc is joined by Josh from Thumbprint Cellars to do a wine and cheese pairing and discuss the how and why it happens. We delve into several other topics along the way so grab some cheese, pour yourself some wine, and learn more about what's in your glass!

A podcast about all things wine, beer and spirits. Join us each week as we drink and delve into different alcohol related topics. I'm Mark and I'm Josh. Cheers. Oh, that's good. Oh, yeah, real nice. That's very good. So what a day like today. This is our 2016 arousal blend. This is a blend of about 70% of Vienna, and 30% reverts to a meaner now sourced from all over Sanoma County. The being it comes from Knights Valley, and he diverts his dry creek valley. Nice. And it's nice and cold, and you're right. Perfect on the hot seat on a hot day. It's got a good amount of body to it that can support itself, but just really clean. He's drinking. All right, all right. I'm gonna steal another sip of this while energy. Josh, uh, welcome, Josh. Drawn in the apartment having me, you are the tasting room manager at Thumbprint Sellers here in Healdsburg is correct. Been here almost eight months now. Relocated from the Bay Area, moved up to Sonoma County, but loving it ever since. How can you not? It's very hard. I mean, every time I come here, I'm like I need to find a way to say Exactly every day I'm on my daily commute through the Russian River Valley and driving through vineyards, these back roads. Just a nice reminder of how ridiculously likely we are up here. It's It's absolutely insane. Yeah, and it's good you still have that appreciation, you know, because, you know, you know, hopefully never hit to that point. We're just driving by it every day and you don't even carry. You don't even notice. It would be hard not to. It's especially right now. You know. All of the vines are just full of grapes. Full clusters. It's so green, it's lush, it's it's it's high energy. Everybody's picking and their tractors everywhere. It's just so exciting to down the area is absolutely beautiful, and I noticed that I'm driving here on the way. Those there's grapes just massive. Yeah, things again was hanging right off. It's created a lot of people's picking has been delayed because of all that water we got in February March. We had really bad flooding in March on DSO. It just kind of pushed everything back a couple of weeks actually at thumbprint. We've only have a small portion of our grapes picked on and were kind of just sitting around waiting on the rest of them now, not sitting around there. Certainly stuffing things were happening. But typically a typical harvest would have kicked off early September. That's not saying that's a little unusual from one little I know, right? Yeah, exactly. So And even the grapes were getting two weeks ago on the Thursday two weeks ago, we had our little harvest kickoff celebration. We had some sand and Pino grapes in there, and they were just just big suckers. They were so full, so lush they were delicious. So everything's coming in, just ready to go. This is gonna be that 2019 vintage, right? Yes. So keep your eyes open. Years, you'll see him pop up. But some people are calling for it to be similar to the 2015 vintage I've heard, which was a fantastic year. But that was funny enough one of the last drought years that we had. So we have the complete opposite end of the spectrum here with a very, very wet year to start, so we'll see what happens It's always kind of a guessing game, but it's fun. Nice. Nice. Okay. And so the first time we have anybody onto we always like to ask a little bit about your history or relationship with alcohol. So totally Ah, really? You know, as a young kid, didn't really drink ever in high school. I think I drink once or twice with my brothers when they were house sitting or someone a good kid. You know, I really behaved myself, Uh, about that I really had a choice. I just didn't know any better. And then I got to college and really discovered what a lot of college kids D'oh! You know, plastic handles of gross vodka, bagged wine. And I was in college when four Locos were sell a thing. Okay, Original recipe for locals to now, what's four? Loko Loko is a malt liquor drink that was originally really injected with a lot of caffeine. Oh, okay. Yes, And I think they killed some people. I think I remember that. Fortunately not you, not me. We made it through. But that was really the intro into alcohol. Drinking was the really not fun stuff. And you know that natty lights and things like that. A lot of 19 year old kids could get their hands on, right. So just got it. That was my start into just alcohol in general. And then I got in tow wine at the age of 22. I actually was just looking for a serving job, and I went to school in San Jose State. So in the Los Gattis area, I gotta serving job this really incredible little wine bar down there, an Italian wine bar. And I literally the only one I knew was the stuff that came out of a bag. At that point it up to that point, I had had stuff that came out of a bag or like one of those big jugs you could get from a grocery store. Yeah, cheap, because I was very classy. College kids. Drink what you can get your hands on what you can afford. Absolutely. Um and so I ended up landing this really incredible job, the really cool wine bar, and just immediately got introduced to absolutely incredible lines. It was apart. Retail shop, part wine bars. So we had about 300 wines on the retail shelf 15 20 wines by the glass on the menu and just kind of got tossed into the deep end Drinking really, really interest. Some of those had to be just, like, blown your mind. All right, My mind. I'll never forget the first time I tasted, uh, like a riel Cabernet sauvignon, like, Not like a knock off. You know, you paid off the lease, you know, something that was a legitimate one, and I didn't really know how to process it. And it just kind of blew my mind from there. And then I just kind of fell in love with trying all the weirdest stuff. I get my hands on your Morello. Masculine is your Allah go take things like that that I just nobody else knew about it and nobody was talking about Oh, I have to try this. Yeah, Yeah, I just ran and ran with it from there. Yeah, and I'm very similar to I mean, I remember my still the state, my very first. That wine, that's like, this is why people talk about why you line one line and you just like I don't know. It's okay. That's what old people drink. What guys drink. You know, it's not. It wasn't something in my mind that was accessible and especially growing up in San Jose. You're right by the Santa Cruz Mountains. There's a lot of really small producers out there that are doing incredible things. Amazing things, you know that. You know, I didn't realize any of that was right there and that I could appreciate it as well. So that really opened the door to understanding what was there and what I could do with it. Nice, nice. And then brought you here to Thumbprint Sellers. Sellers. Yep, I got it. I got away for wine from wine for a bit. You know, growing up in San Jose again, really thought Tech was the only option that did that for a bit and realize that wasn't for me. So I was looking around at what I should be doing myself having 1/4 life crisis. I like that to start early. Gotta get it out of the way then. And the rest of life is gravy. Um, and we just gotta looking around, thinking about what I wanted to pursue and was looking actually into Cinema State has their wine institute Yes, I was looking for a master's program through there, the MBA and wine business. But then I decided I should probably not be a bum and get a job first. Okay, that's probably wise. And so, yes, so that led me up. Here I met with are the owners Scott America, and we all kind of fell in love with each other and decided to come on board. It's been a great time ever since. Nice, Nice. So tell me little bit about thumbprint sellers for those who don't know. I know cause I've got several friends who are actually wine club members, and they've dragged me here a few times, not kicking or screaming very happily. So. So tell us a little bit about thumbprint sellers who you guys are. What makes you unique? Totally. So we are on Artisan Winery. So will you make less than 5000 cases a year about now? We're making probably about 4500 cases a year. Our owner winemakers Scotland's from Dick, entirely self taught hey had grown up between kind of San Francisco and his parents have some property appears So you've been in the wine around wine. His entire life. Self taught winemaker actually studied art, get bashed to find art from Dominican College. And he spent ah year in Italy studying Renaissance art and fell in love with the idea of winemaking. So when he came back, he decided that he was going to teach himself how to do it. So his wife bought him a book on wine making. I picked up some grapes and just started making wine in his garage. The thumbprint actually is his thumbprints okay, because all the bottles have, ah, some prejudice. This is the perfect conversation for an audio medium. But I eso when he was first starting out, he would fill a glass with his wine and right on the bottle what was in there and one time that paint pen he was using exploded all over the bottle as he's trying to clean it up, Left a thumbprint on one of the bottles really liked how it looked. So we did it on a bunch of other ones in his life. Took it to a holiday party, and everybody started referring to it Is the thumbprint wine. Okay, 25 years later, we're going strong. That makes that I like that. It's a fun little story that the thumbprint on there is. It's only about a 90% accurate rendition of his S O. I can't take it to go, you know? Yeah, It used to be his actual thumbprint, but then when the technology were like, You probably don't want to do that. Yeah, I only wise. Yeah. So we source all of our grapes so we don't actually have any of our own vines. We do have our production facility out in the south part of guys Orville out Alexander Valley, where we do produce all of our wine. But we source primarily from this force surrounding valleys of Healdsburg, Alexander Valley, Knights Valley, Russian ever and Dry Creek. Yeah, and anyone who's familiar with wines knows most of them. Exactly. Northern California wines. Those are some of the best, Uh, what they called the ace Aviation. Thank you. Yes. Now what? We're here today to Dio and I got I had to kind of stop myself from you. Step on this, Uh, because it's delicious, but we're doing because you guys one of the things you guys do that a little bit unique, which I thought was awesome and see if we can walk. Today is the way you do your tastings. You taste them with cheeses or other things, like chocolates with your porch, things like that. So tell me a little bit about that, and then we're actually gonna go through and do a tasting and really kind of understand how that's affecting the flavors and all that other kind of totally. So it's It's something that we've been doing about a year now, and it just highlights what you can do with wine. Wine doesn't just have to be something that you pop open a bottle, and I have a glass after a long day at work or after it celebration or something like that. It could be something that you used to enhance a dish you're making, or if you've made a dish and you have a bottle of wine sitting around something that you can pop open and really, really dig into. So it kind of highlights aspect of wine and wine tasting in the whole wide experience that a lot of people don't really think about. I mean, I can't tell you the amount of times every single week when I'm I'm interacting with guests and they're like, I didn't I've never even thought about pairing wine with food, which, to me blows my mind because that's just how it works for me. But it's It's such a nice way to illuminate another aspect of it for people that might not ever have that opportunity. Yeah, and most of time. I mean, I think we did a wine parent episode a while back, but a lot since I think people think of the wine is one thing in the food is owed another right? You don't always put it together, But most of time when you're drinking, I mean, at least for me. Anyway, you're also eating right? You would hope. Yeah, I Yeah, I think there might be. You might need to look into that. Yeah, it's it is true. And a lot of people to for wine parents. Ah, lot of a lot of places do really big seated five course things where we just d'oh very simple half ounce little pieces of cheese, not even 1/2 ounce of cheese with maybe a little fruit topping or something like that to just pick and pick apart those little things to help highlight certain aspects of each one that you're drinking. It doesn't have to be this over blown big thing. It's just a simple as look at this little Citrus note as it compares with this white line that you're drinking and it totally can open up any bottom line. Yeah, and and I've had that happen before, which is why I'm like when you suggested that we do this. I'm like, That's brilliant because I've had tastings where? And I've never fully had it explained to me. So hopefully we're gonna be, oh, a little bit more today, at least more than I did, which is just, I know that I would taste the wine that I would taste the cheese. I would taste in wine, and it's almost like two different want. Totally. Yeah, and do you have any insight into kind of how or why, that were somewhat, You know, for example, like with a lot of fatty, your cheeses, like the lipids, will bind with your taste buds and basically create a coating that will enable different taste buds to function in different roles. Internet may have just entirely made that up but I think that's great. You know what I believe it's going to be? Oh, but but things you know, such as Maybe if there's like the first pairing that we're gonna get into it has a what is effectively a jelly on it, which has a higher sugar content. And it's paired with ah, blend that really doesn't have much residual sugar on there. And that's that's what we're drinking American Right now. This is our 2016 arousal blend, so this is about 70% Vienna and 30% coverage demeanor. And so, with the church means white wine, white wine, I, over simple find it a little bit even partly for me because, honestly, if I just heard those great names, I think I would have thought they were whites. But I want to confirm for those that's totally is so unique. Traditionally grown in the Rhone region, the Rhone Valley, France, and give her demeanor if you can't tell from the names for German great think Riesling similar to okay, Riesling, CAF, flavor profile. God so and our pairing on the cheese. This is a sheep's milk cheese. It's a lamb chop Trees from Cypress Grove Cree Marie Pretty mild sheep's milk cheese and the pairing that is on top of it. It's a little jellies, uh, referred to as Rosie's hip jelly. It is effectively a rose hip Jell O. Okay, they have some standard, I think. And I'm sure somebody can fact check this, but I think they have to have certain parts per volume of rose hips to qualify as a rose hip jelly. Okay, that makes sense. It made a little loophole here. Okay, That's why it's Rosie, Rosie, possessive, apostrophe on. They're going to get around it close, but not all the way that way. Yeah, exactly. Um, so yeah. Okay, let's dig in. So first we what do you talking? So why wine? Drink it all the way through. Smell it, You know, get to know it. I know what we're friends. Yes, what I like to dio typically is then eat the cheese she went through, and then there's just a little bit left in your mouth. Finish the wine. Okay, then that'll kind of reintroduce everything all together, and we'll see what we get. Okay, So just right here and pick up one of these little, little messy there. So it's all good. You get a little bit more of that. Rosie's roses hit jelly. More chewing for those who don't know. Well, maybe have some of this out. Maybe not. Maybe a little. Listen to us, you know. Okay, wait till you go a little bit, like, you know, coat the mouth of that. Okay, now we go. Wow. Totally. It's like two different wine. Exactly. It's a how would you describe the difference? Because, I mean, I'm finding it's almost like a little sweeter, a little bit more mellow, little less acidic liquid cheese. You're very, very correct. So what I like to think about this is when we do our Govert stra meaner and that's 30% of this wine. We do it in a very dry style, traditionally done quite sweet with, you know, 10 20 grams for leader of residual sugar. In you know or more, we d'oh less than one gram per liter of residual sugar. Well, very, very dry. But when you add in that Rosie's it jelly, it's a pretty sweet jelly. It kind of reinvigorates the sugar content of what you're tasting, so it really kind of blends in with that green apple, The white light fruit on the wine there and just kind of mellows everything out less acid driven, more of a body to it. Okay. And I totally noticed that I could get up. Okay. Actually, I like that. Yeah, that's super mild. Just easy going, you know, doesn't linger. Clean. Yeah. It's such a nice just like today. Warm, hot, easy going. Yeah, little cheese. A little A little nice. Nice wine. Afternoon. Right. Life is hard for us. So difficult. My goodness. So now, with this just experiment is how you kind of came around to this particular cheese and jelly already much. Yeah. Again, in living or very difficult life, we have to practice a lot. So you have to understand that gaze Sheep's milk cheese. If it's pretty mild, I might want to support it with something that has a little bit of a body, but not necessarily tannins, which for those that don't know tannins. The thing in the wine that basically sucks the moisture out big, bold reds, you'll be feel very tannic in the mouth because it just eliminates all moisture there with and mild light cheese like that that might kind of interfere too much, so it just requires a lot of practice. At a certain point, you kind of begin to understand that certain flavor profiles with certain wines should in theory go well together. But it's not an exact science doesn't always apply. So and that's one thing if anything that I've definitely learned here is you know, doing this podcast is that, you know, a lot of those just practice, right? Just It's tough, you know? She's a drink. Wine. We call him whenever we change our flights in the cheese parents we put, we get the cheese together on a board and sit down at our staff table. We call it our board meetings. Oh, that's that's cheesy as it sounds. And I like my good. Uh, you just get him all worked up there right now. My my God, it just it does require that you can think it's gonna taste one way, But until you taste it, it it could be the worst parent ever. Yeah, I have to know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've heard that in other things, like certain ingredients or whatever and indifferent the things I like in the gin episode or whatever they like this. It's got the aromas, it's got. This is about that. And then as soon as you, you know, brew it, distillate in there all the time, it's like, Yeah, I know where that is. Absolutely the same thing. It looks like it makes sense and you try it be not so much so much, but it's just an old trialling there, you know, has a lot of winemaking is there's certainly theories and plans and things that should work and things the ways that they should go. But you I kind of got in there and taste out of the barrel. Sometimes that's just you need to know where it's at now. If I was putting together a party or something, then I could probably even porn thumbprint wine, because why would you pour me doing anything else? Okay on. So I could even kind of probably if I've given enough time, reach out to you guys and just say, Hey, I'm pouring these ones. Absolutely. What? Cheese. If I want to do like a little charcuterie or something, whatever you guys say, Oh do. This is totally I get that I get asked that 45 times a week on Saturday, Somebody's buying some minor like a I'm taking this. Ooh, this thing later. You know, I have these three bottles. Which one should I take their serving? Whatever it was. Yeah. You know, it's like, Well, you probably do well with this, you know? And there's certainly failsafe ce in that occasion. Like, kind of Pino noir is kind of a cheat code because, like, a good, medium bodied pinot noir, that's not too jammy but not too dry. And I think that, like, that could go with anything, almost anything. So they're certainly outs to that. But it's also fun, like, Oh, you're going to a barbecue means sera. So, Ron barbecue Such a power combo. Okay, Notice? Yeah, you know, and actually, the one we're getting into now, Okay. Yeah, is also a great barbecue pairing. Okay, funny enough. So this is our 2016 Betsy's Vineyard, Vienna and Betsey's winners out Knights Valley, which is kind of east, northeast of where we're at in downtown Hillsboro right now. Okay. And so again, as I kind of mentioned we were talking about the rows of union is a traditional Rone grave from the Rhone Valley. You don't see it all too often as a standalone varietal, and it really I you know, I don't know the exact year when it really started taking off on its own, but maybe 20 years in the states that it's really been being produced as just a standalone, single varietal wine. It's typically used as a blending grape. People throw it in. You know, there's the and I apologize if I murder this. But the Cote Rotie style that's an area in their own valley, and the Coty style of making Suraj is too typically, do a certain percentage Sera. Call it 90% Suraj with 10% Vienna, too, whether it's mellow it out. And now Siradze red. And this is a white mix, a little white in the interesting Okay, exactly did not know that they had always assumed reds were read exactly what we do on a lot of our blends. We do have a lot of blends on gone. A lot of our plans, we will throw in 2% being a or something like that, just it again, melas it out or it adds a little bit more flavor, complexity, layers of that. It just really depends on when the winemaker's taste in. Yeah, well, see what's going on. Give it a shot. See what happens. Nice. Okay, so let's try this, then. So 2016 Vienna. This one sees 25% malolactic fermentation, which is what gives chardonnay, that buttery body. And you could probably say right up front about to ask you to explain that. And yes. Oh, yeah, definitely, very buttery. And it only sees about 20% new French oak, and the rest is neutral oak. So you don't get a crazy amount of coke characteristics on this one guy mild, We d'oh, you mention this before we started recording. But we do refer to this one as the red wine drinkers. White wine. Okay, because it has more body to it. It's not. Yeah, keep buttery anything like that. Good, clean snow, like fruity right now. Does this acid? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What's mentioning as fruit and acid? Yeah, well, we have this. She's coming up to pair with this. This is our dry jack cheese and a little bit Dr. April on there. Okay, So right, so I just tried it and again, we're going to the same thing. She would up and get it to a point where it's so a little bit left him. Oh, I could eat so much of that cheese was about secondly, that straight forever. Okay, that's just crazy. Immediately bumps the acid up. Yeah, I haven't had that bearing in a while. I think that is good, actually. I mean, and that's I think, something that kind of keep in mind. Why? I kind of want to do this. So I guess it sounds like experimentation and or make a friend of your winery. Well, exactly, um, good people to know. Yes. Very good people to know. But it's one of those where it's like I mean, it was a good wine. I enjoyed that since I had the cheese with it. I mean, I would I would I would have drink it before now. Drink. There's good English. I would have consumed that. But now with this, I drink that all day with that cheese. I mean, first of all, the cheese was good. And then it was the way it changed. It changed the flavor in the wine. Yeah, that's a fun we've actually had that on the flight for a while because it's just I can't get rid of it. It's so good. Yeah, and and this is your standard tasting, right? This is it. This is our standard tasting five lines with five cheeses to whites, three reds and complimentary cheese. Paring on each of them. We try and keep The cheese is local is possible, but there aren't as many cream Aries out here as as I'd like. So we do have one from a different state. But everything else is pretty much within a couple of hours where every now and then it's crazy and it is unique because again, I've had, like, have a cracker, have, ah, small piece of chocolate. Exactly. Or maybe with this wine have this cheese but tohave like the full set up. That's awesome. Yeah, great. And it's just it's fun, you know, it really draws people in 22 because, especially in Healdsburg, being so close to Napa, Napa can be very intimidating for people that aren't in tow. Wine people. A lot of younger people coming up from San Francisco haven't really gone wine tasting before. We're not even younger that was true. Absolutely true. Um, actually, in fact, most of the people that I've never going wine tasting for it. Certainly not the 22 year olds coming up. All right, so I'm not alone. I'm not alone by any means, but it's just a good way to kind of introduce people to more than just our wine. Hey, look at this school thing you can do with it. Yeah, it's well, really brings it full circle to kind of what we were talking about earlier. Yeah, yeah. Which I think again. It is really understanding the wind learning about the wine because, like, I knew very little. So, you know, I started asking questions and things, but you know, and again, you get little bits of this, and I think again, it just helps give you that perspective. But then I didn't know. And this is the thing to remember. Oh, yeah. Ask questions. Absolutely. You know, find friends and or you get conversations, even follow up later. And that's something I think I was always afraid to do. I didn't want to sound stupid, right? There's there's so many different things that impact every part of not only wine but wine tasting in the whole wide experience. Ask all of the questions. I mean, I we love answering them. That's what we d'oh you know, That's a quote of the podcast right there. Ask all of the questions. I love that because that is so true and I mean it with wine. But I think everything absolutely, but definitely you know anything you're drinking again. This is mine. Beer, spirits, whatever. Don't be afraid to ask questions. I'll be afraid at all. Because just the other day I had, somebody asked me a question and I didn't know the answer, and it was driving me insane. So I sat there for 20 minutes and research that we all have computers in front of us. I can google things kind of how we got through college. And not only does that further your own education, but now I'm further educated in my own industry. And yet I would have never thought of this question to ask. So you're really benefiting more than just yourself by asking these questions and it's fun t be able to educate somebody. I mean, I'm very passionate about this. I want to share that gash in with other people. That's why I'm in this industry. And that's why we have the catheter and everything like that. Sheriff, I think I've over. I've loved and I've said that before. Yeah, never has a line, but while I was, there's been times where I've been places in the person next, me acid and I just kind of leaving. No, absolutely. I don't want to know what they're saying. What's going on over there? What's the answer? It's all, you know, big educational experience. But you also get to during great wine, have fun. Yeah, life is good. Life is good. So what are we What are we doing? This is our 2014 malbec. So this is from Dry Creek Valley. Jamie Schmidt Vineyards. One of the was primarily source from very, very small, great performers. Only a couple of the families that resource our grapes from make their own lines. Okay, So primarily, you know, pretty much just great farmers. That's a big industry up here as well. So that's got a great nose right on the taste delivers just bright fruit screaming through nice oak notes on there as well. And I'm more of a red drinker than a white drinker. So before I leave today, remind me I'm buying a bottle to or that I'm taking it with making started. I know a guy would get me. Oh, good, good. Oh, that's delicious. Yeah. So malbec really kind of didn't gain a lot of traction as well. Until recently. It's going a lot in South America. Um, and people just kind of forgot about it. It's one of those board over idols that people just kind of forgot about it. Susan blends and hands like that, but, you know, Mom Beck kind of just was there, but never like, Oh, I'm here, you know? Yeah. And so it's it's gets getting also there also there. Yeah, like that. The other one, you know, off of caps off cap. Franck. Even more low. Before sideways happened, merlot was taking off, and then that movie came out. It's coming back, though. Yeah, um and so it's fun to be able to showcase varietals such as like a malbec. Could we do a carignane? Petite fur does things like that. Not a lot of people have heard off. You know, I even cab Franck some people don't really have a lot of knowledge on, so it's really fun to be able to showcase. He's not your cab sobs. You're Pinos in your chardonnay. So yeah, ones that I think I associate anyway, mostly with blends, right? Exactly. Exactly. Yep, primarily used to support a big, bold Bordeaux blend and release, mellow it out a little, hollow it out exactly, because they could be temperamental grapes harder to do on their own. So many factors that go into it. So it's it's it's good to be able to be like, Hey, here's the thing you've never heard of subs and fun with it. Yeah, you know, Speaking of which, okay is yes, cheese. So? So this moving down the line we have It's a goat Buddha Goat cheese from Central Coast Cree Marie. Excuse me and has a sour cherry spread on there, which I could be buried in and eat my way out. Okay, that is that is exciting. I have to try this now. Oh, wow. He said, Sauer rising of sour. But it's not. It's not. No. Okay, you could bury me in that way. It is sold now with the wife. Was the one. I need it more cheesy I want It's amazing, right? Totally game changing. It really, really is what I like about the goat. Good, because goat cheese has, you know, that quote unquote barnyard taste. It's a little game, your taste and it brings those elements into the wine is very bright and pretty healthily. OKed Wine gets another little layer in there to just kind of make it a little bit more complex as well. Yeah, now I've had a couple sips and that stays with you for a little bit. It doesn't go away right away, so you don't have six around cheese, wine, cheese, wine. You can cheesy line cheese one. But then why wouldn't you? Yeah, I go to the expert. There's no wrong way to do it. Just personal preference, I guess. I don't know cheese. Every other seven. That's fair. That's a good way to do it. I'd say that's the right way. Absolutely. What do we got moving on? So one of our flagship wines here is there 2015 cabernet franc from Aram Azadi Vineyards. OK, that's what we were just talking about. Just about cab from one of those exactly get typically a blending, typically blending. You know, uh, it's my first introduction to Capt. Frank was a very old world style cap. Franck, I think I was probably 22 when I drink it for the first time. And then I didn't touch it again for probably five years for a young talent such as my you know I had at the time. Very old world style wines can be awful, I guess is that when they would put it, it's not what you're used. Thio. It's very different style. Earthy, acid driven, lighter alcohol, things they're not used to. Where if you've been drinking California, Pinos or California cabs right of fruit, more characters out of the boxes out of the exactly. But even then, yeah, just some of the more basic wines it's gonna have. A very you're saying different, distinct, different, very distinctive. You know, Maur pepper notes, Green pepper, black pepper almost hot to the taste sometimes because it's it's just very earthy. You know, not you're approachable without a slab of meat or something. Yeah, I need some temporary exactly, Exactly. So this cat from our 2015 caf Frank, it's actually 100% varietal. Okay, a lot of times you will see this blended with maybe another one of the Bordeaux varietals and merlot or a mall back or even a capped off or something. It's such this is 100 samurai. It'll seize a mix of about 15% new French and 15% new American oak and the rest neutral oak. So you do get some of those Oh, characteristics some vanilla from the front jokes in a man notes from the American. Yeah, I'm getting that. And we didn't episode on barreling there. You don't want no more. I'm barreling Go back and listen to that one. It was It was a good one, actually, I was saying was for that one, actually. Oh, I did see that. That's right. It wasn't good. I'm not saying it was good. I'm just saying, roll out the barrel so it's gotta be done. But this is good. Okay, Another bottle will be taking home. There you go. Yeah, this one. Catherine has been one of our flag ships for quite a while. The owner winemaker Scott, his wife Erica. They're co owners. Excuse me. Um, when he was first starting out he was bringing home samples of juice to kind of figure out his blends and stuff, and he brought home a sample of the cat Franck, and they were sitting down to kind of taste and figure out what they wanted to. Dio and Erica tasted the cab drunk. So let's do that. We'll know these samples I brought him. But why can't we just do that? That's good. Go just just stick with it. So her favorite Rydell cap Franck, also with her favorite color, gray green, right there. Dying love. As always, Yes and that, And I can see why that might be, if you're not used to it again, used to more cabs or more mellower, exactly captains in a mellow wine like a piano. Or, you know, something like that. How well, that would be a little different. It might be a little bit much, but if you got a pout, that's that's good and of itself. I do like that little peppery, totally. You know, it's lights. It's not as aggressive as some of those very traditional ones are. Yeah, it does not overpowering, but it's definitely there. It's there for sure. It's got a body to support and very light tannic structure so that you know that they're there. But they're not. You know, they're not the belle of the ball of the wine. They're not stealing the show. I like that. That's a perfect way to say I like that. Yes, Uh, really fun pairing on this one. This is a six month aged cheddar from Shelburne Farms are out in Vermont, actually, Um, with a dried blueberry and blueberries with this wine is, I think, my favorite bearing I've ever had to be really very anything. Blueberry pie, blueberry ice cream, blueberries fresh off a bush, whatever it is. All thanks very much. A great pairing with this, Captain. Yeah. Okay, so we're gonna try this out, and this is the trees from another state. And stay there. One that's not local. Okay, because if it works, it worked. They're doing great things out there. I mean, I do like Look, I mean, locals, always good. It's good cheese. And now yeah, her cheese and wine. Like I will have wine and I'll have it with food. Yeah, but I rarely have it with cheese. And again, I'm noticing that doesn't it doesn't take a whole lot. I mean, these are very small slices pieces, and you could probably have I mean, half of that. Even 1/3 of that small by. Yeah, I still get the same if absolutely. Yeah, yeah, it's very powerful. Little tasting tool. This is dangerous. I like it a lot, but like the fun kind of dangerous everybody enjoys it. The best kind. Yeah, absolutely. The kind that should be there. All right. All right. So are, sadly to our last bottle. Last one here. I mean, I do have some more stuff open downstairs, but waken do that off the record there. You know, I never happened or did I Don't care. Y'all are missing. You got to come to some great and an experience downtown heels right off the square. And it is downtown little tasting room. And there's that cool little square out there. It's like, Come out, get some wine. Crop of victory. Seriously at a time, you hang out in the square. It's so we're getting into the nice time of year where it's not that hot anymore. But we don't get in the race these rainy season yet, so Come on down. We're here every day of the week. Nice. So moving on here, This is one of our blends. So outside of the cap, Franck, I'd say, probably are. Other flagship lines are we do Bordeaux glands. And this is our redacted blend. And if you can see the label, it is descriptions actually redacted. It actually is. Eggs have been stricken from the record on that. Now, now, now I'm gonna be super curious. What words you guys redacted. It's on the label. The and the description. It's actually not the words black and out. Still trying to find that out. I don't have clearance for that s o. This reductive blend is a blend of 31% surat, 24% cabernet sauvignon, 21% malbec, 16% below 5%. 5% petite covered. Oh, excuse me. And 3% grow nosh on there. So primarily the Bordeaux varietals. And we just previous to this had an episode on bird Bordeaux varietals. So if you want to know more on those specifically, what are they and everything else, which I did definitely check that one out. But in the meantime, so those air So this is definite blend. And it's primarily you're saying primarily Ceron caps off, man. Malbec? No, but of them all back in there and arrest kind of tossed in there as well. You're coming home with more wind coming home with. That's what that says it tends to happen. Yes. Yes, this is actually I think I might know I drank it and say, I know I've brought home a bottle of the redacted read before because I actually remember being redacted on the label. Yeah, I'm not sure what else I brought. I think maybe the cab Franck was the other one. Anybody came with a couple of bottles, and the intent was to hold on to them and they didn't last. Very. I have that problem too high. I take bottles home, toe lay down quite a bit, and they've never made it. Look, it's enough for arrest. And you're gonna go right? Just, you know, take it. Show. Yeah, Tony, No sleeping beauty kind of lines ready to drink now? Yes. Eso are bearing on this. This is from Cowgirl Creamery, right on the coast. Over here. This is a wagon wheel cheese, and it has It's called a midnight in Paris GM what is effectively a pear butter. It's pairs, nutmeg and vanilla. So this one was kind of a tough parent to come up with that. That our last board meeting that we held, we went through four or five different things, trying to figure out what we're gonna pair with us. And, yeah, it ended up being the winner. And you just have a bunch of cheese out there. A bunch of like jams, fruits, jams, jellies, everything I think of. Yeah, it's really, really tough day at work. Now, here's the problem with that. I'm gonna actually, no, I'll tell you the problem with that. And then I'm gonna eat this. Is that you know, for me anyway, because you're tasting and you're you're probably spinning. Yeah, like they just get tasting better and better be garbage thing I've ever tasted. Yeah, and you're eating dirt. But, you know, we do a spit, at least to start. Yeah, and we've talked about that before. It's actually a good thing. Men, right? Circumstances. I mean, I recommend against it in general, and I'm talking with my mouth full fare. Apologies. You know, if you're tasting a lot, and we do a lot of those things from your driving. You know those kinds of things. Be smart and responsible, always drink responsibly, taste responsibly. And also, if you're chasing a taste palate fatigue is an actual thing. It does occur yes, typically after your first or second tasting. By the time you hit that third place, you're not really tasting wine like you should be. Yeah, so and I've done some marathon tastings. Oh, yeah, and they're fun. Yeah, but you're hitting that 15 6 place. Even the flight said that 3rd 4th even you're starting to push your limits. You're pushing the limits. I think it's the 30 0 yeah, exactly. And I think I've yet to have one of the 4th 5th Whatever stops I mean at the time think it's my favorite world, right? They never Everybody's awesome. The wine's amazing. Yeah, but then later you tasted it is never quite the same, and not only that, but then it's like I don't know that memory's not that I'm drunk, but it's just like, you know, I always Yeah, I seem to have a better memories. Fonder memories for this first few soon taste smart case intelligently. Yes. We've all heard the stories and probably have experienced it where you wake up the next day and you've joined three wine clubs? No, never. No. Actually, I think I have avoided that so far. I mean, I'm not to say I haven't joined wine clubs over the years, but I think I've managed to not do it in a, uh, influence. Yes, with the word too smart responsibility. It's It's very difficult. It is actually especially for an adult. So Yeah, no way around that for all of you episode. Okay, I'm telling you, it's like, actually, episode will just be Don't over. That's it. That's fine. Problem solved. So what you think of that parent, that was good. That was Yeah. Again. Same thing. I mean, it's amazing what that does to the one and how that pairs and again, how it just kind of I just can't think Mello's it out a little bit. Yeah, but in a good way. We're getting all the best of the wine. Absolutely is. And especially in something like a blend it, especially a six varietal blend. There's a lot going on, So they're certainly going to be something that right from the start, it's gonna really skyrocket into your palate. Well, if you do with a pairing, it can kind of mute that one thing and let the rest of it get settled in and really come forward as well. So it just adds those layers and complexity to the wine that you may not have otherwise even noticed. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, great. Well, any anything else you want to share? Any kind of parting words were going close to wrap up here or anything. You wanna come visit us? That's easy. That's easy enough. No. Yeah, we're we're We're always happy to host everybody. You know, we like to keep things pretty casual. I mean, in a baseball hat and shorts right now. And I'm working the floor. So we're approachable and casual. Andi like to have a good time here and really introduce people to things that it may not have otherwise ever seen. So come visit us. Yeah, and I like that about thumbprint. And I like that about just Healdsburg and Sonoma County. Think in general, it's It's a little It's a lot more, I think laid back casual come. It's a place to just come and hang out. Absolutely. And that's a briefly touched on it earlier. It's, you know, being in such close proximity to Napa, which Napa is the mecca of California American wine. Really? Yeah. And so Napa is is a fantastic place to go, but it's a little more intense, and it's a little bit more very established places and people and winemakers and things like that where you know, we're just west come on over a lot more laid back with still pretty, relatively undiscovered, in a sense, especially Healdsburg. A lot of people know of us, but most people really don't and so come in. And everywhere you go around here, it's just really laid back casual. I present to you very high quality products, but without a lot of the you know, the big show about it as well. It's a very approachable place to bay. Yeah, and I'll second that I mean again, go to Napa because it's Napa, right? You got it. But you gotta also either spend a day or two also over in Sonoma, or hop over or plan just a trip to snowmen. And I think I know that some people may still like Napa, but a lot of people that I know that I've tried both really enjoys a stopover. Totally. And it's It's certainly a trend that's occurring, that people. They're kind of more discovering Sonoma County because the market is changing so much for who is buying the wine. It's people that their parents went to Napa when they were growing up, and they don't want to do that. There were commented the different places to have just as good a wine but hang out with people that are not gonna lecture them on how to say certain words or how to taste or things like that and just have a relaxed, casual experience. Yeah, have some cheese and have some water and life is good life. It's perfect. Excellent. Well, there's just a little okay, we gotta pour just a little bit. You can't cheers with a sip. So that's good way. Need something Cheers with here at the end? How do we find thumbprint sellers? Yeah, other than all that other fun. Yes, So we shipped to pretty much all states, with exception of like Utah in Kentucky and Mississippi. But we can ship everywhere else, you can find this online. Thumbprint sellers dot com Find us on Instagram at thumbprint Sellers are pretty active on there, I find is that one of the math? It's in street in downtown Healdsburg. If you have any questions, you can give us a call or email us. I find all that information on the Web site and the instagram. Yeah, and then reach out, get some of the wine asked for the cheese parings that we've had today, or just re listen and make notes and and try it. It's awesome. So we're at the unsophisticated palate dot com again, If you want to reach out, contact us, tell friends, raid us all the other good stuff. Give us the stars. You know all the things the podcast want, right? I think that's it. So, until next time, drink responsibly. Cheers. Cheers"

Welcome to the unsophisticated palate podcast about all things wine, beer and spirits. Join us each week as we drink and delve into different alcohol related topics. I'm Mark. I'm Lauren. Cheers. Oh, that's delicious. Cabernet franc. That's a cab, franc. OK, that's very good. All right, we're gonna be tasting that a little bit more today. Uh, very good. So, Laura, welcome. You're the assistant tasting room manager at Soda Rock Winery here. In is it, technically, Healdsburg, Alexander Valley, Alexander Valley. Okay. Just outside of field, then in Alexander Valley, which I think most people who are familiar with wine You've seen Alexander Valley on the wine bottle Some well, on some wine bottle somewhere because it's a very I mean, it's a beautiful place, but also great for growing wine. It is. And it's for most people who don't know we're directly north of Napa. And this is our version of cab country up in Sonoma County. Okay? And I did not know that. So thank you were learning. I like that already. So as you know, first time anybody's on the podcast. We always ask a little bit about their history and our relationship with alcohol. So sure, it's whatever I like to joke about that and say that wine was in my bottle as a baby. So being born and raised here in the Bay Area, my dad from San Francisco, he grew up with wine. He grew up with a relationship with wine from around Italian families, and it's just always been part of my life. My dad introduced me to wine. I drink it as from a young age. I want to say, you know, probably in my teens at family dinners and things like that and really just had a passion for it. So I guess I got it from him and that I was chased around the tasting rooms as a little kid always sort of had that in me. So when I was finally 21 I was able to go tasting legitimate, we never stop. You ever stopped like that never stopped. So and I had a passion for it and just learned and learned. And I'm here following my passion than being able to make it into a career. Love it, love it. I mean, that's and that's the best. And I I also think the way your parents. That is way I kind of it with my kids. And I think it's crucial because, you know, it's it's that. And we've talked about that before on the podcast, when it's a secret or taboo or whatever, then then that's why kids go off to college and drink. You know, anything and everything to get their hands on right? But yeah, if you actually grow up around it and it's normal and it's natural that it's just another part of life and then you actually really can get the appreciation and enjoyment for it, I think, and not go crazy in college, right? Exactly. I saw I saw that happened when I was in college, but yeah, I agree. And we always had wine on the table. But, you know, I always sat down to dinner with my family, and wine was always on the table on holidays. It was about the lines that everybody brought, so it just it's just evolved in my life that way, out of curiosity, totally slightly off topic here. But now I've got to ask, because I because I actually didn't drink for most of my life, actually, so I'm just curious, having been somebody who kind of had that exposure growing up and then watching those kind of friends and stuff. What is that kind of like? I mean, you look at them and go like amateurs or something. I mean, I don't want to talk bad about it, but I'm just kind of curious about that perspective. You know, it's interesting. I definitely I think I had a different appreciation. I didn't go to college and go crazy. I did watch people. I watch people get sent home because they had never touched alcohol and they just went. They were finally away from Mom and Dad went crazy where I probably was drinking wine and college versus my friends as well. You know, uh, give you experience. I moved to Las Vegas for about a year, so glad I moved back. I was only one of everyone that we hung out with the drunk wine and they made fun of me for being a wine drinker. Not a beer drinker. Tequila drinker, whatever. Yeah, but it's just always been part of my life. So it's what a joy. Yeah, and I think at that age, too, it is a little unusual. T be drinking wine in the twenties and especially, you know, And if you are, it's probably out of the box. Or it's the, you know, super cheap bottles that you can get. Yeah, well, I didn't say, but having that and growing up that way is awesome. So we're here on site at Soda Rock Winery Way. I discovered you. I've been a soda rock fan for years, and I actually was used to ride my bike on. They had a couple triathlons or whatever that I was part of that would go by here, and I came by here several times and I looked at the building. That's a very unique architectural design. Looks like a Western motif. People think it looks like a Western set. We should film a movie here. Yes, totally. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I remember this. It was like an old post officers. It was so the building, the original majority parts of the building was a It was built. It's actually 100 50 years old. This year was built in 18 69 and it was by Mr Wentworth and we have a zinfandel named after him. Um, and it was the post office and the general store, So this was the center of the hub for Alexander Valleys. If you're coming over the mountain from Calistoga from the hot springs or heading up north, you would come through here. So you had to come get your mail by horse and order your sugar and flour back in the days. That was the place to do it. And you kept a lot. I mean, is that the original kind of some of the original building? Most of it is the original building. So where the main tasting room is in a lot of our storage space, our event spaces all original. That was where the General store was. So the original brickwork, the flagstone on the outside of the building actually came. There was a school here around 1900 that they believe fell down in the earthquake of 19067 disco earthquake. And they put that back on the outside of the building in the in the 20 years I believe so. There is a good amount of the water. Tower is original and the home out front was Mr Wentworth's home that we're actually remodeling now, that's so cool. Yes, I biked by and look. And then when I found out it was a winery because I didn't know it always, you know your wound by right, And I'm like, Oh, I've got to go there! And I wasn't even a big wine drinker the time, But I just knew I had to go in and check it out, even just to see it and came in, tried the wines, love the wines. And so just excited, super excited or happy to meet with me today. So I was all like a, um, absolutely. And our history goes back in. The first bonded winery on this site was back in 18 80. So the history of this winery goes back. Pre prohibition. There's been several wineries throughout the years and can indict Diane Wilson. Our owners bought it the building in 2000. It was pretty dilapidated at the time. It took him 10 years to bring it to what it is now and open up a za wineries we've been awaiting for just under 10 years share a little bit more because I'm just going on about the architecture. It's, I think it's super cool. But yeah, a little bit more about all of that or anything, you want to kind of share that direction. We er yes, so we focus on the Bordeaux's. We are out here in the Alexander Valley, so it's known to be cabernet country and the Bordeaux varietals, which grow well because it is very warm out here in Alexander Valley. The Cabinet is okay in the heat in all of its varietals. The soil's out here, also being very rich from the Russian River. Just being behind our property had moved through this. It's moved quite many times, so this valley has got really rich soil. And behind us, the courtyard of our winery faces the volcanic mountains, and so we've got two volcanoes in the area. We still consider them active, and you can see the red soils in the morning the way the sunshine hits it. And so that also tends into the cabinet can just really well with those soils and brings in some of those flavors into the grapes. Nice. Okay, and that's what we're here to talk about today is Bordeaux varietals. And so here's what I know Bordeaux is a region in France, and varietals is a type of great. So we're talking about if I'm getting this correct and correct me if I'm wrong, Of course. That's why we're here. Is I'm assuming grapes that originally from the Bordeaux region, there now here and we're growing him there. And I've heard the term many, many times. So yes, so you're on the right track. Okay. Bordeaux is a region of France and some would say, the most famous region of France. And there are only five varietals that were allowed to be grown in Bordeaux for most of the years. They're opening their mind a little bit more nowadays in the new generation, but they're five bridles that we consider to be the board over rivals. And that would be cabernet sauvignon cabernet Franck, which were drinking merlot, malbec and Petit Britta. Now in France on they're much stricter. And of those five bridles, there is basically two areas to board the left side of the river, the right side of the river on each one of them. Either cabernet is the dominant grape, and you use. The rest is blending grapes or merlot is the dominant grave, the rest as blending grapes. Three. Great thing about here is that our grapes actually ripe in very easily. We have phenomenal weather here. That's why Sonoma and Napa are great areas for wine and were able to do things like the cabernet franc or drinking on its own. They would never be able to do that in France. It wouldn't ripen up. Really? Okay, so that was kind of one of my questions is I had assumed that one of the reasons they were grown here is because it was a very similar climate. But it's actually better, but better. Okay, similar. But better we get a little bit warmer. The great thing about California, most regions of California, will grow grapes is we do not have a problem with ripening them. There's a few off years here and there, but for the most part are fruit ripens very easily. We have that perfect weather, so we get really warm days. We're not that far from the coast. We get the cool breezes of the fog and or the fall again at night will come all the way into Alexander Valley. And so it's that stressing of the grapes between the heat and the cool that they really enjoy and that allows the flavours to develop. One thing I wanted to take a step back to is I'm having to describe what each of the five grapes does as faras when you're blending them together. Because the 2nd 1 we do have with us is a meritage. And what a meritage is is a blend of 2 to 5 of the grapes. It's actually a word that was made up and started in 1985 because the French said you can't use the word Bordeaux anymore on your bottles. So we had to come up with enough because we're not technically from the res. Yes. Okay. Gotta degrading the French wines or something. Yes way. Actually, there was a contest held with three gentlemen, very prominent gentlemen from Napa Valley, and a woman won the contest and she came up with the word Meritage and it is pronounced Meritage not marry Taj. Won't people know that because it was the word merit and heritage put together some way to remember it, okay, And it was kind of to honor those five board over idols and when you use the word meritage, there's something called a merited society that you have to pay him to be a member of, to be able to use the word on the label. And then you adhere to us that our rules and the rules are. You have to use at least two of the five and through the five grapes that we just left it there or up to all five. So 2345 in your blend, and one always has to be dominant. Typically, cabernet is the dominant grape in most Meritage buttons, but you could do something else if you wanted to. So I'd like to talk about what each of the grapes dust. When you get a cabernet, you may not know it. It may not say it on the label, but usually there's something else blended in to your cabernet. I have actually learned that, like, even if it's a cavernous seven year old, um, or whatever it's like usually are not always a pure cab right there. Okay, it's rare to get it to be 100%. It only has to be 75% toe. Label it on the label cabernet sauvignon on Dhe. Nothing else. It's then, at that point, if it's 75% ERM or it's not considered a blend. But that's and that's interesting to me. I would imagine be higher, and I always just assumed that that's what I had. So that's anyway, I'm sorry. Just like to point that out, because that, to me, was very interesting. So you have to see if it's anything less than 75%. You have to call it something else. And this is where we get a lot of made up names, sometimes of lines, because they're blending something. For example, we here have our wild boar blend, and it's a 50 50 cabs inferno blend. So we called it something else. Wild boar after Lord snort out front. Oh yes, the big out there. He'll be on the instagram, all the other places if you want to see him, and and so we have to, you know, come up with another name. But otherwise, if it's 75 arm or of the particular varietal, you could call it that varietal. So cabernet sauvignon. Let's talk about being a main wine that people are familiar with, so a lot of times you'll have 5% merlot. 5% mall back when we have to 85%. So 10% petite Bordeaux. And, you know, whatever the rest is with cab Franck. So, um, cabernet sauvignon on its own is it is a bridal that does his really good on its own house those deep sharing flavors. But if you want to add if you have a year, that's maybe, you know, a bit cooler it might have a bit more pepper or a green bell pepper flavor to it. So we'll say we add in some merlot what merlot does. Marlow is softer, merlot doesn't tend to have tannins, and it comes more in on the nose of a violet spectrum. So it smells like, oh, like violets. Oh, and it has a softer flavor to it. So when you start with your cab, maybe you want to soften it up. So you're gonna add a little bit more S O. And I'm sorry because I'm trying to keep up with you. Here s o the cab, is it? I think we I've kind of learned anyway, maybe not a room, but it's a bit stronger flavor you're saying is, and so by bringing in them or low, you're kind of softening that, bringing it down a little bit, is that correct? So it's not as bold of a flavour, so it's, it's It can calm the tannins down as well. The drawing that health Because merlot doesn't do that, that makes calm that down. No cabernet franc, which were tasting cabernet franc, is what I call this spice rack of the blending grapes it is being it being the parent of cabernet sauvignon. It brings on pepper and always brings in the pepper spice. So when it's unripened, it's on the green bell pepper spectrum, and as it ripens, it gets to be black pepper and then white pepper. So it was always a hint of pepper and spice that comes through with cabernet franc, so you add a little bit of that in if you need to have a little bit of spice. If I wanted it to have more of a bell pepper, I might pick it up earlier. I wanted have a bit more of a white pepper. I might pickle later, yes, and the green bell pepper flavor that also comes to an under ripen cabernet that actually comes from something. If you want to get really talking to go called Piriz scenes, Okay, so it's the piers, scenes that don't ripen out. And that's where the green bell pepper flavor comes from. Okay, some people love it. Yeah, yeah, but that's okay. And that's what I did not know. That I knew it was a more peppery I didn't know how or why, and that's very interesting to know. So okay, I'm sorry. Carry on, then. I s Oh, so your animal malbec is It's a It's a bigger grape and it also has a little bit of a darker color. So mall that can be added for color. And then Mom Beck is on the blueberry spectrum. It just smells 100%. Mom back seems like a bull of blueberries, so again softer. Sometimes it can have a little bit of a tannic structure to it, but it's just adding it a softness in a little bit of color in a different way. Then say merlot is on, and then petite Bordeaux, which we also have some petit verdot in front of us. The petit for dough is what I say adds color and structure. It's very, very dark, inky in color, much like a petite sera that, you know. It has an very, very tannic and bolts. So when I talk about the tans, that's that drying effect in your mouth. And so it adds structures. So if you have, it may be accommodated a little bit softer that year. You can add some petite Bordeaux, and that's going to allow it to age for a longer potential, because it's got that structure to it. Interesting. And I'm looking at this now, and it is definitely darker 100%. And then you said, It's It's yeah Oh, definitely in the town of your witch. Dry out the mouth there so you definitely get that People who don't know what tannins are. It's that same thing. You're going to get in coffee or tea when you drink coffee or tea. That drawing effect that you got your palate. It's the same exact thing comes from the skins from the skins. Yeah, and and and you can totally if you've tasted a wine it likes it almost like, sucks the moisture out of your mouth, right? That's and That's the tannins. Yes, that's the tannins. Okay? And this definitely is stronger in that. So maybe I'm maybe I'm learning. Maybe not here. So I've got my using my cab of some sort. Or actually probably start with my cab cabernet sauvignon saying that seven year old I was carrying something. Yeah, okay. I always feel like I'm, like, mispronouncing it because I mispronounced most things. But that aside, it's like uncommon word, I think for me. So you start with that. If I wanted a little spicier, I might throw in a little bit of the cab. Franck, if I want to mellow it out a little bit, that's why I bring in my merlot. Yes. And if I want to strengthen a little bit, add a little bit of that. That tannin and dryness that I would bring in some of my petite Bordeaux and potentially Mel back to. I said, I think malbec is a little more structure as well. It's a mile back on. Your palate is gonna be heavier than the merlot. Merlot really is. The softness and malbec is brings in almost want to say the prettiness, prettiness. I like that. And you know, and that's what's funny. I think that I've learned about wine is you could use a word like prettiness, and it's like legit, you know, for certain wines, you know, it's like for I mean, you wouldn't use that with almost anything else, I think. But when you say that about a wine, we do call line pretty and beautiful and our winemaker license a seductive a lot. Yes. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Again, oddly enough, words you can use with wine that I don't think you could use with many other beverages are indoor foods, right? No, no. Me to movement here. Yeah, Ugo, you're not with wine. So the malbec, I think. Did we cover that very much or Yeah. You know what's interesting about Malbec? We do a single varietal bottled mall. Becca's well, and it sells out very, very quickly. What's interesting about Malbec is that malbec kind of has come forward because of the Argentinian malbec. But it's very different than what is grown here in California. What is grown in France. You would never see it on its own in France, but it likes that it's here. It ripens so well. It smells like a bowl of blueberries. And it has that sort of blueberry quality on your palate. That's right. You mentioned a drink. It goes with a lot of different things. You can do heavy food. You can just have it on its own. It's just something really fun. Let's have brought in to bring it. May be a little sweet, a little fruity or then kind of potentially if you're gonna be okay. Nice. And now that said, we've got the cab franc and the petite Bordeaux in their own bottles and bottle on their own, and you're saying that's unusual? Unusual, Yeah, and and something. I think I'm seeing more more cab Franck, I think these days, but I think you're right. It's almost all coming out of, like, at least Northern California, maybe even cinema value, maybe even narrower than that. Do you think or yes, well, most mostly Catholic. That's grown, I would say, is in Dry Creek and Alexander Valley. So the northern part of Cinema County, because it's warmer, appears so those bottles do like it to be warmer. Uh, cap Frank is getting a little bit more attention because it's basically the number one grape in Virginia. Virginia is now the number five region for wine in the country. Virginia's in the statement. State of Virginia. Wow. Okay, I would not have thought of them as a wine growing region. It is okay. It's tied with Texas right now for number five in the country. So why not said Texas either? So that's awesome. Cabernet franc is something I've always thought that it's actually one of the reasons I work here said Iraq was because they do several cabernet from's on their own. They're hard to find it. Doesn't you know the fruit is small. It looks like cabernets that buries a really tiny concentrated flavors. If it's not ripened well, it tastes like green public, for which a lot of people don't like. So it has its challenges. But for those of us that, like cabernet Franck like ideo, you seek it out on. We do several of them here, and that's what makes us for unique is the single bridles cabernet franc, the malbec, the petit Bordeaux. Very few people do petite photo on its own as its own bottled varietal. I don't think I I can't say I've ever, but I don't remember ever kind of really seen that. So it is definitely something to do that unique. And it's because of is it the way they're grown or the location, whatever they're able to stand on their own? Or you guys were just brave enough. Our winemaker, Anton Phenomenal Wayne Maker and I think it's something that he enjoys doing as well. But it's part of it is the fact that the fruit we get is phenomenal. This particular vineyard, the runway vineyard, is on the eastern side of Dry Creek, so it's kind of between Alexander Valley and Dry Creek, and it's just it's a perfect area for for growing and letting them ripen and developing those flavors. And that's what we're drinking right now is the pretty bird. Oh, and it is. It definitely stands on its own, I think, 100%. And so then there's the merit Meritage. It's a made up word. It's actually recognized. The Meritage societies actually recognize number 300 countries now, okay? And this society, I believe, has over 6000 members. Now you pay in every year to use the word on the bottle. Otherwise you have to come up with some clever name. Uh, and then you adhere to those rules. And so again, Meritage is something that people will seek out on. The Meritage is on again just to reiterate, it's not a grape, because I think I'd seen it before. I hadn't paid a lot of attention, I think I just assumed it was a grape of some sort. But it's actually a blend of these Burdeau varietals. Correct. Nice. We can't call it a Bordeaux blends because we're in agreement that we wouldn't use that word on the bottle anymore. So we came up with the word Meritage. And so this particular Meritage, we've got four of the five Bordeaux varietals blended in its 82% cabernet. And then we've got 10% merlot, 5% malbec and 3% petite Bordeaux. Okay. And which cabernet? I'm assuming that seven young for this one is cabernet sauvignon. Okay, so there's no Franck in this one. No, Franck in this one, Okay? And that's good. And I can That's a very interesting actually, that's something that recommend I don't know if you guys do this here. I'm assuming maybe you do. But in the tastings you taste the cab. We just like we did the cab franc in the petite Bordeaux and now tasting the Meritage and especially having talked about this, I can taste exactly what you're saying about how you know it's It's actually not super spicy or even there's not a lot of spice anyway, So I'm assuming that's why there's no Franck in there. And then how this other things are kind of balancing it out and balancing that flavour? Absolutely. And it is, you know, actually, today the only when we didn't grab that I still do have opens the Merlot, so we should have, and then we would have had three of the five or idols. But on a regular basis, we usually do. You have one of you know, our alternative because the meritage again, we're calling in a meritage. We're paying homage to that, but it really is a cavity with the blinds. Now, how much covered it was that 82%. So technically you could call that a cab. Yes, OK, interesting. But I like that you don't because I think that's a bit truer to your intent with the wine, I think is that would that be the right word? Our winemaker tends to make our cabernets to be 95% 94 95% cabernet, so he really truly sticks to them being almost all cabernet blends in a tiny bit of potato or cop drunker, depending on what the year is calling for. I don't see him doing a lot of blending of the other Bordeaux varietals. And so I think that's why we're paying homage to the Meritage with this one with doing four of the five bridles, innit? Yeah, that's the intent. It's It's a blend of sorts because you're finishing almost, if you will. The cab, as opposed to just saying, Hey, this is our cab But it's been slightly tweet, if you will. Yes, he likes to keep our cab's pretty pure to being cabernets because we grow the cabernets. We do several cabernets, and they're all from specific vineyards and specific regions. And he likes to stay really true to those vineyards and the flavors that come out of those. So it shows our spectrum being that were known in the Wilson family as the Bordeaux house. We have a really nice spectrum of cabernets that come from different places over Dry Creek and Alexander Valley. And then we have the single varietals of the cat drunken bro. So this is definitely our our homage to a blend. And so Burdeau is a region correct or does the region and yes, typically in France and some places outside, but typically in France. In Italy, they do tend to name wines by region. Where we do, we show the region on there. But we tended show things by. They were by the Rydell, but more by the grapes. So on that for me is always, I think, and that this kind of helps because I heard Burdeau and I always assumed it could be, and I guess, technically can be any great by the Britto region. But really, if we're talking about maybe true Bordeaux varietals, that is one of those five, there's well there until just recently were only allowed to grow their own under five. Well, those five and there were rules about how you could blend them. Now they're opening their minds a little bit more. But it was only those five bridles out of Bordeaux, and they're they're primarily blended. It sounds like to it. So you're saying like one side, it's primarily blended on the cab's. The other side's primarily blended on the merlot, so that's kind of the base, and you go from there. So that kind of makes sense. I haven't delved much into those because I don't It's a Bordeaux wine, so I don't know what I'm getting right. It's like is what's it gonna be, right? I don't know. It's from the region, but it could be any grape anything. But that helps because that helps me. No. Okay, so if it's coming from there, it's probably there. I could actually probably look on the label and then will they? Will they list the percentage it? Actually, I don't I don't necessarily, uh you need to look more at where it's coming from. Left banker, right bank and those of the differences in whether it's more merlot based or cab based is the town. So you have to know a little bit more about their regions. I think that's also a difference that we d'oh you know, looking at the Meritage bottle so within Sonoma County and we have 17 or 18 a V A's now. So what we consider regions are a V A's or American viticultural areas. We're in Alexander Valley. It is an A v a. It is specific, and the biggest thing that we look out for a Navy A is there's about seven factors that go into it. But the most important is the weather and soil different than an area right next to it, say Dry Creek, which is on the other side of one on one. So we're saying they're specifically different. And so we label by Eva if those grapes air coming specifically again, there's percentage rules about that from that aviator. So all of these grapes for the Meritage came from Alexander Valley because it says it on the bottle. So and earlier we were talking about Russian River and being known for Pino. There's that's another way that we look at it different than no plumbing. It just says Bordeaux. And then you have to know about the specific town and what the rules are for that town within Bordeaux of how they went. Yeah, got it. Okay, so and so that helped. That gives me a lot of insight into Burdeau brought over here right and started growing them here. And then you guys opted to kind of like more specialized in those Bordeaux varietals. Yes, okay. And then and I'm pulling it all together here. I'm trying to make sense out of this. And then definitely I can see on the labels here. You've got the dry creek, the Sonoma and Alexander. And that's one thing I found very interesting is, I guess the borderline, as you just said, is the highway 101 which kind of goes north and south right up. California. There you're going to get a very different I mean, I guess maybe if you're not right on one side of the highway or the other, but as a whole, two very different kind of you could just on one side of the highway or the other really again. That has to do with the Russian. Her Russian river runs through the middle of the Alexander Valley. It has moved directions over the years with earthquakes or an earthquake country. And the 1906 earthquake is what caused. Actually, cha killed a shift, and and that's right next to us as well. And that's a known region for chardonnay and cabernet is Chalk Hill. You'll see that on labels. A lot of people like talk ill. That's another one I've seen most of it for. Alexander Valley is that we're up against the hills were up against, you know, the hills that sort of block into Lake County. In the Napa County heat, we don't see the fog as much. Over here stays much warmer, which is why the Bordeaux varietals grow so well. In this area versus dry creek, you can see the fog a little bit more. It's just that much closer to the coast and you condone. You can definitely see the fog creep in and or the coastal winds. We have a vineyard from Dry Creek that we make our merlot from. That is really high up, and so it could be above the fog below the fog, but gets those coastal breezes and could cool down. We don't see the fog in Alexander Valley in their summer time, as much as they might see it over there, so that's weather. And that's what's crazy, too. And I think the because the placement of where they are in the valley here is the whole. It's like who gets the sun win in the day and everything else. So you've got again, literally like a freeway drawing a line almost. And you can have completely different wines on either side. So and you guys, So they're primarily excel in Alexander Valley is what you guys were doing primarily. Yeah, and growing here because that's where those bird does. I do not just as good, but better. And then bird. Oh, yes. Okay. I think I actually kind of understand Bordeaux varietals and how the how they're blended. That was awesome. To how they all kind of worked together and how they complement each other. You mentioned real quick, actually, one time about this a bit about stressing the grape, I think he said the heat here can kind of do that a little bit. What is that? Do our adder change? Here's my best technology for a great fine. I liken it. Thio, if we were to put it a month pregnant woman in the middle of the desert. Uh right. So this is what the great fighters go through on a daily basis when we start the day here. You know, in the morning I could come in here could be 55 degrees or so on a summertime morning heats up pretty quickly, and we could get up to 105. That day. We'll drop back down to 55 or 60 at night. It's a 50 degree Grady in the temperature in a daily on a daily basis and what that does to the grapevine. So coming back to my pregnant women a month in the desert, if she was out in the desert without water, her body is going to go into protection mode of that baby, and all nutrients and water stored are going to go. That's what the grapes do every single day. So the great finds the very smart. They're very, very interesting, how smart they are, eh? So what they do in the heat of the day, they think that's the end of the world, and they stress up and they release their nutrients in their water into their grapes and protect them and keep them from burning and and starting, raising them. That's their seeds. That's their next generation kind of thing, right? So they're putting everything in the evening when the when the coastal breeze comes in. And when it cools down a little bit, they kind of relax. Oh, okay, that wasn't the end of the world. And the moisture that we do get in if we do get the fog, there was a tiny bit of monster, and they will take that in. And then the next day they go through that Okay, Time to stress out again. And that's the difference. That that's what causes the flavors to be really good is that sort of up and down daily temperature. Grady and 40 to 50 degrees swing on a daily basis, which you don't get that anywhere else in the world on because we're tied to the San Francisco Bay and the Ocean so closely. That's what happens. It's a unique hair. Got it? Yes, So it sze pushing everything into the great cause. It's like, got a protected gotta get the so and that's just enhancing the flavour, making it stronger, making it better. Better, I guess, more flavorful. Ah, little more water in there, which actually, although in some cases you want a little less than their I guess opinion on what you're trying to do. But then that's where you're also saying to is that be smart with water. So you get the smaller, tighter grapes. Right? Which again? They're concentrated flavors. Liturgies. Yes. Okay, good. Awesome. Amazing. Okay, I have actually learned a lot here. Okay. Thank you. Anything else? You kind of want to share a CZ faras Bordeaux varietals, Anything we didn't cover? I think we've covered it pretty well. Accent. I would agree how if somebody wanted to and I highly recommend Check out. So the rock. How might they do that? Uh, well, you can just stop in any day. We're open. 11 5 There's very few days were closed, so I call it the taste of Come to the taste room and check it out. We're always rotating the wines that we have on the tasting menu. And usually we have some surprises open as well. You can email me. I'm Laura, soda rock winery dot com. If you would like to do something a little more educational, we do to do seated tastings. We can also do a local cheese pairing with that. And I think that the cheese is really enhanced The flavors of the wine since they are big, bold red wines, and they kind of need food to go along with them. It really changes the flavors. Or if there's anything else special you want to do, just let us know and way do wedding. Sir, we do. We've done wedding proposals. You can come bring a picnic and enjoy our front patio. It's a great place to visit. It actually really isn't again super unique architecture. That that's what caught my eye and brought me in here the first time on DSO website. You guys a winery and dot com. We can ship pretty much anywhere. We've got a lot of great events coming up in the month of October and November. They're updated on our website, and if you can think about next summer, we do a summer music Serious. We do a concert each month in the evenings, which is really fun. Bring a picnic, grab some wine that we have on great specials and hang out. Listen to music at the winery. Awesome. That's a good day right there. All right, well, so until next time, if you guys have any questions, thoughts, feedback, ideas for topics, you can reach out to us at the end sophisticated palate dot com Tell your friends raid us all the other good stuff so other people confined us until next time.

A podcast about all things wine, beer and spirits. Join us each week as we drink and delve into different alcohol related topics. I'm Mark. I'm Lauren, and I'm Matt. Cheers. Cheers. Salud. That is very good. Thank you very much easier. Thank you. Very. Thank you. And we're just episode over. No. Fortunately, this is gonna go good. Good. I like that. Um, I'm super excited to be here because, uh, we're talking about Mead for anyone. Hasn't read the I don't episode title. And, uh, I kind of came into this one a little bit different. We're just talking about that. I came in this one little bit blind. What I know about meat kind of has this to me like that. Very romantic. Whatever. It's like the Middle Ages. Yeah. Drink my meat and whatever and right. And you don't hear about it much today. I don't think least I don't. But it's something that I've always wondered about and had a lot of interest in. So when you guys said you guys were willing to talk about meat, I got super excited. We're glad you're here, so we should say who we are. So where I had Bloom and Mead works? Yep. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Lauren. Want to tell us a little bit about you and as your alcoholic history alcoholic, Your relationship making a lot of assumptions? Yes. Um, yeah. So I'm Lauren. Matt and I are partners here at the military were also married. Um, so we open this together a little over a year ago. My relationship to alcohol. I think alcohol was fairly casual in my family. Growing up, I'm an only child. Um, I think my parents probably felt as though if I was exposed to it at home, it wouldn't be a big deal when I left home. So, you know, we would often have wine with dinner beer with dinner, things like that. And I think there's theory kind of held true. It never felt like a really big deal. My I think relationship toward alcohol now is really kind of shaped by food. And I think of it as kind of a food, something that I would add to a meal, something that I drink because I really love the flavor of it. Much as I would approach food and so it's kind of it's kind of morphed in that way, and then taking on this business is really kind of an extension of that and my interest in food. Yeah, and I think that's really wise what your parents did. And I did that with my kids. They were growing up. And I think that that's and we've had episodes that we've talked about that before. Just people relationship without cause They grow up. And I think if you do remove that mystery on that and no, um, danger, whatever rock. All right, then it's like who? I'm gonna go experiment with some normal Not really a big deal. It's not as cool when your parents were doing Yeah, that's the key. Oh, maybe I should start doing a lot more things. I don't want my kids to. D'oh! Look a little weird, both leaves. Yeah, no, I would not be, although if it kept them from doing it on. So, Matt, why don't you tell us a little bit about yours? So my really ship with alcohol? My family was very open with alcohol of growing up. So I remember when I first had my first drink, Green like that, but definitely around. Maybe the age of 12 is when we started in. My parents are are very flavor or in a people, so they're always exposing me to new wines. My dad's a whiskey drinker. So, like, you know, there's always a new whiskies to be trying in the household and stuff, and, uh, and growing up from there, I eventually went to college, and it was in college where I got exposed to craft beer as a consumer. So I quickly, you know, evolved from Keystone Light to craft beer in college for my 21st birthday. We had actually, at a CAG ago, I was a local berry in Boulder, but it was one of their Belgian style beers for my birthday like that. We had 1/4 barrel, and it was a lot to finish higher alcohol than what most kids in college or you working. But you took on that challenge we did way. It was fun. Uh, and then after college, uh, moved to Chicago and you know, the crappy er seen? Was it the same in Chicago's? It wasn't in Colorado, so I definitely got tow watch kind of the craft beer seem kind of come through Chicago a little bit, which is a lot of fun and then eventually started a brewery in Chicago. So I transitioned from consumer to producer and and with some some business partners. And that was a big change for me because I was just went from enjoyment, actually analyzing, and even as a number, I didn't really analyze too much of what I was doing. I was just enjoying it and s. So now when I consume alcohol like I find myself, I have to turn a switch on or turn a switch off to either say, like, I'm just here to enjoy this and and not think about what I'm drinking and just be in the moment or I need actually analyze it and I have to turn on that switch to say, like, Okay, what am I drinking? Why, like what is it? What am I tasting? What am I getting out of it and go through this whole process of I'm doing it? And I intentionally did that because I early on in the craft beer scene, when I was learning, like meeting people and doing stuff I saw so many people that, like stop. It looked to me like they weren't enjoying it anymore because they were over analyzing. And they were thinking so much about it that they kind of lost the fun. And I was like, I don't wanna be that guy s So I made it a point. T build a switch and turn it off and just hang out and drink. It was like a well, while I can't drink beer anymore because I have a gluten allergy. You know, I still can appreciate, like, just hanging out and have, like, the concept of paying. I'm just having a beer, not analyzing it. Yeah, I never really thought about that, actually, until you were just talking about that. That how actually producing it can completely change your enjoyment. I've known a person or two. Nobody famous. Unfortunately, I and the movie business of where and when you do that, it changes your perspective. You can't watch a movie normal. So it picking every piece of it. Yeah. Yeah. You're overthinking over analyzing it, so that's smart. You have the ability to flip that switch, are you? Can you flip the switch? Yeah. Okay. Good. And that's That's good to know that you guys could do that because I never even really thought about that. It could, like you said, Ruin it for some people. Another thing that I think is kind of interesting is we found that the more access you have to it, I think the less we consume in volume. So you know, we'll pick out something that we're really interested in really looking forward Thio and have a drink or two. But when you're around it all the time, you're tasting it all the time. We don't really drink that often because it's just a part of every single day. I wish that work. I was younger. I worked in a cookie company on I wish it worked that way. No. Every time a fresh batch came out of the oven, I was eating another well, enjoy. Yeah, yeah, it's good. Let's see. Let's start with Let's just talk about meat because let's just say what it is, what here's what little I know. I mean, you can fix and or correct. This is it's an alcoholic beverage made with honey. That's about how much I know. Okay, so is that semi accurate that is accurate to kind of narrow it a little bit further. Meat is technically a honey wine, so it's defined by the federal government as a wine. We have a small winemakers license to produce meat, insider, honey, yeast and water. That's what goes into a fermentation for Mead. And then from there you're obviously adding in ad junks, other flavors, things like that meat is interesting and that there's different language that has evolved to describe Meet with different things added to it. So we have a size or on the menu. That means that it's Mead and pressed apple juice fermented together. And I'm gonna try some of that in a little bit. Yeah, we have been on the flight. Um, you know, there's there's words like, uh, mellow Mel, which means there's a fruit added to it, or a pie mint, which means there's grapes. We rarely use those names for things that we feel like most people don't know them. It makes it a little bit less approachable for somebody to understand what they're about to drink when it's something that they might not be familiar with in the first place. But it does have meat has this very long history, and so there's kind of a language that's evolved around it. Yeah, over time. A lot of you know, a lot of historians believe that, you know, meat is the oldest alcoholic beverage in the world that I'm I believe that I think that's probably accurate from a production standpoint. It makes a lot of sense that, like all you really got to do is mix water with honey and you bring the sugar content down. The sugars are readily available for used to eat them, and we have used readily available in the ambient air and around us and stuff. So I think that, you know, it's probably the oldest beverage in the alcoholic beverage in the world. Yeah, and that makes I mean, that makes sense, right? Because beer and some of those other things and wine, they you have to have the grapes and CEO grains and more things. This is you know, honey, you put a little water in there, let the yeast in the air do its thing, and eventually you've got something like this. So it makes sense that would be first, and that is really and that's kind of, you know, it is surprising to me that it is literally It's the base anyway, man again, you can add 500 a jillion things. But honey, east and water, that's it. Okay. And so now you called this wine and I'm drinking. Now, you know, the one I'm drinking is ah, hop would say, Tell me what mean hopped meat. So it's gonna taste a little more beer, like I'm assuming just because of the hops. And it does taste beer like, but so it's somewhere between, and this one particular somewhere between a beer and maybe like a sparkling wine ish is. So how would you explain that flavor? The taste cause I've also heard it, I've heard it referred to is like a beer like drink. I've heard it referred to as a wine, and and I've never really understood if there were two different things are just too different representations of the same. So we struggled with that a little bit in terms of the the way it's defined by the government. It's Matt. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's defined as wine because of, um, the amount of manipulation that's done to the ingredients before fermentation. So if you're thinking about a wine you're taking honey, mixing it with water, beginning fermentation, you're taking grapes. You're pressing them. You're beginning fermentation, whereas with beer you're taking grain. You're boiling them first, and then you're beginning your fermentation. So that wine designation really just has to do with the fact that we're taking an agricultural product and moving directly into fermentation. Okay, we've feel that sometimes saying wine doesn't give people the right image or the right feel of what we produce. Traditional meat is usually more wine like so it's gonna be higher and alcohol. It's gonna be fairly sweet, almost like a dessert wine. It's gonna be still a lot of times it's served at room temperature. Um, so it kind of fits more of that wine description. We make session style mead, so they're 5 to 7% alcohol there carbonated. Most of them are quite dry. There's not a lot of sweetness left to them. And so when we were calling it honey wine, we felt like saying that just didn't convey what the product was. So we started as we were describing to people before we opened, calling it meet Insider Brewery, which isn't even really accurate. But it helped people get an idea of what it was like. It's sparkling. It's refreshing. You can drink a pint of it. Um, and it also gave them. I feel for what the space would be like. It's a tap room or than, ah, winery tasting room. You know, you can sit and play games, hang out, watch movies. What? Not So, yeah, that was a struggle for a little while to try to figure out what to call it. Now, a lot of times they were describing it to People will say it's it's kind of fermented like a dry cider that gives people an idea of kind of what the fermentation process is like loosely. Um, it gives them a little bit of an idea of what to expect when they start to drink it out of the glass. It's gonna be cold. It's gonna be sparkling, could be dry. Yeah, because if you'd said honey wine, Yeah, I not sure whatever malady. Yeah, and if he said meet again, I'm not Harbor center on there and again. I'm kind of Torrance. Somewhere between is this a sparkling wine or this again more towards ah cider or a beer type of a beverage. So it kind of walks that that line very nicely, I guess. Yeah, such this session style exemplifies that a little bit more just cause, you know, I described it something you couldn't get a barbecue, and that's that's kind of my target. When I think about anything that I'm making, like, Can I drink this set of barbecue? And, you know, in the sun in the summer, time like our is like where his traditional need, like as much as I may love traditional need. I can't drink it at a barbecue in the summer time. It's just a tooth too heavy, too thick to high alcohol. Like I'm It's not gonna work for me. And it's a really. Oftentimes they're really saturated flavor, which is great, you know, really beautiful, thick, heavy flavor on your palate, which we love. But you would want to drink that in smaller quantities, and that that would be like you're straight more traditional. I mean, okay, you know, we're talking before about how it's likely that it was the first fermented beverage. You know, a lot of times when people come in, they've either never heard of mean and they randomly stumble across us or they like the space or their friend brings them in. And then we're starting from square one explaining what meat is, which is a fun conversation for us to have. Or a lot of times it's like, Oh, well, my friends uncle made some in his basement, and that was the 1st 1 that I had, and I really didn't like it. So I don't think I like meat. Not that there isn't a great home brewed meat out there, but because there aren't a lot of barriers to entry, a lot of people kind of try it. You know, maybe they're kind of learning about home brewing about fermentation. And so a lot of people have a mediocre first experience with me, you can imagine. Yeah, definitely. Okay, so I had the hop meat, and now I'm drinking the rhubarb need. So let's talk a little bit about each of those just real quick. So the hop that is, I guess, it. As it says. It's a meet with hop, so it does have a bit more of that beer type profile a little more like a pale ale type profile. Oh, there you go. Yes. Okay, but with no bitterness. Um, doing and talk a little bit of the process and why that's true. When I'm adding the hops to the hop to meet, I'm doing it all post fermentation. So in the way I make meat, I'm not. I'm not heating it like I don't have a boil process So I don't really have, like, the traditional liken beer where you get the cops are going to make bitterness and all that stuff for whirlpool editions anything like that. But I do add hops, post fermentation. And when I do that, they it's harder to get the flavor. It's easy to get a lot more of the aromatics. So by making it two additions the first edition, I actually mix the hops with hot water to simulate the world pool process in the beer world. And then the second edition I do just as dry hops on dhe. Keep it, keep it as a cold, cold addition, and that gives me a lot more aromatic. The first visit me a lot more flavor kind of rounded out a little bit more like a pale ale, but without the bitterness. OK, nice, nice. And and so I guess to hit that real quick and then we'll talk maybe little bit about the rhubarb one. So I guess to get into kind of how it's made. So you're saying you don't like I know a lot of these. I guess you don't heat it up with wine either. But, you know, with the lot of the out calls, you heat everything up and then you cool it down and then and you're just still and everything else. So with this, I guess you'd still need to heat it up to distill it. Or I guess, maybe go through kind of. How would you not that anybody should go out and make some feed. Go grab. You should actually just don't know that it might be, you know? Okay. First batch is maybe OK learning process. I think there's a lot of great homemade meats that sons of you probably shouldn't grab a jar of honey from the store, throw some water in it and expects me to show up. You could expect me. You might not expect good meat looks OK But so what? What's that general process like isas faras. How mighty you make a basic meat so basic process, you know, as we're saying, is mixing honey with water. And then the biggest difference with making need from other alcoholic beverages is during the fermentation. The east really have no nutrients readily available to them. So, like in beer, there's a lot of nitrogen that's readily there. A lot of fruits have nitrogen that's coming into the fermentation, and that that nitrogen is really like the vitamins, if you will, for the yeast to finish fermentation. So I have a lot of food, but they don't have necessarily all the things that they need to finish fermentation. So it's like if we try to survive on Twinkies alive, we'd be alive, wouldn't be in a good place. It would be we would not be happy and healthy, and you really want happy, healthy East when you're doing a fermentation. For the most part, I'm sure there's a few exceptions to that, but I'm not the way I make stuff too often, but eso you really want to make sure you're getting a lot of nutrient in there, and there are different nutrients that are available out there toe making meat. And we we used, we utilize Those were making our means. Okay? The other thing is that when we're mixing the batch in the tank were adding the honey in the hot water, and Matt's trying to add the hot water at the lowest temperature. Possible to get that honey into solution because we don't want to be losing those aromatics and other compounds in the honey which you start to lose over 1 18 Yeah, right in that area. Over 90 degrees for a night. Um, so we're actually trying to keep it on the cooler side to preserve the qualities of the honey. I got it. Now I gotta ask this, too. And although we might have gotten a little glimpse into the reason why on something Matt was saying a minute ago, But why? Why meet? You guys are saying we're gonna put something together, right and again. Meat is unique and awesome, and I think I'm be drinking more. Um, because I like this. This is awesome. But what kind of made you decide that meat is the way to go? So we were both in two very different fields. I was working in the education nonprofit sector. Matt was working in finance technology. He decided to take a leap with two friends who then became business partners and open a brewery. He was there for four or five years as head brewer before he found out that he had a gluten allergy so he couldn't drink beer anymore. Um stayed on for another year or so brewing. And then we realized we needed something else. I need to do something else. It's hard to brew when you can't drink the pottery. Oh, bummer for a verb, brah. I've been working in the Education on profit sector, and I had transitioned into local food sourcing local food advocacy, connecting farmers with, you know, just the broader community and chefs and whatnot. And so when we're moving to Michigan, we were trying to think of ways to combine those two and what the intersection might be. So Matt really wanted to stay in fermentation, ideally something he could drink. Um, and I wanted to be moving my career into something where we were working with local ingredients, local sourcing, and we've made a few batches of Mead before home brewed Mead. Um, we did a sparkling plum, semi dry match years before and have done a couple other batches that we liked, how they turned out. So we started playing with it more. And, you know, we've had a handful of needs and we really were kind of drawn to this session style, and we couldn't find a lot of it. We had Ah, was it a honey lavender need her out of the West Coast under, like, this is this is really drinkable, Portland. So we're like, Why? Why isn't there more of this? Why can't we make this and meet insider kind of lend themselves well, naturally, Because honey and apples, we have in abundance in Michigan, so we could source them from local growers. And we decided to just kind of double down on that and commit completely so all of the ingredients that we use are are from Michigan growers and producers. That's awesome. That's awesome. I know you've mentioned a couple times session style, so that's what we're drinking here. Define session style, So we kind of borrowed the term from the craft beer world s o session style. Tow us is meeting how you know one alcohol content, but you think about like a session. I p a is compared to a regular I p a. OK, ok, eso alcohol content is big to us. So traditional needs being, you know, 12 to 18% alcohol. Let's say ours come in more like that, you know, 4 to 6 or 5 to 7% alcohol right in that range. So first, that's like the first piece of its second piece Tow us is how it finishes on the palate. So, you know, can I drink more than one of these? Can I hang out drinking in a drinking session on which is kind of the backup? That's kind of the idea. In beer of a session I p a. Something that you could sit and drink, you know, a couple of instead of one. And then, you know, being a little act. Yeah, I know. It's ah, it's how it finishes on the palate. And is it a refreshing product is something I can hang out in half. Awesome. Awesome. Is there any now? We've talked about meat and we know what meat is. I'm by the way, I'm drinking the Sizer right now because I've got this nice little tasting fighting together for me, and I'm working my way through and this is good. So the sizer is the blend of meat and cider, and and that's like That's really good cause it's It's I like ciders. I'll actually really enjoy it. Really enjoy ciders that another to something A little extra to that one. It's I don't know how I would describe it. Yeah, it's really light. There's a little bit more of a floral note behind it. We sometimes call that like the gateway drug into Mead, because people now are more familiar. Recite er, usually not familiar with me. And so if they've had cider before, um, that's kind of a good transition into session. Style means, at least, um, it's, you know, it's semi drives. Just off dry has a tiny bit of sweetness to it. Apple flavor is familiar to people. Also, because it's fruity, we kind of perceive it as being sweeter than it is, so it's not actually that's sweet, but because there is that Apple note, that kind of tricks are palate and the thinking that it's a little bit sweeter You know, in America we tend to like sweet things so that I'm very guilty. Yeah, a little bit of perceived sweetness. Yeah, and and like I said, most things that would make her quite dry. So that one has It's a little bit more playful in the matter of sweetness. Um, So what I was gonna ask before I get distracted by that amazing Sizer, how would you if you were to be a connoisseur, which I am not by any means unsophisticated by definition here, right? How would you, like, go about, like, tasting or sampling one of these? I mean, because it would you do like to go for the aroma and then the taste, Or I mean, is there anything to it or is it really just one of those? You just pick it up and go to town and drink it. I think you certainly could go through that process. There are a lot of aromatics because of the honey. We do a lot of things to try and preserve those. And then a lot of the things that were adding into it certainly have their aromas. And then I think that the meads tended the flavor of them tends to change a little bit as the temperature changes that were serving them cold on draft. And then I think, as they start thio warm up a little bit, you know, even just a couple degrees. You're kind of getting different notes from the honey from some of the fruit. But that being said, the idea of this drink was for it to be casual. You know, traditional meat is something that you sit and sip. You drink like a port. You know, you're kind of analyzing it. You've got that switch turned on while you're drinking it and to us. Session made. Part of the point of it was to be casual, so you could just, you know, crack it open, enjoy it, you know, enjoy it for what it is. And, ah, so, yes, I think that that process could probably be done on anything. But for us, it's meant to just be somethingto relax, address for me, the the way we make means is indicative of, like, you know, we want craft it. We want to produce a product that you know, delights the customer we want. We want something that has thought put into it. And it has meaning very intentional product. I think you're very intentional is great word, but at the same time, like we're not taking it too seriously. Like, you know, if if someone wants a shotgun, one of our meats like, yeah, you're gonna kick him out. Like, you know, maybe, you know, maybe the federal government, the state government might have issues with people drinking that fast in my facility. But, like, you know, I I don't really care. Like, I hope that they're enjoying their moment, you know, whatever it is, whether that's because of the meter, it's because they're just hanging out, drinking, hanging out with friends and something that can drink while they do that. I think it's meant to be enjoyed. Yeah, yeah, and I have been And that I was just asking, too, because I was trying to do the little, you know, get the nose in there because I know there's a lot of things supposed to do that with and, you know, even beer or whatever. To a degree, I was kind of doing that, but I think I would agree. I mean, these were just enjoyable and I moved on and I'm taking a little bit here a bit there. But now in the black, it's that black current, but current yet okay. And so there's several. Obviously you guys have 10 or 12 I'd have to count here. And that's like too much math from but different flavors that I'm assuming you have some that are more seasonal and or go. And so there's always kind of something I would assume that. I mean, they're depending what you like. Well, it seems we're all Swedish or actually, no, cause the hopped wasn't super sweet, actually. All quite dry. Okay, dry. So but there's a little something on their kind of for everybody. Yeah. So the, um a lot of what we make is is dry. I'd say the sweetest thing that we make sits around medium. So you don't really produce anything on this sweet And, um, yeah, most things air dry, we have four that we produce year round. And then one cider that we produce you around. So the hopped What? You tried the sizer. Would you drive it and thats standard which doesn't have anything else added to it. It's just honey. Houston water, um, semi dry than ah Jin Botanical Mead. So we get Jin botanicals from the local distillery on. They do four different seasonal Jin's. So every season we get there spent botanicals and we, Adam to the Mead post fermentation and let the meat kind of take on some of the flavor from those botanicals. So those we produce your round and then a tart cider. And then everything else is just sees No, depending on what's growing well in Michigan that year. Awesome. I love it. So now we've tried the know these air, our session drinks even enjoyed them this way. If I were is there mixed drinks or is there I mean, other things you could do with these, other than you know, which I'm fine. Pour these e, I'll tell you that. But if I wanted to get a little bit more experimental, shall we say, what else can you can you do with me? We've been making some cocktails here with our regular session means. So they were low and alcohol really refreshing, really light time. But we did one that was a taken a rattler that had the hopped mead grapefruit juice. Um and a little bit of time syrup in there. Um, a couple of things like that. Especially in the summer. They were just really light. Easy drinking. Um, we recently launched a new series of cocktails, so we brewed one high alcohol, but dry mead, Still not carbonated. And we've been using that for meat cocktails. So that one came in at 14% 14% alcohol. Eso it gave it a little bit higher A B V base for making cocktails. So then we're mixing to that, You know, some Citrus. Some simple Serbs that we've made with teas. Um, fruit, herbs. What? Not and mixing them here. And it's to me. It's a really great base. It adds a little bit of a floral. No, but it's not a really hot, dominant flavor. Okay, nice. I'm having a barbecue soon. I wanna have some meat to drink with it. Do you guys sell by the bottle or I mean, I met. You can get it several different ways. Yeah. Yes. So we can a lot of the meats that we make. We can't a couple of our ciders as well, depending what's going on with the season and what not? But then also at the bar here, you know, we fill growlers and hollers as well. Next, I saw a bunch of those up there. You gotta love a good growler. Now question the growlers. So somebody else about this totally minor sidetracked here. But how long do you realistically get out of that growler? Because when I feel a growler, I feel like I got to drink that thing fast. And so, like, I'm like, pounding that thing. But I've heard people say can last a week Thio 7 to 10 ish days. I think even that's a little bit conservative. So we usually tell people want If we cap it, you take it home and put it in your fridge. We usually tell people a week and then once you open it, you know, it's like a two liter. It's gonna start losing carbonation, and it's gonna oxidize a little bit when you when you start opening it more. But really, I think if you take it home, Capt and put it in the fridge, you'd probably get much more than a week out of it. Yeah, I have some. I've talked to some of our regulars and stuff. Who going to take home growlers and stuff that have unfortunately, lost a growler in the fridge? You know, a month later, it was still great, eh? So there's a couple things you meet is in general, more stable than things like beer. Or like some more traditional wines. It's just by the nature of what it is and what how it reacts to different things. It's pretty stable stuff, but it doesn't mean you should, you know, abuse that, like you're gonna lose quality over potential. Definitely potential, lose quality over time. But yeah, it's it's a relatively stable product. It's really once you start opening the growler that it starts to go quickly and keeping it cold is really key. And I mean, like, right for almost any craft product. If you want to preserve it, keep it cold. That's a pretty good rule of thumb. Awesome. Okay, uh, any parting words on me, Anything you want to leave people with or somebody out there who's saying, Hey, I wanna try and give it a go are Maybe they're not sure yet or any anything and all things meet, I think I would just people with the world of meat is a lot wider than, like the initial perception on me. Like I think, you know, just the way we've sat down here and you're trying these meats, like even amongst those me There's a pretty wide range, but like, you know, when you actually look at the whole world of meat And like all the different materials and how it could be dry, it could be sweet to commit carbonated. It could be still like That's, ah, broad spectrum and it's a It's a bigger world. I think that people realize it's gonna But I think one of the one of the joys that we find is when people come in, they've never had it before. They think they don't like it and you Okay, what do you normally like to drink? Let's start there and then see if we can't find something that you enjoy here. You know, we people will say I drink bud light. I drink. You know, I p A's I drink pinot Grigio. I drink, you know, whatever it is, I don't drink anything. And how often you know, probably 90% of the time, 95% of the time those people come in and they tell us what they like to drink and were able to find something that they really love. And especially the fact that usually when people come in, they aren't expecting that. You know, they're kind of kind of set a low bar for what they think is gonna happen. And then they just leave really excited about meat. And that's cool. Yeah, and I would agree my mind. I mean, he's been opened. I thought meat was a drink. Yeah, obviously there's a wide variety and variations upon, and I have enjoyed everything I had today, and so again, it kind of it's taken it from that medieval kind of into something that that's actually very real and very delicious, and that I need more of in my life. I think we can help you. Awesome. On If anybody else out there wants toe toe, learn more. I mean, definitely if you're in the Ann Arbor area, come visit. But if they wanted to ship on doesn't say if they want to find John line and places you can ship, how would they do that on our website, which is drink bloom drink blom dot com. There's a lot of information on their of what's untapped right now, if your local and then we're also connected to 1/3 party wine shipper so we can ship port four packs, too. Probably 30 different states roughly. And if you're in one of those other states, you'll just have to come to Michigan and visit on. It's not a bad place to visit a great place to come visit. I highly recommend Awesome. All right, well, So if you have any feedback, thoughts, comments any of that, you can reach out the sophisticated palates website at the unsophisticated palate dot com, Tell friends neighbors share the word, spread the word, raid us with good stars and good comments and until next time, cheers."

A podcast about all things wine, beer and spirits. Join us each week on our journey as we drink and delve into different alcohol related topics. I'm Mark. I'm Lisa. Cheers. Cheers. All right. And we drink. Ah, that is good. That's delicious. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So we're back with Lisa. Welcome back. Thank you. Thanks for having me again. It's great to have you back. So, Head Brewer out here it heater. Alan and I always get this wrong. Is it brewing? Yep. Okay, I'll bring. Okay, because there's Brewing's and breweries. Exactly. Yeah, it gets very confusing. Okay, So, heater Alan Brewing. Did I get that right? Yes. Okay. Okay. Heater Alan Brewing. I got that right. And actually, no, it doesn't say it on the beer mugs. So we're good and we're drinking to the I guess you said you just put on tap today. Yeah, we just released these two beers, and so the mark you're drinking the festive ear, which is so if you were to goto Octoberfest in Munich, you would drink what is often referred to as a season. It's similar to an export logger. Um and so that's what this is. It's Ah, Take on, um, the recipe that we did last year for a neck sport lager, which actually won a gold medal of the organ beer words. So, yes, that, sir. And then I am drinking the McMinnville Harvest Logar, which we did in collaboration with Visit McMinnville and allegory brewing. And it is a German style pilsner that is hot with Will Lam It, um which we can get into since Ah, we're talking cops. Yes. It's gonna ruin the surprise. I feel like the guests shouldn't say what we're talking about. No, that's fine. It's all good. There's there's, like, no rules here. Swing it. Yeah, that's one rule. Yeah, but, um Well, Amit hops at one point were the most widely grown hop in Oregon, So we thought it was kind of fitting in fitting, Especially since hops are grown in the Willamette Valley for the most part. Yeah, And and this is harvest season right now, is it? It is. Yeah. Hop harvest usually starts in mid august, um, for organ and, um and I believe for Washington and Idaho as well, which are the three main states where Hopps were grown in the U. S. On and then they're all varieties are harvested at different times. Um, so a lot of times harvest goes into October early October, depending on what variety and location excellent. The secrets out. We're talking hops, although it's it's kind of in the episode name, too. So, um, then then now they have so and I thought this was kind of important to talk about because, uh, well, I said, we all drink beer. A lot of people drink beer, and it's excellent, and a lot of people talk about hops. And no, this is Ah, hoppy beer. And, oh, it's a nine p a or to this it's of that. But I I know me personally. And in some conversations I've had with people, I think a lot of people I talked to don't fully understand much about hops other than their hops in there bidder and they go in beer. Yeah, Yeah, it's, um uh I think I would agree with you. I think that's what a lot of people, um, just beer drinkers, unless they've, you know, delved into the subject. Don't really know exactly what hops are used for. And so there's There's four, and I just kind of hit on this. There's four key ingredients in beer. I mean, in a basic dearest let's just because there's a ba jillion other things. Exactly. Bond. That's an official measurement right there. But, Gillian, I'm going with it. Actually, I think it might even be a real number, but someone will correct me if I'm wrong. Uh, so it's hops malt, some sort of malt, Which would be, ah, usually a grain, et cetera. We may talk about that a little bit today. I'm permitting water and yeast. Correct? Yes. Yeah, usually for most of time for beer. When you're talking about mult, you're talking about barley, Malted barley, wheat and rye are used as well. But, um, and other grains, rice, corn um, those air considered add junks, which I believe we talked about in the logger episode as well. But for the most part, when you're talking malt, inferior talking barley um, yeah. So wheat and rye aren't as efficient in producing sugars as bar Leah's, and they have a lot of protein in them, which makes them a pain to brew with. Okay, well, that explains why barley is the more common than you. Okay, Excellent. So now this is gonna be, like, a very wide ranging question which does not have any easy answer whatsoever, but if you could boil it down. Um What What is hops? What? Our hops. That Let's do it that way. What are hops? Because I speak English. Yeah. Um, So what are hops and and, you know, again, I'm kind of on that overview high level. Yeah. So, um, just in general, from a plants a plant sense, hops are a type of plant they grow on. I'm horrible with plants, so I do not know any of the technical term. I'm not gonna trust nobody, but I do know that they are related. Thio marijuana. Okay, um, and hemp. But they s o they grow on a vine. And, um, when you the hot flowers what it's called, that's where you're going to get the the flavor and the roman all that from those little flowers. They kind of look like pine cones. And that's what you're So when you're picking hops, that's what you want. You want those little flowers that are on the vine in a general term, hops in beer, Uh, in a lot of ways. Originally were used as a preservative because a lot of stuff can't grow in this kind of mixture that hops produce the acidity in all of that. Yeah, And then I you know, I did a little bit of research coming in here, so I'm not completely blind, but definitely you're the expert. That kind of surprised me a little bit, A couple of things. First of all, you said, it's kind of a vine, kind of a climbing plant. It's it's not. I guess I always pictured is a bush or a tree or something. But it's actually a vine of some sort and that the hops are flowers because, you know, I guess I had seen them is like little cone looking things. And I think I just assumed they were seeds of some sort, right? And they had a look almost seat like, Yeah, they kind of do. And it's what you actually want from the hop. What you're you're trying to get at is it's not the plant material itself. If you pick up a hop, you can like, pull back the pedals or leaves, whatever. I don't know again the technical term. What, ah, hot farmer would call them. Yeah, and there's like, this green kind of dusty looking stuff on, and that's actually what as brewers we want. That's so that depending on the variety, you'll have different acids in that and different flavors and all of that, which is what what you want from the hops and what the hot producers essentially are trying to utilize. So a lot of time this time of year, people are used to doing fresh hot beers. And for that you're using the whole flower a lot of the time. Brewers air using pellets, hot pellets there some breweries that do, and especially in English brewing. You use a lot of the whole flower, and it's at that point, it's not fresh. It's been dried, so it will. It will last longer, but you're using these little pellets that kind of look like rabbit food. And that's what cause that's utilizing all of the kind of stuff that's in in the flower, and it makes it a lot easier for cleanup and all of that sort of stuff. And I saw those in, uh in a and I know somewhere in my travels here on they do they look like something you would feed to a rabbit or I don't know, a durable around or what whatever road you choose. Ah, and that, I think kind of surprised me a little bit, but that was that's, like, very common. I'd always again, I think I imagine them fresh and or dried somehow hold. But really, they're just kind of extracting that essential parts out of it. And then that's what you're brewing with normally, right? Yes, yeah, And there's also, I mean, nowadays there's a bunch of different products to theirs. Hop, extracts and, um, which is what like a lot of the big breweries will use, which is essentially like a hot oil. Um, but most most craft brewers used the pellets because they're the most efficient way to use. There are some breweries. Sierra Nevada is very known for using whole hops on. And like I said, a lot of English breweries will use the the whole hops, and that derives a different flavor from the whole hop than you do from the pellets. It's just a little bit more efficient to use the pelvis. Yeah, no, it makes sense. It makes a lot of sense, you know, when you think about it again. I just imagine it is one of those things where you imagine one thing. And then the reality is a little bit right. Yeah, totally. Yeah. And so you talked about this a little. We talk about kind of different forms that come in, and I guess there's for again for my light research. Here there's there's generally two kinds. There's a bettering kind and an aroma kind correct. So, yes, and one more for flavor. One sport more for smell or yes, no eso ones. You have bitter, bettering hops. You have aroma, hops, and then you have hops that could be used for bettering or aroma for a bit. Oring hop. You want hop that's high in Alfa acid, and that's the acid that's going to create more bitterness. I mean, all hops have this, so it's just that some hops are really high in it, and others are very low, like, for example, in our Pilsner we use check saws, and the alfa acid, for that is usually around 3%. And if I can look really quick in my little cheating book I have here you have, ah, hop like Mosaic, which is a very popular I p a hop, and that has a like Alfa acid anywhere from around like 12 to around 14. Just that's a ballpark number, but so, like, I mean, but again, Mosaic is actually uses in a room, a hop. And that's one of those Hopp set. You can get bitterness from it, which I think is why it's popular is an i. P. A hop. And it also, you know, has a very nice aroma and flavor to it. Yeah, and so the row. And so I guess that's it. So the bitterness, one's arm or going thio. And again, if I'm getting this right, which I think it's us to a little bit of into, What do they actually do? Yes, so the bitterness is is and and again I'll let you talk, you're saying. But if I understand this correctly, correct me. The bitterness is is offsetting the sweetness, and that is going to kind of come from the malt because that generally is where the sugars and a lot of that comes from, and then the aroma would be more of that. The smell in the flavor. Yeah, right. Okay, yeah. Yeah. So and so when you're adding hops, there's multiple times everyone has their, you know, when they add hops and all of that. But when you add the hops to the wart is going, it's going thio do different things if you add early in the boil, or like a first word hoppy in which actually we do for all of our beers, that's gonna create a the bitterness flavor and then depending on during the boil. When you add hops, that's gonna do things like the flavor and aroma. The later you get in, the Boyle is more towards aroma, and then you can have dry hopping, which that adds flavor and aroma as well. And that's done a different breeze at different times. But that's usually you're adding in beer. We talk about the hot side on the cold side, and the hot side is when you're actually producing the war. The cold side is after you've moved it into fermenter, and so dry hopping is done on the cold side, and most other hopping is done on the hot side, Um, and ah, and so then also with bitterness. Any time you add, hops are going to add a small amount of bitterness just because that's the nature of hops. There a bitter product and same is true with, like flavor and aroma. Whenever you add hops, you're going to get a little bit of those flavor aroma elements to your beer. But it's less less so. So it's, you know, I don't know. I'm making sense and you know it. It makes perfect sense, actually, Even not, At least I'm understanding. And five year I can follow it. Most people confined. No, that makes sense. And so we've talked about the bettering to balance the amount in the preserve. And that's kind of you're saying And then So the one goes into the in the heat process. That's for the bettering. And then the more of the roamer flavor kind of goes more into the cold. You can add on the hot side so say you're doing for an example 70 minute boil and so you're you boil the war thio. Sanitize it. That's not the right word I'm thinking of, but that's the word. I can think of something going with like you're making sure essentially everything that could be in there is, you know you're killing that in a 70 minute boil. If you add something like towards the beginning of that boiled time, that's going to add bitterness. If you add stuff closer to the end of that boiled time, that's going to create flavor and aroma. That's gonna be more towards flavor and aroma. And that makes sense because a lot of things they kind of cook off exactly. Yeah, yeah, And then, in addition, a lot of people do dry, hoppy, and so we don't we've done. We've dry hot the couple of our beers, but we don't hardly ever dry hop. And then there's some breweries that dry, hopped, every single beer they dio. So it kind of just depends on what type of barrier producing got it. That means that totally makes sense. When we talked about that that it is, it kind of helps. I think we've covered this in with some of the preservatives in there. Like you said, they kill off a lot of the other stuff that's in there and help them preserve longer. And I guess that that was something that was discovered, You know, through the process that said, Hey, when we brew with hops, they last longer. Yeah, Yeah. Died less often, I guess. Exactly. Hey, stuff isn't growing in this anymore. Yeah, which takes some of the fun out. I don't know if this is it's Yeah, it's kind of a crazy time bag. Yeah, right. And it's kind of crazy if you think about living in that time. I know it's just I don't know how they did it, but, you know, I go technology. Yeah, and the fact that pretty much people drank like beer and wine and alcohol because it wouldn't make them sick whereas like normal water would. So it's like Was everyone just walking around drunk all the time like, Yeah, it's like, Well, and actually I've got ah, fun fact here. And it said that basically, in the 1200 or so was common a lot. Mentor, if you will, was one gallon of ale or beer or whatever per person per day s o on. I'm like, that's That's like a lot. And I know they're alcohol was like a lot lower, but that just still seems like it seems like a lot of fear, right? So, actually, maybe life wasn't that bad. Yeah, I have that. Much of your life gets good. Yeah. Now eso we talk are we hinted a little bit how it affects the flavor, but it's supposed to have floral, fruity, citrusy kind of flavors is yeah, So, depending on what hop you use, your gonna get different flavors again. Using Heater Alan as an example, we use a lot of what are called noble variety hops, and these tend to be more like earthy floral flavors. They do have, like fruity flavors as well, but they tend to lean more to the floral side. And then you have kind of American hops kind of lean. More Citrus, I would say. So they're like Citrus fruity and especially some of the newer hops that have been developed recently. You get some of those tropical flavors. Yeah, that are really interesting and fun that I don't get to use you Never. You know it's still fun is still fun finding breweries that make those fears and getting to try them. So and then there's also, you know, you can get all sorts of flavors. I think that's another mis conception from people that are primarily used to drinking wine. And they're like a beer's just beer. And it's like, Oh, no, there's like all of these fruity flavors as well, Like you can get all these different elements in it on bats. Still, just using those four basic ingredients. That's what's so great, right? And that alone, all the other things you could add in Yeah, yeah. So, um, Hayat hops can definitely ah, add a lot of cool stuff Thio to your beer, especially if you do it right. So, yeah, right. And that that's, um and there's a lot. I mean, I'm not gonna I don't think any Well, maybe somebody somewhere could but name all the different or how many Actually, someone could look up how many different ways, But there's, like a jillion again. That's a good number. Yeah, exactly different kinds of hop. So it's really just kind of going through an identifying like like you that these are the ones that work with Are our water are you star? Malti get produced the best flavor Exactly. And I mean there is a preference to of like, you know, they'll be certain breweries that you're like, Oh, they use a lot of you know, this hop. Um, just because they really like it and they use it a lot of years, and that kind of becomes one of their flavor profiles. Yeah, there's a bunch of different kinds of hops, and it takes a while to kind of develop hop style. But Oregon State University in Corvallis, they have a brewing in fermentation science program, and they work actually a lot on development of different hops. So you even see at hot fields? Um, sometimes you'll get even. They'll come by and bring you samples and stuff like that and just be like, this is a new hop we're developing. What do you think? Do you want to use it? Um, and there's been one hot recently lemon drop, which we actually using a beer. Um, that was very lemony, and it almost like it tastes like it sounds like it tastes like a lemon drop. It has. It's, like, kind of citrusy note. And then it's almost like, has this slight, sweet finish. Um, so, yeah, now, now, I just had a curiosity because you've been doing this for ah while. Can you, like, smell, taste the dry hopping. An idea what that's going to do? The beer. Do you actually have to brew to get to What if it's gonna work for you or not? Does that make sense? Yeah. I think that, uh, it's kind of a little bit of both. It really helps Thio, uh, you can. I mean, I feel for me personally, and I think this is different for probably every brewer for me personally, Um, if I'm smelling a hop, I can kind of get some elements that I you know, I kind of have an idea that will show up in a beer and stuff like that and how Yeah, I have an idea from just smelling it, but I really feel like you don't really know how that hop is gonna do in a lot of cases until you actually brew with it. Um, there's a hop that we we used it for bettering, and it smelled really nice. And we're like, we should see if this would work is an aroma hop. And it did not. So, um, like, and it smelled really nice when you, like, took it out of the package. and smelled it. But it just like it was like, Nope. This is one of those things, like just bitterness. Like you do not want to use this for aroma. And then there's hops that I've been, like, super skeptical of including, actually the lemon drop top and then tried it in a beer. And I was like, Actually, this is very nice. So so do you do like, some small bruise a little tiny Bruce for that kind of stuff? No, we just, you know, go go full bore. Yeah. Okay. Well, the diarist, I love it. And so if we ever see it on sale, it's super think this single hot dog on the end. And I want to dive a little bit into, um, I be used or international bitterness. Bitterness, units. I can say it. I can speak. We haven't even had that much beer weigh half a beer. All right, but before we do that real quick, are there a lot of and I don't think there are very many, But are there a lot of like no hot beers out there or I mean, I'm assuming there are And what does that due to the flavor, they dramatically different or s o. There's a beer called a Grew it and it grew. It is kind of historically what a lot of people believe to be what people used in beer before they discovered hops. So it's usually a lot of herbs and spices and stuff like that. And recently there's been kind of a resurgence, and people doings that style of beer. For most fears, there's there's at least a little bit of hops in there. We make a Bavarian style wheat beer, and it is super low in hops, like we hardly use any hops in that at all. It's like it is. It really makes my job a lot easier, just like Luke like that, that's all. That's all. I'm done with that. So yeah, a lot of beers, even if they're super low, so like that, that's a Bavarian half of ice and, um, a lot of beers that have a lot of like yeast arrived. Flavors often will be low and hops, Um, but most beers do have a little bit of hops, except for like a grew it. So it's good. It's basically super rare to find beer without hops. Yeah. Yeah. Even like you know, people. Even like a sour beer and stuff like that. You use a little bit. You'll use a little bit of hopping in there. It just won't be enough to really detect in a lot of ways. Okay, well, then let's talk. I be used because they're kind of like I don't know that the rage these days the kids were all doing it. Yeah, but you see it everywhere. And there's a lot of talk around for the last few years at least. You know, the higher numbers must be more bitter, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't know. Can you give us some insight into Yes. So I view It's kind of like it's it's really hard to measure. I be used appropriately, and one of the reasons is, as everyone has a different like bitterness threshold. So something that's like has in I've use. I'm using quote fingers here and I an eye view of like 26 let's say, is going to taste completely different to me than it issue. And then also another thing with that is that it's gonna taste different if it's in, say, a beer like a hell issa super light longer or like a stout. So, you know, I think that's the thing that's hard with I b. Use that. I feel like a lot of brewers are kind of going against the i. D. You measurement these days just because, especially with dry hoppy. And it's very hard to measure the exact ivy You, um, and people's perception of it. But yes, typically, like the higher, um, the higher the Ivy, you, the more bitterness you're going to get, Um, since the name International Bitterness Units. But again, it's not taking into account perceived bitterness because stouts are often have, you know, quite a bit of hops and quite a bit of bitterness in them, like Sable haven't I? Bu of 40 which is pretty high, but you're not going to perceive as much hops in that beer is. You would even an I P. A. That's an idea of 40 which I p a fan's air, probably like. That's pretty low for an I V a writer. I'm a logger, brewer. People well and a lot of people do, and I've heard, although I think I'm hearing it less, and I think you're right. People would be like, Oh, it's Ah, whatever. It's Ah 100 i p and the f B i p i b you. And they got, like, super excited about it. But I think like you, the more I read about it. The more I learned about it is, you know, they're not, they don't know, super translate because it depends on the malt and everything else and how much they're balancing out. And you can have one. That's Ah, you know, a 61 that's a 50 in the fifties. Gonna taste a lot more bitter. Exactly 60. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, it's just it's really hard. It's It's just a really, really hard to measure and especially with, I think the like New England or the hazy, juicy Sile I p. A. Is that a really popular right now? It's kind of going against the tide of bitterness, so those tend to be a little bit, um, like a little bit sweeter on the finish and less bitter, like a traditional English I p. A or West Coast I p. A. Taken with a grain of salt. Higher is more bitter, but not always, and you like better maybe look for higher ones, but otherwise just drink what you like. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Drink what you like. So well, let's take a couple minutes if you don't mind and dive a little bit into malt because then I mean we've talked to you know, yeast is a whole nother thing, and water is a whole nother thing. Uh, from my understanding, malt is really kind of one of the I mean, that's kind of your foundation. Almost Yes, that is. Malt is multi, is very important. It is definitely the foundation foundation of a beer. So, like I mentioned earlier in the podcast barley, when in beer, when you're talking mall, your most frequently talking barley barley is very efficient at collecting sugars that are easy to utilize to, you know, create the sugars that used to want to eat to make alcohol. Also, like I mentioned earlier, you can also use a lot of people use wheat. You usually don't do a beer. That's 100% wheat because it's very has a lot of protein in it. It's not as efficient. You're not going thio get us much sugar from the mall and same with rye, but those were kind of votes. Rice, corn. It's what I guess is known. A cereal grain. Yes. Yeah, cereal grains. And so, like, just throwing this out there because I know nothing. So you can tell me I'm an idiot, but I just look at this. And Rice and my kudos rights. I thought Would that be like a lot of the Japanese beers? Probably. There are even more bar. There are some breweries to do. I'm sure I actually don't specifically know if I'm sure there's Japanese breed chunk of Ryan's. Yeah, you're right. Okay. Thank you. But I don't know for sure. So Budweiser actually uses rice. That's their address that Budweiser uses. So rice is actually hard to extract sugars from, so it really is Because Budweiser likes that flavor probably would be easier if they used 100%. Barley. Rice is kind of a pain to brew with, cause you have to boil it before you can utilize any of the sugars. But so anyway, dear eligible. But way back. So I'm barley. I is number one easiest and best. So you take your barley. How do you make it? Ah, malt. What do you do you do to malted and whatever small? It sounds so yummy. Yeah. So, yeah. Chocolate malts and run like whoppers and stuff like that. Um, yeah. So what you do is you harvest the barley. It's really funny because it's just like you're like, You grow the barley with water and then you go thio, you take, you harvest it, you soak in water, you start to germinate it. Then you dry it really fast. And then and then you toast it, you kill Mitt. And there's different. There's kind of different levels of of barley. So, like a bass malt, those air usually gonna be like your pills normal. It's a like a pale ale. Maltese air just there. Pretty much germinated, dried really fast. And then, uh, they're killed. And then, um, you have caramel malts which are roasted, and oftentimes those help add color and flavor. The reason why you add water and you rehydrate the barley is you're essentially kind of forcing it to start to grow. And then by drawing it, you're stopping it. And so what happens is this is easier to I don't know how well I'm gonna be able to explain this. It's not usually when I explain this people, I draw pictures. Okay, So audio is gonna be a little tough, but essentially so if you think of it, you have a barley kernel. And when it germinates, there's this, like, kind of a group of sugars that start to grow up along the side because that's essentially going to help this little sprout that's going to start growing that's going to that's gonna be its food. But what you do so right before the sprouts, sprouts and some it depends on how the ultra is doing it. Sometimes they do let it sprout a little bit. Sometimes they stop it before it comes out of the colonel. So you stop it so that the brewers can utilize those sugars. And then so the process of ah, when you're brewing, you actually crack the grains, you crack the colonels and that exposes the sugar. And then, by adding water and stuff like that, you're creating using the sugars, and then the sugars air what you're fermenting. And by the way, too, I'm a little sad you can't draw the picture. But I'm also a little sad people can't see. I mean, you had the hands go, and that was awesome. That was amazing. But that actually made perfect sense. I think you explained it very, very well. Basically, what I found interesting is that, like the color of the beer, basically is the amount of roasting that you're doing at the end, right? Are maybe not roasting. I don't talk to me about that because you're there all. It could be the same from a from a very pale ale all way to a very dark stout. And it's the same thing. You're just you're Yeah, you're using. So you're using different malt. In brewing, we have base malts, which I mentioned that that's like a pale ale mall. A pills normal. Those are also a Munich malt of the animals. Those were kind of typical base malts, Pilsner, that I'm drinking that is very pale. It is pretty much 100% pills normal. We used a tiny bit of a roasted mall. Roasted malts help add color, and also some of those based multi talked about are also going to create a darker color. So we do a beer called Schwartz, which is like a Ah, boo Veer or not a Bavarian Sorry, A bohemian dark lager that we the baseball for that is a Munich malt. And that just adds more color without adding because you don't. The problem with roasted malt is they will add a bunch of color, but they're most of them. Aren't that firm edible? So you don't want to D'oh um, a beer with a bunch of roasted malts Because then you're not It's not going to be You're not gonna create a very formidable wart, so people usually, I mean, it depends on the beer style that you're making. I can't off the top of my head. I'm horrible at remembering numbers, but it's usually most people try to stick within a certain percentage of of roasted malts, and they try to stay with that. And it's I mean, you can look up if you look up your styles. A lot of them will sometimes say, like usually around this percentage of roasted malt. So, yeah, that makes perfect sense. We talked about how the hops come in. How did the barley come in as actually like barley seeds kind of thing or what? What form does that kind of comics that I haven't seen. The barley. They harvest it. They would pretty much most other grains. I actually haven't seen barley harvested before. I've seen wheat for, like, bread harvested before, but it's essentially kind of the same process. Like you using a combine to get in what you're trying to get our the little like kernels. Um and so, yeah, if you look a TTE brewing barley versus just like fresh barley, it's going to probably look slightly different. And obviously, the Bruin barley is gonna be crunchier and dried and all of that, but yeah, it's essentially just a little kernels. That colonel, they dry them, they ship him, you put him back in the water. Reached Exactly. Put it back in water again. And keep keep the water go in the water. You've got the malts which were given you your sweet. They're fighting sugars that ferment. Um, and they're also creating this Theo to in the beer. Well, so the the yeast creates the CEO to the fermentation? Yes. Not forget I said that does that. And then the hops are balancing the sweetness and bring in an additional flavors. Yes. Yeah. Okay, and then water and Easter Wholenother conversations for Exactly. It's okay. A whole nother thing. Awesome. Anything else? You wanna, um, go on a fun fact here. Gotta throw one of those out just cause I have it. The use of hops was first documented in the ninth century. So it's doing it for, like a little while. Yeah, just a little, Actually. Not that that long, considering 90 beer's been around a whole lot longer than that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So any of the parting thoughts or anything on that? I don't think so. Okay. Well, then let's let's go ahead and wrap this up.
