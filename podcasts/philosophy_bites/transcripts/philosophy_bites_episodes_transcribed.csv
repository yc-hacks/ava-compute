That's metaphysics. Philosophers have bean reflecting on metaphysics for millennia. Some of the theories they've come up with seemed down like wacky. But Emily Thomas of Durham University believes we can still learn from them. Emily Thomas Welcome to Frustrate Bites. Hi, nice to be here. The topic we're going to talk about is wildly implausible metaphysics. Now, before we get onto the wildly implausible but just recap. What is metaphysics? Metaphysics is the part of philosophy that studies reality. So a lot of philosophy is looking at man's place in the world, wondering what the universe it's metaphysics is the bit that really wonders what the universe is. So this is distinct from science in the olden days, if you go back three centuries or more messy physics was not distinct from science. They were very much intertwined, doing the same kind of thing. For in the 17th century onwards, you get a divergence, and now science tends to study the physical material world. But metaphysics thinks that there are a lot of questions open that science doesn't cover. So questions like what actually is the physical material world. That's a metaphysics. But what about the wildly implausible bit? So I spend most of my time working on the history of metaphysics on large parts of it are wildly implausible. They sound absolutely bonkers when he advice come across them. Nonetheless, I think they're really valuable to look at. If these theories are wildly implausible, what's the point of even thinking about them? One of the reasons I find them absolutely fascinating is that although the conclusion sound implausible? The arguments forthem can actually be really simple and compelling. Can you give an example? I can I can talk you through a couple. So let's start with a metaphysical view advanced by on Conway in the 16 seventies. Conway has a view that the whole universe, everything in it is alive. This view is known as vital ism, and I think that sounds implausible. First sight. We tend to think that we're alive and plants and animals are alive. Everything else in the world Hills, mountains, stars, planets are not alive and free philosophy. To say that they are sounds really peculiar. So I suppose there is a modern day version of that with a guy. Our hypothesis, the idea that the whole plan is to somehow live from the bits that seemed to be dead, just like thinking as and hear the parts of a bigger system. Yeah, Conway would definitely say the old universe is one big system, and she has a couple of different reasons for advancing that view. One big problem she's trying to answer is how we as conscious beings interact with our bodies. It seems like our minds or something special. They're different from the natural world. You know, we have this weird property of thinking and feeling, and that seems to be different from everything else around us. One advantage of saying everything in the world is alive is that you eliminate the question of how to things that are so different. Mind and matter can interact. So she's getting rid of that interaction problem entirely. Now you might well be thinking, Well, all right, fine. Let's get rid of that interaction problem. But why not just say everything is material? Surely that system plant's been saying everything is alive, and that's where her second argument comes in. Conway, back in the 17th century, is really worried about God's relationship with creation, as almost all European philosophers were back then. One question that Conway asks that almost no other philosopher asks is, How is it that God could create something different from himself? God, we assume, is a living, thinking, conscious, being matter. The stuff of tables and chairs and mountains and stars isn't any of those things, and Conway think that leads to another interaction problem between God, who's living in thinking and matter which is not living. I'm not thinking so by making everything in the world alive, she's eliminating that second interaction problem as well. God can create living things because we are like him. But that seems weird in another way because traditionally, God created the earth and created non living things as well as living things. So in standard Christian metaphysics, you'd assume that the release two kinds of things around in the world because God made them. For most Christians for era, the Bible would have been providing the premises from which you argue. It seems to me that the premises within the Bible actually lead to at least a dualism of stuff. Conway would say The Bible doesn't write anything about dualism. The Bible tells us that God creates the living things that move upon the earth on the mountains, on the stars. But the Bible says nothing about what they're made off, whether their material or physical. And so Conway thinks matter. Physics is fully compatible with these biblical stories. And what's more, she thinks that it's an improvement upon the traditional philosophies of her time because she gets to say that God, this grand living being would never create anything dead interesting. Now, presumably from some perspectives, this is an advance on the kind of Cartesian dualism that would have been pretty much prevalent in her day. So for those people who are materialists, it's sort of a step in the right direction because there's only one kind of stuff. Yeah, absolutely. So back in the 17th century, almost all everyone was a Cartesian duelist from the 16 forties onwards, and Conway thinks that Jewel is, um, is riddled with problems. Both of these interaction problems being some of them, and she can fix that. Her metaphysics is preferable to day cots, so in this case, she's got a wildly implausible conclusion. But what you're interested in is how she arrived in conclusion. Why, yes, absolutely. And I think that how she arrived at that conclusion on why I find the arguments there really simple and there will stay compelling. Let's consider another example then. Well, if you like, we could consider pans. I give him as another example. So Pan Sikhism was resurrected in the 19 twenties by the philosopher and physicist Arthur Eddington, sees a British physicist and philosopher best known for its physics, but also and too deep into metaphysical territory, and Eddington advances really again simple and compelling argument for pan psych ism. So Eddington is looking at the world that science tells him about, and he thinks that we never have direct access to the world around us. What we have access to you are readings on scientific instruments. He describes these instruments as dials. He talks about how we only have pointed readings, that point of being the little arrow on a dial that points to one number. Another, Eddington thinks that we don't have access to the nature of reality. As it is, we just have access to these measurements to these signs and symbols of reality. But that leads Addington to ask, What is the nature of reality? And his suggestion is, the only thing we really know about reality is that it contains conscious beings like us. So he looks inside his head. He finds a conscious being. He doesn't know what's outside his head. He's only got thes pointer readings, thes signs and symbols that he thinks maybe what's inside my head is a clue to what's outside. So maybe everything else that out there is conscious as well on this argument depends. Sikhism became really popular. Lots of people didn't like it, but lots of people did. But maybe it's not a clue to what's outside. That's equally possible. It is possible. But if you have no other information than making an inference from the data that you do have to the data that you don't is something that we do all the time. We don't know what the far side of the universe is like, but we assume it's gonna be something like the part that we live in. So because I speak English, I seem that they speak English in India. Yeah, if you didn't have any data about what language people spoke in other places, that seems like a reasonable inference to make. It's not a knockdown argument in the sense that you might be wrong about. And maybe Eddington is wrong about this part of reality that he doesn't have access to. But it seems like a sensible suggestion, even if all the dials air coherently telling me a story that seems to imply that there are physical objects, not just mental objects. If the Dial's could tell that story, then sure, then his suggestion that everything out there is conscious would seem to be ill founded. But Eddington would argue the dials are telling him any such thing. The dials air telling him how hot something is, how big something is, how quick it's moving. Dials can tell us all those same things about human beings on we're still conscious. So it's not obviously the case that your scientific readings can tell you what the nature of the real world is like. Eddington would say that when we're interacting with tables and chairs were not actually interacting with the true stuff that they really are. So he would say a table seems to be a solid, hard resistant surface. But the reality is that this table is composed of atoms with gigantic gaps between them that the table is mostly empty space. Sometimes he talks about Werling, vortis, ease of force that that's really what happens when you push down on a table. So he'd want to say, we just don't have access to reality as it really is. You might think that we do, but we really don't now. This is another example, obviously of the topic we're talking about, which is wildly implausible metaphysical conclusions. What's the value of looking at Harrington's approach here? What can it give us? I think that looking at Eddington arguments are really valuable. Their forces us to ask questions about how we perceive reality. So do we really think that we are not in touch with reality as it really is? Do we really think that science has access to the true nature of reality in a way that humans directly don't Eddington forces us to ask how much we know about the world outside ourselves? In science, there might be some value in looking at bad science, but most scientists look ATT conclusions, which they could build on which a cutting edge as it were. But it was to be recorded from look ATT really weird, strange arguments from the past trying to understand them in their context. So could some of the value be understanding that our concepts change over time? Our Presumptions change over time. Our background Setzer premises change over time so inevitably, metaphysics will change over time. I think one of the peculiar thing about philosophy is that it's not obvious when we're making progress, and this is especially true matter, physics. Our views of our reality are, as you say, deeply embedded in our wider network of beliefs. But what? Looking at the history of matter physics can do is flag up assumptions that we don't even necessarily realize our assumptions. So we tend to assume that the universe outside ourselves, mountains and stars is not conscious is not alive. Metaphysics can make us question that on every now and then. Thes arguments for what seemed to be really bizarre views are picked up by contemporary philosophers and brushed off because the philosophers think actually, that's a really great argument. Something like that has happened in the case of end. His views were picked up over the last few decades by Galen Straw Orson. He's advanced a new argument for pan psych ism that heavily draws on what he takes to be these key insights of Eddington. So in some cases, you might think the only reason to look at these seemingly implausible views is to help us realize the assumptions that air going into constructing our well views today. But other times you think no, these arguments are so good, but we should be using them looking at these historical metaphysical theories, it can provide a fresh take on our own 21st century matter. Physical theories. And that's where part of their value lies. Could you give just one more example of a weird metaphysical theory? I can give you one last example. In the early 18th century, the Scottish philosopher David Hume advanced the view that we have no itself now, up until Hume, Western philosophers always assumed that I am a kind of being that has some kind of unchangeable core and that that cool persists over time. And maybe it changes from moment to moment. So you might think that I'm wondering around London right now I'm acquiring the memories. I'm having different thoughts and feelings. But inside me there is an Emily Nous that doesn't change. That is merely acquiring changing properties. And that view, I think, is really widely held back then and today. That's why we tend to think it makes sense to talk about Emily of five years ago, when Emily of Five minutes ago, because there is some court Emily Nous that's there. Hume comes along and says, Hang on a second. Let's look inside ourselves and see whether we actually introspect or perceive any core Emily Nous and Hume says that we don't when we look inside ourselves. Well, we perceive are fleeting thoughts and feelings. And so he wants to say the All Emily is is a bundle of thes thoughts and feelings. There's no course elf at all. So one way of reading Hume is to say that for Hume, he doesn't think that people remain the same over time. It doesn't make sense to talk about Emily five years ago, and Emily now, because all there is is a constantly shifting bundle of impression. There's no core that somehow comprises identity. I guess whether you see that is wildly implausible today probably depends whether you're a Buddhist or not. That's true. So lots of Buddhists are red is holding this view that there is no such thing as a self in each human being. How radical you think that view is depends on how far you take it so human can be read as not just denying that we have a soul that changes over time, but in fact, that there is any core of our identity at all that changes over time, and if That's right. Then it means that I am not the same person I was five years ago. You are not this impasse and you were 20 minutes ago. So why should I take that seriously? Because I clearly am in some sense, the same person. Well, you might say that there is clear continuity between you now and you 20 minutes ago. You know, you have roughly the same body, maybe a few cells of James, but it's going to be roughly the same. You have roughly the same psychological makeup. We've added a few extra memories, but you might worry that these changes air enough to mean that you are no longer identical with your past self. There is continuities between you now and the person that was sitting here 20 minutes ago. But it's only continuity, no identity on If you miss read that way, then that becomes a really, really radical view because it means that from moment to moment persons are not identical with themselves. Now life is short. Philosophers have only got so much time to discuss things. Do you think it is a good way to spend your life looking at arguments with wildly implausible conclusions. I really do. Yeah, the precise ing that kinds of reasons we've been talking about. Although the conclusion sound wildly implausible, the arguments are often not on. That really forces you to ask the big questions about what you think about how life is, how reality is. I think that's really valuable.

What's the best way to work out how we should behave morally in different scenarios? Some philosophers like to start by developing principles, often through the use off imaginary examples called thought experiments. James Wilson, who teaches at University College London, believes this gets things the long way round. James Wilson Welcome to Philosophy Bites. Hello. The topic we're gonna focus on is really a world ethics Now, obviously your ethics in some senses in the real world. But what do you mean by real world ethics? I mean helping us to make wise decisions about real life situations. Very often, philosophers can talk about thought. Experiments are in very abstract terms, but the real world is actually much more complicated than that world that flossed was often like to think about. So a classic example of a thought experiment is the trolley problem, with the runaway train going towards five people on the tracks, and you could deflect it by putting a lever to kill one person instead. Should you do it? That's very, very much a simplified situation is almost like a diagram in most examples. How is the real world problem? Different from that? A real world problem is different in all kinds of ways, from a thought experiment. The first way, perhaps most obviously is or real world problems arise in a context and within a certain history, think about the way that they thought experiment is set up. You're just told that this Charlie is hurtling down towards five people in Europe. You're the points. You don't understand anything about why it was that the trolley is hurtling towards that when we never discovered anything about what will happen to the five people who get saved afterwards. Whereas real world problems that massively more complicated than that think. For example, if you try to divide ethical advice on somebody trying to solve a problem like the Arab Israeli conflict in the Middle East, it's a problem that goes back 100 or more years. And they're such a tough history of recrimination on both sides that you couldn't begin toe. Think that through in ethical terms without understanding the history as I understand it. One of the values of simplified thought experiments is that you can establish general principles, which you might then apply to more complex situations. Indeed, that's the theory that philosophers give us. In some cases, there may be something to that. James Rachel's has a classic thought experiment involving two people, Smith and Jones, and he's interested in Is there really a different tree, actively killing somebody and letting them die? And so he sets up to precisely matched cases where the only difference is that in one case, as a killing in another case letting die and most people think that Okay, yes. In that particular scenario, constructed there doesn't seem to be a moral difference between killing and letting die. But the questions what follows from that does it follow that there's never a difference between killing and letting die? I think that's too hasty a thing to draw on that very often context matters. And there could be other principles which interact in complicated ways and so that there's often a very deep set of questions and important question. We need to think about its Flosses. About what? How do you go from the simple case where things are clear to the real world case? So what you advocate getting away from thought experiments? Are they a distraction from real world ethics? I think in some ways, yes, but in other ways, no, so that I think the philosophers could do a lot by actually looking at the way that experiments used in science. So that first talk often and grand weighs about thought experiments, and it it makes it sound, is off. What they're doing is scientific, but you need to look very closely at the way that, for example, randomized clinical trials are used in testing for drug safety, a well designed clinical trial. It will tell you something about the effect of that drug on the particular trial population. But the particular trial population will often be quite specific. And it may be different from the people who actually finally want to use the drug to help. So that often the people inside the drug population maybe, for example, men between the age of 20 and 30 who otherwise healthy whereas the person that the doctor has in front of them may be in a much older woman with lots of other things wrong with her. And maybe an open question what the evidence from the clinical trial says about what would help this particular woman. I think a similar principle will apply. It thought experiments as well. It may be that you can establish something about a very specific and pared down case by using your thought experiment. You can show, for example, that in a world in which there really is a trolley hurtling towards you and all you can do is either pull a lever or choose not to pull a lever, then maybe you should pull the lever in orderto Save the five and let the one die. But what that tells you about cases of killing and letting die in real world situations dropped in war is very much up for grabs. So what's the alternative? I think there's a number of alternatives. May be the beginning of wisdom is to adopt a kind of pluralism to think about that sort of tools that you have available to. You know tool will be good for all sorts of problems or challenges. And again toe revert back the way that the scientists might think that a scientist is going to say, Well, okay, well, sure, there's all sorts of things that we could do with a a randomized clinical trial, but they're going to say, Well, we need real world evidence in addition to that so that we have to be aware of the sorts of things that we can get out of certain sorts of experiments and then calibrate those so that we don't put too much weight on them. I think that there are other sorts of techniques are ways of doing philosophy that don't rely so much on thought experiments. So, for example, you could look at very much richer cases. The use of literature is a good example. In that case, you have a world that's much more richly imagined. It's a world with real people. People were often with history of people. You can identify with an either sort of hate or or love, and in doing so, you could get inside a philosophical problem, maybe about what love is or what sorts of things that we should regret in a way that a thought experiment maybe never will be able to do. It's interesting you described fictional characters Israel people because they aren't other. Their imagined, I mean famously, someone wrote a paper about how many Children had Lady Macbeth. That just isn't an answer. There's no right answer because it's never mentioned by Shakespeare. She's not like a real person. He would have a specific number of Children, and she only does what she does in the place. He doesn't do anything else. Indeed, may be one thing Toe say is that a novel or a play is much more highly realized, much more highly thought out than I thought experiments. So there's a way that there's a real world that you can think your way into. And certainly if you're an actor playing the role of Lady Macbeth or Macbeth that Shakespeare's given enough, they're arrested or empathize with a beard, build a backstory, understand what the character is like. I would completely agree that Shakespeare hasn't told us everything about those people's lives, and there's a lot that we need toe fill in. But maybe that's just the beginning of wisdom that is never possible for somebody. Toe tell us everything about a life. In fact, even for our closest friends or the family members, we don't know them completely, either. Nonetheless, you can know people through knowing aspect off. Hm. And that may be enough to do good moral philosophy with It may be that you don't need to have an omniscient understanding of every single possible fact about somebody you ordered. Berto inhabit their world to understand what it's like and then use that as a way of reflecting ethically. Whether you go to a fictional characters, real people who have existed or do exist, it's still gonna be much more complicated than a thought experiment. So how does a philosopher go about deciding what the right thing to do if there is the right thing to do is in a particular situation when it is so complex. I think that's extremely good question. I think they're right to flag up the difficulty about thinking about real world situations in some ways. That's why it is that I think it's the most important form of ethical philosophy that we can do. The first thing to say in which I've experienced a lot through the work I've done pickle in public policy is that you shouldn't think of it in the way that some philosophers do that if you're just really, really smart and sit down at your table, drink a lot of tea and eat lot of Jeff Cakes and Sammy Lee, the answers will arrive rather that the answers you're looking for need to be constructed with the other people who are inside the problem situation for two reasons. First or as a philosopher, you are typically not as smart as you think you are. You're not as imaginative as you may think you are on that. A lot of the ethical problems and challenges that we faced are actually due to the way that other people interpret the world and the way they think about it. So a problem might be working on quite recently is problem of how to make sure that you get enough people who are willing to be vaccinated so that for something I say measles in orderto have herd immunity, you need to have at least 90% of the people vaccinated, maybe 95%. How do you ensure this is one thing is a philosopher state? Well, here's my ethical argument for it, but some people may not find that convincing so that other people say, Well, what we need to do is come up with an ethical argument for why it's OK for governments toe coerce people. In this kind of case, you begin to realize, after a little bit that that maybe actually quite counterproductive. It's something they began to try, and France and in Italy recently. But in Italy in particular, that very governmental support for compulsory vaccination is part of what's led to the rise of the five star movement. Taking steps which you think will improve compliance may in fact make it worse. If you have a backlash, you have to really understand things from the ground level and realize that there may not be one way of getting at the objective you're looking at. But rather there may be a variety of plausible perspectives, some of which you gotta try out and talk to the people who were involved in the problem. See which one of them is going to work best. Does that include talkto anti vax people? People who just refusing to vaccinate their Children? Of course, if you look about 5 10 years ago, there was a sort of a discourse of expertise where people imagine that almost in the way that English people do when they go abroad. Because if they just weren't shouting loud enough, is it what the expert needs? And you get some even bigger experts with more white coats on and tell people that they were wrong. I think the beginning of wisdom is speaking to understand. Why is it that people hold the views that they do? If it seems to be irrational, what makes it rational for them? And in the case of signing out anti vax, it seems to be quite clearly related toe maybe an overall collapse in faith in certain sorts of authority, just certain thoughts of expertise or unwillingness to take on trust the sorts of things that people in official positions tell them. Sometimes that may be deeply irrational, but there have been quite a number of cases over the last 10 15 years where it turned out that they have bean official conspiracies. You think of something Abou grave or what came out result of the Edward Snowden revelations, where it became clear that it wasn't it all it irrational to think that there may be conspiracies. It seems that we aren't gonna get any further merely by attempting to shout louder. Really, What we need to do is strike out. How do you rebuild trust in in science in democratic institutions? And the one useful way of doing that might be, rather than toe focus on the idea of objectivity and knowledge, but rather toe focus on the way in which trustworthiness is built within scientific discourse to focus on the checks and the balances, the ways in which scientific knowledge and peer reviewed science is itself a form of organized skepticism so that rather than science being other to what you believe if you're skeptical, you should be scientific. That kind of engagement with range of ideas gives you lots of information they might give you, as it were. Rhetorical strategies for changing people's opinions. The weather's of philosophy coming. Where's the ethics? What makes this ethics and not just nudging? I think what makes her ethics is Do you have some concern for truth for rationality? But I guess I should put my cards on the table. That philosophy Rama pragmatist. So I tend to be very skeptical about the idea that philosophical truths are somehow out there to be grasped, as if the truth had been there all along. Rather, I think that philosophical problems that nicely, socially constructed one good example might be in the realm of epistemology. It's really interesting fact that suddenly, around the late eighties, early nineties, phosphorus became deeply interested in testimony. When they're tired of being hardly any writing on testimony within epistemology before now, why is that as a practiced, I think that the obvious answer to that is it's about the rise of the World Wide Web. Suddenly, people have access to more more information than they ever had before, and it raised questions about the trustworthiness of that information, how it's possible to get knowledge from sources that are far away. That is difficult to check, which had never really bean so salient before. I tend to think that's exactly what happens in lots of other philosophical arenas. A lot of my work has bean in healthcare. Ethics in the 19 fifties is relative attempts toe control polio and find a way of treating people for it. You see the invention of the respirator. Now, with the respirator, you're suddenly able to keep people alive who would otherwise have died very quickly. But often for days, months, even years, all sorts of questions suddenly arise about the nature of death, which hadn't previously arisen. It may be that you can keep someone's heart pumping and blood going around their body, their skin pink almost indefinitely. But they're higher. Brain functions have completely stopped. Suddenly, questions arise, which requires a philosophical thought, which hadn't really arisen before. I think that that's what genuine philosophical theorizing is all about. It's about working out one of the hardest and most difficult problems which have the recent in society that we can't deal with with other sorts of means. I know you thought about using Twitter as a source of information for some of your research. Could you say something about that? Yes. I was involved in a project a couple of years ago called I Sense. What the project is trying to do is to build a new generation of ways of detecting and responding to disease almost to build what they described early warning system for disease detection. One of the things they became very interested in is what can we find out about disease detection, where diseases air going from the sorts of things that people post onto Facebook or on Twitter? One of things that they were interested in doing seemed on the face of it completely innocuous. They wanted to take things that people had posted on Twitter public things that anybody couldn't search and then use those as a way of tracking disease to see you could work out, for example, how large a particular flu outbreak is or where it's moving, too. In order to think this through, Benedict run Bold and I, who work on this project together, we looked at it a bit more broadly and other things that we discovered is that things could be potentially much more controversial than you might imagine. Back in 2014 Samaritan to a well known UK and Irish charity whose job it is toe work in suicide prevention. Try to do something very similar. They set up a system called Radar. If you signed up for radar, then monitored the tweets of everybody will follow it and then gave you alerts if it thought that that person might be potentially suicidal. But many people felt that their privacy had been violated by this, despite the fact that all the information that was being used was in the public domain. It was things that people had tweeted out for their followers to see in which could be seen by anyone on the World Wide Web. And we became interesting. This isn't much of a broader phenomenon what we describes the phenomenon of privacy in public. So in orderto answer a set of questions about sort of the detection of disease we've discovered, we were digging really deep philosophically into the nature of the rightto privacy adoration of dream privacy and consent, and the article we published. We came to the conclusion that even when people do publish things, they typically have in mind a range of sorts of uses that might be made of that information on a sort of legitimate inferences that might be made from it. And if the information is used in ways that go far beyond that, they may feel that they're right has been violated. We say that we think the right actually has Bean violated. Despite that, the information has Bean published. The articles got quite a lot of traction. People getting to talk about it obviously has very clear implications for some of the ways of dealing that you have in advertising. Perhaps the way that information is used in Facebook and elsewhere. Is there any room for a kind of reflective equilibrium in your approach? Whereas you move between the particular and the more general at from the General to the particular, there's a sense of what you described so far is immersing yourself in the particular. But there must be pre existing plausible premise is plausible generalizations that might come into play as well and feed back the other way. I think that's very definitely the case. I think maybe I've been emphasizing the ground level, the concrete elements, mostly because philosophers tend to do those badly, quite frankly. But yes, I often teach doctors, nurses, people who come to do my courses in the in the hope that it might be have to help them in various ways in their practice, to have thought about some ethical theory of ought to think about. So it's a ethical issues in paternalism, and if all one was ever able to tell people is well, attend to the particulars of the situation and use your judgment, then I think the ethics wouldn't be that useful. Or at least you need so many ethicists, one ethicists per problem almost, and you couldn't get any power that abstraction offers to give us. So I'd like there to be some way of going beyond merely looking at particulars. Andi, I think that principles are very helpful in that. That they're always does need to be that sense of reflective equity. Bring that we can't sort of assume that the principles we have are always going to be correct, and we have to be very much alive to the fact that something might have seen to be a good principle that then you try toe, use it in a more complicated scenario than you initially thought. It turns out that the principal either gives you the wrong result or you realize, in my experience, much more commonly and force. If it turns out that the principal just isn't very helpful. It doesn't really specify what to D'Oh. Or it turns out that the problem is so complicated that you can't really mapped this principle onto it in the first place. How did you get into this style of ethical thinking? Was that something that drew you, particularly to this way of thinking about ethical problems? I think various things true me in this way, something I don't often talk about but that before I did my PhD, In fact, I was thinking of becoming a playwright and one of the reasons I wanted to be a player writers. I think I've always been interested in the texture and the weave of people's lives and the way they experience ethical problems and challenges within those lives. I think there's ways in which you can explore ethical questions within drama, but it's quite difficult to do within philosophy. Sometimes and so that in some of the emphasis that I've tried to place on use of literary examples or in so far as you're going to use thought X men make sure that's rich ones where you can actually imagine the lives of the people that I wanted to find a way of bringing that some of those sorts of ethical insights you can get from drama or from literature back into philosophy.

She had a long relationship with another philosopher, Jean Paul Sartre, that's relevant for how her work has been read. There's a famous line in the second sex. One is not born, but lover becomes a woman. But is that the correct translation? Kate Kirkpatrick has written a biography of Beauvoir on Believes a study of her life can help us interpret her philosophy. Keiko Patrick working to flush three bites Thank you for having me. The topic we're going to talk about is the life and thought of Simone de Beauvoir. Now you've written a biography of Simone de Beauvoir. But you're a philosopher. Why would you be interested in writing their life rather than just looking at the ideas? Well, I started off by being interested in the ideas. And then I discovered that in fact, significant aspects of her life have been neglected by ah lot of philosophers in both the English speaking and French speaking scholarship which have led me to understand the ideas differently. Simone de Beauvoir is very famous, is an existentialist thinker, is a great feminist thinker with a book. The second sex particularly what sort of ways was she misunderstood? Because it seems that she left huge numbers of letters. She left autobiography. She's somebody who is very widely written about in her lifetime, and afterwards, well, the word existentialism plays a significant role here because it was kind of the 19 forties by Gabrielle Marcel to refer to start philosophy, and it was applied quite quickly thereafter, to Bow Boy's novels when in fact, she denied that her novels, especially the blood of others, which came out just after the end of the Second World War, was actually an existentialist novel. So I think there are several cases in both wars life where she's been accused of popularizing starts, ideas or not being critical of search. When she died, Lemons obituary headline said that her work was more popularization than creation. Another claimed that she was as imagination lis as an inkwell and you frequently find the verb applied. Beauvoir applied starts ideas even in the second sex, and I think that there are a lot of reasons to think that is not the case. There is a view of cement above all his work that essentially what she was doing was taking Santa's existential philosophy and applying it in other areas, so particularly in relation to the ways that women become who they are within a culture which has certain expectations that the Monroes that they're expected to play. But your research suggests that that is a complete caricature. Yes, the research goes much farther back than than the 19 forties, when Sergeant Beauvoir both became famous intellectuals and friends. In fact, there's some significant publications that have come out over the past decade and 1/2 and France, which have challenged the traditional narrative about the relationship of barbed wire and sergeant. One of the most significant from the point of view of the philosophical relationship, is her Student diaries, which were published in 2008 and reading those shows that before, before Met Start, she was already interested in the question of what it means to become a self. She was reading philosophers that are well known in the English speaking world, including Nietzsche, who famously said, We should become who we are. But she was also reading less well known French philosophers like Maurice Blondeau, who said that the substance of Manus is action and that any individual is what he makes of himself in an almost verbatim anticipation of what Stark became famous for saying. And existentialism is a humanism as well as Alfred Free a who was a philosopher who worked on freedom and determinism and who disagreed with Jean Jacques Rousseau. So Russo claimed that man is born free but is everywhere in chains and Free A said that one is not born free, but rather becomes it so in French, he wrote on a polyglot, only a deviant. And that is exactly the formulation of the sentence that Boar became famous for in the second Sex when she wrote, One is not born but rather becomes a woman. And so I think when we read the literary illusions that she's making in the second sex, we see that it's not an existentialist question. The questions that Bo was asking are the same questions in the 19 twenties before she met Sarge. How do I become a self? Who will I be? Is that something exists before I act, or do my actions make me who I am? And then when we get to the second sex, the question is, why is it that men are encouraged to have projects outside of love, to have vocations that aren't restricted by biology? And how can we encourage women to see freedom is becoming themselves as a project that's fascinating so that what is often taken to be I saw Tree in has its roots is the early general suggest almost in both wars. Childhood. I mean, she must be very young when she's rushing these diaries because she met Sarge when she's quite young, didn't she? Yes, so she met, such when she was 21. But already before meeting start, she was writing novels or beginnings of novels. One is called on Attempted Existence. There's another where, she says that she wants to chart the discovery of a woman that she is free to choose herself. So before she even meets Search, she's thinking, Why is it that men are enjoying to become themselves to develop projects for their lives? And the same injunctions don't seem to be communicated to women? There's knowing that Simone de Beauvoir was probably conscious. The fuel a formulation of that phrase when she wrote this line about becoming a woman affect how you interpreted. It does affect how I interpret it personally, because I think it fits into her project of wanting women to become free to become themselves into set projects for their lives that aren't constrained by the mythology of being a woman that she rejects. In the second sex, However, that line has had an entire book dedicated to it. It's a much contested line. It's translated in different ways, and the two English translations of the second Sex so partially included. The indefinite article is as one is not born but rather becomes a woman, which emphasizes the particularity of individual women. And the more recent translation does not include the indefinite article that says one is not born but rather becomes woman, as though one's becoming places one in a certain category. Personally, I prefer the previous translation because Bo Boy emphasized the particularity of individual existences and the particularity of individual women being able to pursue their own projects for their lives. So I think their reasons for and against each translation. But her own behavior shows how much she valued individual women and how much she wanted to support them in becoming who they were. What do you mean by that? Her own behavior? Well, it's not widely known that after the 19 fifties, especially when she began to publish her autobiography, she corresponded with her readers in an extraordinary volume. So she set aside an hour a day to write to readers. They're 20,000 letters at the Bibliotheque Nelson on from her readers. In many cases women would write to her saying, I felt so alone. I felt like no one had ever felt like this, dissatisfied with the things that I was supposed to find fulfilling. And there were people who felt unfulfilled by being housewives and mothers. They were aspiring writers, and in some cases she had correspondences that lasted up to 10 years, and she would meet them. She would read their literary works. In some cases, she would promote their careers. She thought that particular women needed to be able to make choices about what their projects were for their lives. So to the extent that she emphasized particularly, I think the A is a good thing in that sentence. Do you think that knowing about the original philosophical source for this packing of the quotation that the rhythms of the sentence and so on, and also knowing about cement above ours assiduous letter responding to particular people, affect how you understand that line? It does because it helps me understand what her project was in writing the second sex. She situated it in a long historical discussion about what it means to be free, and she was dismissing. In fact, starts definition of freedom that he gave him being and nothingness. But her independence of thought before and after meeting Sarge, I think, has been under recognized. So that's part of your project in writing a biography, as I understand it is to give her her appropriate place and acknowledge that she wasn't simply a mouthpiece for Starter. That's a very common view of her philosophy that when she's writing novels, she's doing one thing. But when she's doing philosophy, she's really just part of Team Salt. Yes, it's a view that has been unfortunately promulgated, even by a feminist philosophers. And she's been accused of having an L. Louise complex of being starts disciple and of being content to play this role, even though in many places she explicitly rejects it. And she was critical of Sartre's philosophy in person and in public. At the very least, from 1944 onwards, in 1943 starts being and nothingness was published, which advanced the surgery on account of freedom that sometimes called radical freedom, he said that were condemned to be free because we can't avoid our own freedom, but that freedom is a process of being alienated from ourselves and from others. So Beaufoy agreed that human beings are free in a metaphysical sense. But she thought that search needed to keep a distinction closer to what they cart had between freedom and power, because we can recognize that all humans are free metaphysically. But not all humans have the same power to exercise their freedom. And so in the 19 thirties, she had articulated this objection and conversation using the example of a harem. What good is it to be free if you're kept in some man's harem? So in 1943 she was invited to right her objections to search view of freedom. And she did this in the essay that was published in 1944 Paris and Simeus. So what you're saying is that Senator Bodi was actively criticizing starch and not buying into this radical freedom. The freedom that many people felt and still feel goes far too far. That seems, at times to imply that you can will yourself into anything that if you want to get away from depression by the power of thought, you could just do it. Yes, So she explicitly reject starts, view of freedom and moreover, her criticism was that existentialism did not contain an ethics. And so in a 1945 radio interview, she said that what she was setting out to do in Paris and Sonia's was to provide the ethics of existentialism and was that something different from Santa's approach. At that point, Search didn't have an ethics by the time he starts to write things that look ethical and existentialism is a humanism. Beauvoir has already published Paris and Simeus, and he started to adopt certain aspects of her view to give one example of the idea that existentialism is a humanism. So site was on the record prior to this point for saying that humanism is. I don't know if we say this word on philosophy bites shit. So you're suggesting that by doing biographical research by looking at what cemented over roads and sad and so on, you can see that the direction of inference was often from Santa Barbara, Jean Paul Sartre. You're not always the other direction. Yes, I think it's difficult to say that there's a clearly identifiable direction of influence in all cases, and if you read what their contemporaries wrote about them in the 19 thirties, especially their relationship was one of constant conversation. My project hasn't been to show that starts stole Beauvoir's ideas. Other academics have written books making those sorts of claims, and I think they go too far. But there was a rich philosophical friendship here that generated intense disagreements, and the intense disagreements haven't been recognized because both boys originality has been overlooked. And why do you think her originality has been overlooked? Partly because Paris and Sonia's wasn't translated into English until 2004? There's a kind of a historical way of doing philosophy, which sometimes involves neglecting the texts in their original languages. I think it's partly because she claimed herself. This is very controversial and bothersome. Claim too many feminist philosophers that she was not a philosopher. Sartre was the philosopher, but when she said that she was, I think, actually being critical of such because one of the distinction she makes another places about different types of philosophers is that some our system's philosophers and some are subjectivity, philosophers And to the extent that someone emphasizes a philosophical system, someone like a spinners that or alive knits would never write a novel. For example, But to the extent that someone is interested in the subject, Yvette E. Of an individual person trying to become free and discover what their projects are for their own life, they tend to consider writing in a wider variety of literary forms. She placed herself in the latter category. She doesn't want to be a philosopher whose work isn't relevant to life. She wants philosophy to be something that's lived, and she thinks that literature can facilitate that. In some cases, better than philosophy in the systematic manner can't. So that's interesting as well, because that suggests that when we read a simple translation saying, I'm not a philosopher, we get it wrong because we don't understand the context in which she said that the wider context within which he had these different conceptions of different styles of thinkers. Yes, and I think this is partly something that gets lost in translation between the French philosophical context and the Anglo American context of philosophy. Today, a philosopher in France, like Pascal, can write in multiple literary forms Voltaire right, satire of other philosophers, including Pascal. And so they're multiple forms or genres of philosophical writing in France that are recognized as philosophical, whereas in the English speaking world of philosophy today, the constraints tend to be a bit narrower. Some hardline philosophers will say, Oh, it's all very well to write biographies. It's kind of interesting gossip, but it doesn't really relate to philosophy. Why do we want to know about the life? What we want is to engage with the arguments, the ideas. What would you say to them? I think that case might be easier to defend with some philosophers and others. Take the example of Immanuel Kant. I'm not sure what it benefits us to know. His walking habits and Konigsberg. In the case of Beauvoir, however, her life has been politicized and her philosophy has been dismissed or even unrecognized to the extent of not being seen as worth translating for several decades. So I think, in her case, the very way her life has been politicized Raises philosophical questions. Cates Kirkpatrick. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Is a woman simply an adult female human? Or should we move away from biological definitions and think of being a woman is socially and perhaps even subjectively defined, defined by how people feel? What does that mean for transgender people? The philosopher Kathleen Stock has thought hard about these issues, which have become particularly contentious in the last few years. Kathleen Stock Welcome to Philosophy Bites. Hi. The topic we're talking about today is what is a woman? Sounds an easy enough question. What is a woman? Well, I can tell you what I think a woman is, but perhaps I'd better tell you what the available alternatives are. First on one view that one with the most historical longevity. Ah, woman is an adult human female person on dhe. That's, I think, still, what the word woman refers to for most people and obviously in other languages as equivalent words that we confined pretty easily. So in that sense, it's a person who has a certain biological sex and is an adult, and he's a human. But there are other options to sew. According to some feminist theorists, a woman is to be defined in terms of a certain kind of social role, meaning. Think of the social stereotypes attached to being female, certain kind of expectations about behavior, about mental characteristics, about bodies. Now take that set of social stereotypes and that set of behaviors and characteristics. Ah, woman is somebody to whom those stereotypes in that role applies on a man correspondingly, is somebody who inhabits the associative masculine role, the satya stereotypes associated with illness. If it was defined by roll, then presumably it could change with time as Will's shifted. Yes, absolutely. And on one particular variant of this view, which is that Sally has longer, she thinks that we should change our concept of womanhood. Womanhood should refer Thio, a particularly oppressive set of stereotypes applied thio females or two people who perceived to be females in virtue of their biology on dhe. Once we make this move, she thinks that somehow this is going to be the catalyst for getting rid of the stereotypes so that the endgame for Has Langer is really getting rid of women, which seems like a paradoxical thing toe want, given that meanwhile, woman also, as far as I'm concerned, refers to adult human females. So there seems to be some sort of tension, at least practically in persuading the world's that women need to be got rid off. It's gonna be quite complicated to articulate why that's a good thing. Another definition off woman is identity. A woman is somebody who identifies as an adult human female. Yes, so the way that the dialectic seems to have gone is that we started with adult human female, and that was the traditional idea of womanhood. And then a small sort of academic elite section of people moved to the idea of womanhood as a social role or a set of stereotypes that apply to perceived females. That was, in some ways, scene is quite inclusive because it couldn't includes people who were not biologically female. So biological males who inhabited a feminine social role, who had the set of stereotypes associated with females apply to them could then counters women so that allowed some trans women to countess. Women didn't allow every Trans woman to count the woman because there are trans women where it would be quite hard to make the case that a feminine social role was systematically applied to them. So in order then to be this buzzword inclusive, some philosophers, like Katherine Jenkins, have argued that womanhood should now apply Thio anyone who has the gender identity off a woman, which is nothing to do the social role anymore, at least not directly, because social roles of things over which one has only very limited direct control. You can't really control how the world relates to you, whether it applies stereotypes, femininity to or not. If you move, make the move towards gender identity as determinative of womanhood. Now you've got basically a feeling you seem to have kind of authority over the expression off them, like if you feel it, then who can argue with you? It's a feeling, so there's no other criteria for checking. Whether you really have the feeling than that, you say you do so. That makes it a lot easier for male bodied people who are trans gender thio counters women, and the trans debate is why this has become such a controversial issue over the past few years. But let's get back to a definition which I think you want to hold onto, which has, as a core component, the sex element. One problem with that is that there are people we know who are not easy to categorize into either sex. For various reasons they might be intersects, for example, they might have a Y chromosome. But female genitalia. Yes, so we know more more about, I would say, differences of sexual development rather than calling people into sex, because actually, that's a term that's in dispute within the relevant community itself. But there are obviously quite a large range of differences of sexual development and some of the's no all of them. But some of these are hard cases for ah, traditional view off. What counts is female, and what counts is male. You might, as you say, get people who are chromosomally male inverted commas, but have female genitalia. Or you might have people who have both over and testicular material in their bodies. Now I think the first thing to say is that sometimes a number is floated around in discussions. 1.7% of the population is intersex, and that's just not true. If we're talking about the sort of really difficult cases, it's something like 0.2%. Most of the 1.7% are people who are quite clearly male or female. Many of the females can carry Children to term if they have late onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia. You know that's compatible with carrying a child to term. So in no way does that test the binary. So we're talking about much, much, much smaller percentage of people. But still, of course, we are still talking about them. I think that this knowledge does force us to revise some kind of essential ist account of what sex is. But that's fine, because philosophers have bean revising essential ist accounts off natural kinds for a very long time now, without any kind of panic. So what I think you should have is a cluster concept of biological sex where there's range of characteristics. Most of us have all of thumb for particular sex. Some of us have most of thumb, and a few people have only some of tha MME. But that's fine. That's compatible with realism about sex. That doesn't mean that we should suffer, throw up our hands and say, OK, all bets are off. Anyone could be anything because that's not the case. It doesn't show that sex is a spectrum. No, I mean a spectrum, as I understand it, the distribution. It's got two massive peaks. Most people fall absolutely unambiguously in either male or female. And then there's a few outlying people who are around those peaks. But that's not a spectrum. I mean, there's not sort of continuous gradations between people, but on your view, there were no necessary and sufficient conditions that justify putting one person in one category and somebody else in another category. Correct. But that's not to say that there aren't any characteristics that justify putting one person a category on another person. A different category is just to move away from this rather naive view that in order to be a member of a biological kind, you've got to satisfy some particularly small set individual necessary, enjoying these sufficient conditions. So there's variation in biology is what you'd expect. There's variation in all sorts of ways. Some people are born with more than 10 fingers. Genes mutate all the time. So it's reasonable to think that when it comes to species, there isn't any set of necessary and sufficient conditions that characterizes what it is to be a particular biological species. Now, philosophies of biology are pretty relaxed about that. They don't immediately go Okay, so there's no difference between a lion and a tiger. Just say OK, so there are differences between lions and tigers, but we can account for them without citing essences or necessary insufficient conditions. And what I'm suggesting is that we can do that with female and male to We don't have to panic about the fact that we can't find some single essential feature that all females have into thinking that therefore all bets are off, and now there is no such thing as being female or males could be females or being female is somehow in your head. As a matter of how you identify, that's a crazy inference. Philosophically, this is obviously a fascinating topic, but it has very practical implications. Yeah, there's a lot at stake in this discussion because of its social and legal implications. Now, Trans people feel they have a lot at stake, what many Trans people want is acceptance in society, and that's quite understandable. And they also want to be shielded from the kinds of harm that they characteristically meat in virtue of being discriminated against because they sit awkwardly between these genders worlds so they feel they've got a lot at stake on. Dhe has become popular through trans activism to suggest that the way that, for instance, trans women can become socially accepted and can be protected from these harms is by being treated as women, literally on given access to exactly the same spaces on resources as women are. On the other hand, there are female people natal women here because of the history of misogyny in because of the presence of misogyny in society. Still have, I think, good reason to be worried about a social set up or legal set up, which allows self identification male bodied people self identifying as women to be the criteria of entry into traditionally women only spaces on dhe. Women only resources, women only spaces. You're talking about bathroom changing rooms, things like that. The focus in the media is often bathrooms, but I think we should probably talk more about hostiles, refuges, prisons, on yes, changing rooms, dormitories, particularly spaces where women of lower associate and economic means might be and might not have a choice, they might have to be there. There's now a policy of self i d. As entry into many of these spaces in the UK, and it's had demonstrably effects on certain women. And there's fears that were the policy to become more mainstream or entrenched, well known about that there would be a continuation of these problems. And by self I D you mean people are allowed to just identify as one sex or another. And what that alone is enough to get them into these spaces? Yes. So I'm talking about institutions who have formally adopt policies which say that anyone who identifies as a woman can be in a woman only space. They don't need to have got illegal sex change they don't need don't demonstrate anything. It's very unlikely that anyone's gonna ask them if in institution does have that sort of policy. So there's a sleeper coach that goes from Fort William to London, and it has shared bunks. If you want to save some money, you end up in a shared bunk they've made it a formal policy that trans women or anyone who says I am a woman could be in one of those bunks with other women. That's just one example. There's quite a few others if you take the possibility of male violence against women seriously. And that isn't to say that trans women a particularly dangerous at all is just to say that there is a reason that we had sex separated spaces in the first place, especially in sleeping areas and changing areas. If you take that seriously, then you I got to ask, what will be the effects off making self I d. The criterion of entry. So the concern is male violence in these spaces, somebody might say, Well, there's probably a tiny, tiny percentage off trends women who might pose a threat in that way. Is this really a good reason to exclude everyone else? Well, there's a tiny percentage of males that commit violence relative to the male population released. I don't know if that's even true, but they say that that's true. Is that a good reason to have sex separated spaces? We have assumed up till now that there is a good reason to have sex separated spaces. What is that reason when it's clearly not that all males of island, it is that some males of violent some males sexually assault women. Some males have sinister reasons to be in areas where female sleep will get undressed. Voyeurism flashing sexual assault. This is not the claim that all or most trans women of island it is absolutely not. It is the claim that if you change the social structure on make, males who say they're women make it legitimate that they could be in a woman only space you will not be able to keep only the good people in on. Women will no longer be able to challenge anyone on the grounds of appearance. And you already see that, actually, because in the UK, we've now in many changing rooms, especially on campuses. We've got these signs in the bathroom that say, If you see someone that doesn't look right in this bathroom, that looks like they don't match your understanding of who should be in his bathroom, keep it to yourself, don't trust your instincts, trust them. They know where they should be. Now that's a great utopian idealistic thing to say. But in the actual context we're in, where we have the levels of sexual assault that we do on the physical power differentials we have between male bodies on female bodies, it is no acceptable to tell females that they need to trust male bodied people in spaces where they sleep or get undressed. Tell me why. This is not analogy. It's supposed. There was one racial group that had a much higher crime rate than another with the racial group, with the lower crime rate be justified in being concerned about bringing in members of the racial group with the higher crime rate. That question is not directly analogy. Ists. Arguably, white people are very dangerous to black people. They're also they tend to talk louder, take up more space. They have more social power on. There might be very good reasons for black people to have their own spaces without white people being there. So that's what I think about that particular scenario. Now, obviously, the question what is usually posed? I'm not supposed to go that way, am I? I'm supposed to say, Ah, you must be talking about black people and how dangerous they are. And then you basically trying to force me or someone like me into a position where I end up either having to bite the bullet and say yes. In that case, why people should be protect from black people or reject my own position about males and females. But I think that's kind of an unfair move. Because the history of male female relationships, the male nor all males males have exploited females. Males have oppressed females. They have extracted their reproductive labor. They have ensured that they didn't get jobs or the vote. They have made them the bearer off multiple kinds of violence. Now, if you're gonna make an analogy between different racial groups, then females should be relevantly compared to the oppressed racial group rather than the oppressor. Does it matter to you whether people in the trends community have bean through any kind of surgical process? Would that make a difference to how you thought about these segregated spaces? Well, I think it makes a practical difference in the following way. If you're a Trans woman who has made a serious commitment to medical surgical transition. If you have taken hormones for years, if you have had over jump lusty. There are many trans women who, what school past. There's no way the average person could tell that they weren't female people, so I have no problem with people. In that context. Being in female space is partly because I don't see how we could possibly stop them. I mean, we don't thank God you do any kind of checks on the way in That would sort that question out. So that's just seems to me like, pointless to worry about. Transsexuals have been using female facilities for a long time, and they will continue to do so. But that's not what we're talking about these days. Trans activism has insisted that the transgender umbrella, as they call it, be extended to include people who have had absolutely no bodily modification. They have male genitalia. They haven't taken hormones. They don't even necessarily have to dress any particular way. They might have beard, but if they say they're a woman than there a woman on then therefore they have access to all the legal and social resources on protections that were originally intended to be extended. Only two adult human females and empirically Do we have any idea how many among the trans community have undergone some kind of surgical procedure? Well, it's hard to get exact figures. But on a 2015 transgender survey, which was run by the National Center for Transgender Equality, they had 27,000 respondents now that included transmit trans women and non binary people. But 12% of that number had had, uh, vagina pastie, or labia, plus de the numbers off. People who have had some kind of surgery will be higher because surgery in this area might include facial feminization surgery. It might include a tricky ll shave. It might inclusion or get me. It might include breast implants, so there's lots of different surgeries you can have. But the sort of full transition, it seems, is still something that only a relatively small percentage of people who are trans, have had or even want have. Although I think there are many who want to have it but can't have it because it's quite expensive and there's waiting this and your insurance might not cover it and things like that. What are the implications of this for sexuality? Well, that's good question, because many trans women are female, attracted before transition, you would have called, um, heterosexual males. They transition, but their sexual orientation towards female people remains. That creates a sort of superficially anyway. I think a problem in how a trans woman who's female attracted self describes. Obviously, you don't want to say they're heterosexual for going out with a woman. So many Trans women call themselves lesbians now. More importantly, as far as I'm concerned, the major LGBT organizations and charities and even lesbian magazines and lesbian societies agree with them who bet lesbians. So these resources, that again sort of a parallel situation to the wider situation with females. They have bean special resources and special spaces that traditionally have bean put aside for lesbians, as in female homosexuals, which are now open to self identifying male body people who self identify both as women and as lesbians. And that creates its own social problems in additions. The ones we've already mentioned, the one I am most worried about is the effect on emerging young female homosexuals who, discovering their sexuality, they're trying to make sense of the world's a heteronormative culture that they're born into usually anyway on they often could be in queer communities with trans women who say they're lesbians. On dhe, there is a sort of increasing social tendency, very noticeable online, but also in lesbian publications. You will find articles about how lesbians that his female homosexuals can have sex with trans women. Now we've already discussed the fact that relatively few Trans women have changed that genitalia. So in other words, on the face of it, female homosexuals are experiencing social pressure to have sex with people with penises when they're lesbians. That's the whole point hold. The finding orientation was supposed to be that they didn't want to have sex with penises. And now they're in a situation where there is some social expectation in some queer circles that they should at least be open to the possibility of having sex with trans women because they, too, are lesbians like them. And I think that's a very confused and confusing situation to put young people in. Is there real evidence that this is happening, that people are becoming confused about this, that it is causing all sorts of the anxieties intentions amongst adolescence? Yes, you just need to look a TTE discussion forums read it. You need thio. Look at the emerging number of testimonies of Article de transicion. Er's usually women who have for awhile identified his transmitter have bean in a very progressive queer communities, and we'll talk about what they've seen in those communities. But it also just doesn't take March toe. Anticipate that this would be a case if you start from a position of thinking off mail people who are socialized as males, at least developmentally in developmental stages, and you take seriously the idea that they will usually be taken more seriously. Talk louder. Be listened. Thio. Be more pushy. You know these aerial generalizations with exceptions, of course, but nonetheless, we seem perfectly happy. Is this progressive society to endorse these generalizations when it comes to six people? This just doesn't seem much reason to think that in queer communities, the same dynamics, the same misogyny, possibly homophobe or even might also be playing out there in ways which harm the people of the least power. The people at least power if we're just looking at sex based dynamics and sexual orientation based dynamics are lesbians. There are lots of fascinating areas of philosophy, and this is one of them, But there's probably no other area of philosophy where the debate is so angry, so polarized. Yes, I think that's true. It's really strange. There's been an enormous effort from within philosophy to shut this discussion down on Dhe. I'm and others who have decided to wade in have experienced a lot of criticism. As a philosopher, you assume that people will attack your arguments and that they will attack them, sort of responsibly, and they will try to get you right. They will reconstruct you in charitable ways in order to criticize you. But they won't just produce a riel caricature of what you think and then laugh atyou for it. Or they won't tell you that you're a terrible bigot for even raising this question on. Yet in this area, that's what happens. One interesting dynamic is that people who regard themselves as progressive don't really know which site to support as it were, because here you have embattled communities on both sides. Yes, that seems so, although I must admit I have increasingly little sympathy for people that can't work out that there are genuine interests at stake on both sides. I think if your progressivism is relatively superficial and your aim is ultimately thio side with whoever is the most depressed without being prepared to look into the actual complicated material facts about the forms of the oppression and how their experience socially, legally, politically, then you might well be confused by this debate. But it's no actually that confusing. I mean, really, we just need to stop fighting over a single word on a single concept and develop a richer set of concepts which then can be put into law and put into social policy in a way that's compatible with the rights and interests of the other group. Given what's at stake, people's sense of themselves, people's very identity. How important is it to get the tone of the philosophical debate, right? Well, I mean, people are going to say that I haven't succeeded in this whatever I say, but I think it's important to be respectful. It's important to keep insisting that trans women and females both deserve lives free or violence free of exploitation, free of discrimination and free of fear. On that, we need to put in social arrangements that can accomplish both of those things where I feel there's an expectation on me, which is unreasonable is that I often feel that as a woman, I'm expected to be excessively kind on excessively nice on Dhe. I actually think that that's part of the problem. It's got us where we are that there's been this sort of weird, highly genders stereotype that feminist philosophers have apparently uncritically accepted that it is their role to manipulate the concept of woman until we can get everyone who wants to be in it in it, without thinking through what the material consequences that this might be for the people that were already occupants of the category. So I think we should be respectful, but we should also be sometimes quite forthright. We should constantly be pointing out that there are two sets of interests and two sets of in their lives. Here. You hear an awful lot about the Trans woman who is very frightened to go into a male bathroom. But you hear practically nothing about the rape survivor who faces Ah world in many social institutions now where she has to go into a bathroom and share it with males. What does that do to her now? If people don't care about that, they should come out and say it. But what annoys me is, um, people pay lip service to caring about women and survivors of sexual violence. They talk about me, too, and then in the same breath they say you are. But what are they worried about? There's no problem here. You know you can't have it both ways. It's unusual to have to take abuse for taking a particular philosophical position. What's not being like for you? UM, is being hard. At times, it's bean challenging on dhe isolating, especially the beginning, because I wasn't used to it. And also I didn't have that many allies or didn't feel like I did. Where is now? I've developed a network of people that support me, and that helped me out. So yes, it's being personally isolating. It was being very dispiriting. I have, I have to say, lost a lot of respect for academic philosophy. It's just really hard Thio understand how philosophers who took a very good game, who will give you an opinion on absolutely anything can certainly go absolutely silent when it comes to a really important metaphysical issue that has practical ramifications. What was all that training for? You've taken a very strong stand. Has it been worth it? Yes, it's been absolutely worth it for a start. I'm not biting my tongue off. That did go through a time where I was furious and felt like I couldn't say anything because I feared the social consequences. Now I faced social consequences. I feel released. I can say what I think. I've met some amazing new people, has amazing experiences. You know, I've talked to the House of Lords. I've written for the Economist of done all sorts of exciting things and I've got more coming up. So I think it's being great. Aside from the personal sense of satisfaction, I get out of it. It's obviously I'm doing it because I think it's important. I think it's important in a way that's much wider than me. Kathleen Stock. Thank you very much indeed. Thanks very much. Enjoyed it.

There's a gap, a character gap Christian Miller calls it between what we are and what we aspire to be. Christa Miller. Welcome to frustrate Bites. Thank you so much for having me on the topic we're going to discuss is the character gap. Now, before we get into the character gap, could you just say something about what character is? Character is a very broad notion, and I want to make it clear that in my work I'm focusing specifically on moral character. I think of moral character as our moral fiber, how we are disposed to think, feel and act when it comes to moral matters. And it comes in two main varieties. There are moral virtues there, more vices. On the one hand, there are virtues like honesty, temperance and courage. And on the other hand, there are vices like dishonesty and cowardice. So what you're saying is that character is a pattern of behavior that somebody displays, so that if I'm a onliest person, if my character is fundamentally honest, I don't tend to tell lies. They tell the truth. That's part of it. That is a central part, but not all of it. So, on my way of thinking about character, it's both psychological and behavioral. So nice person does honest things in the world. They tell the truth. For example, they keep their promises. They don't lie, cheat or steal. But in addition underlying that they haven't honest psychology, honest way of thinking about the world, for example, they are motivated in a certain way. They're not motivated by their own self interest, but they're motivated for entrance by a concern for the truth. So character in general involves both psychological aspects as well as behavioral aspects. That's really interesting. So how would that be evident independently of behavior? I mean, an honest person. Somebody does on this stuff, but an honest person from a psychological point of view, that's a kind of internal aspect, possibly something that they can reflect on what other people may have no access to. That's correct. So it's one thing. To be honest, it's another thing for us to be able to tell whether someone is honest and so in order. To be honest, I think you have to have both this psychological component and its behavioral component for us, though as observers, we only really have access to people's behavior. So the best that we can do normally is look at someone's behavior and try to infer or reason back to what was their underlying motivation or psychology like, but that's a very fallible process. We can often make mistakes. We could be confused or deceived about what is motivating someone. But it's important to see how people behave not only in normal instances but also in unusual situations, situations where they're not comfortable with it. We're not familiar to them, and that's often very illuminated of what they're lying motivations like now there's a long tradition in philosophy of focusing on character, particularly if you go back to Aristotle. This is at the heart of what it is to be moral or ethical. It is to have certain virtues, certain patterns of behavior, which are, to a certain extent, formed by our upbringing. Is that what you found in your examination of psychological research on character? So there is good evidence from psychology for the existence of character. The character traits are real. They exist. They're important, both causally and explain totally to behavior. But there are a lot more complicated than we might have initially thought. It doesn't often help to explain behavior. To use simple categories like honest or dishonest, with a psychological research instead shows to me is that we have what I call a mixed character character, which has some aspects which are morally positive. Some aspects which are morally negative. There'll be situations in which someone will be motivated to tell the truth in other situations, which will be motivated to tell the lie. And those situations might very small amounts based on what's going on the person situation. So, yes, character Israel. It's important, but it's a lot more complicated than we might have initially thought. Could you give a specific example of that really life example of the complexity of character? Sure, so we've been talking a lot about honesty, so let me stick with that example. There has been a recent approach to thinking about cheating in the psychology ledger, which involves the following paradigm. You put people in a situation where they take a test, their 20 problems. They're going to pay 50 cents U S per correct answer. In the control situation, there's no opportunity to cheated all they take the test, they turn their answers. The person in charge grades their answer sheets. In one version of this experiment, they get about seven right on average. In another variation. No, which is called the shredder condition. They have the opportunity to grade their answers afterwards and then just reports how many they got correct, shredding all their materials in the process. So the idea is that they know that they can say whatever answer they wants and be paid accordingly, no questions asked. Well, in this kind of situation, on average, in this one variation of the experiment, I'm thinking of about 14 Answers and quotation marks were reported, so seven in that control 14 in the experiment version. With the shredder condition so far, up to this point, it's kind of a bleak picture. It's evidence of widespread shooting, I think it's fair to say, but there's another variation where first the participants were put in an honor code environment. In other words, they were asked to sign their university's honor code, pledging their honor that they were not sheets. Then they were given the test shredder condition. Once again, you could report whatever you wanted to. Lo and behold, cheating was eliminated. The answers on average went back down to seven. That's really interesting. That actually sounds very similar. Thio a thought experiment in Plato's Republic, The Ring of Maggie's. This ring that makes you invisible on the claim is that if you have one of these rings, you're not going to be motivated to be more a little because you can always slip the ring on and disappear, And that seems to be corroborated by the evidence in the first instance. But the second aspect of that research suggested that there are ways in which you can make people behave morally. That's correct. I would have also thought that there would be lots of evidence that if no one's looking and you could get away with it, you're just going to cheat or steal whatever the case might be. What this research suggests is that our motivation and our psychological lives is more complicated than that. The current explanatory hypothesis is that we often do want to cheat, for instance. But we also want to think of ourselves as honest people. It was not just, I want to shoot whatever I can get away with it and get as much for myself as I can. I also really do want to think of myself as an honest person, and it's going to be very hard for me to think of myself as honest person. If I've just signed an honor code and then turn around and cheese. So in that kind of situation, when I have the more reminder that makes moral consideration salient in my mind and importance of thinking myself is honest person is thereby much harder to then act like the shepherd in the ring of guy. Jeez, example. In that example, the shepherd finds this ring puts the ring on twist a certain way. It makes him invisible. And then he has this power. We could do whatever he wants for good or for ill. And in Plato's rendition of it, the shepherd chooses to kill the king, sleep with the clean and take over the kingdom. But what this contemporary research suggests is that that's not necessarily going to be the case. Couldn't you draw a different conclusion from some of that research? Namely, that we don't really have anything that is worthy of the name character? Actually, what we are our beings with particular histories who react strongly to environmental factors, which we may be scarcely aware of, are not aware of a tool and that the idea that we have fixed characters should be something we should be skeptical about. That's an idea that's been around both in philosophy and psychology for sometimes. So going back to 19 sixties, there was this situation ist movement in psychology, led by a psychologist named Multi Michelle. And for a time that idea was very prominent to the extent to which people were just discarding the idea of what was called global character or stable character across situationally consistent character altogether in psychology. Though that idea didn't last in the seventies and eighties, it was put to one side and in philosophy. This idea was picked up on in recent years by certain philosophers like John Doe, Orson Gilbert Harmon, but again has not found widespread support. Here's why. It's too extreme to say that behavior is just a product of external situational forces. What's going on, has said, is that there is an interaction at work between our situation, environment on the one hands and internal features of our psychology. So I signed the honor code is a result of being in a situation that's triggers in my mind, certain psychological values and desires and hopes and the like of that's which then cumulatively give rise to behavior. And it's not just a one off behavior or random behavior, it is actually predictable. It's also cross situationally consistent. So the idea is people want to cheat in a variety of situations, which they think they can get away with shooting. And it's to there self benefits. But I also want to think of themselves as honest people in a variety of situations. So it's not just when they taking this test and you have this chance to earn 50 cents per correct answer that you're motivated cheats. But then the honor code would hinder that. It said enough white of right of situations where it's disposed in this way both want to cheat, but also to think of ourselves as people and this generalizes now beyond just matters of cheating as well. We see this in the area of helping we see a scenario of harming. We see this an area of lying, and so for stealing, where you see consistent patterns of behavior across a variety of situations, patterns which are best explained by under US lying psychological motivations and dispositions, but which ultimately are not virtuous psychological dispositions and motivations which are instead, I think, best understood as mixed character traits. You've bean speaking about virtues and vices, as if it's obvious what they are. But if you just took honesty, it's not obvious to me that absolutely scripless honestly and walk situations is a virtue. It seems to me it's a way of protecting your own purity, perhaps purity of psychology, purity of intention, but often at the expense of others. That's right, and I have been speaking that way in my own thinking about this. I want to hone in on rather un controversial examples of honesty, compassion and other virtues rather than getting into more controversial cases, say, of humility versus pride or chastity or some other things like that. There's controversy about just what the list of virtues is in in the first census, and I tended to want to start with the relatively on controversial once. But that's not all that you were thinking of there. There's another part of it, too. So let's take honesty. We agree that honesty's a virtue, but then they're different accounts of honesty, different analyses of honesty, and that's a matter of controversy to So my approach here again is to try and pick on clear instances where there's going to be wide agreement that this is honest or this is dishonest. So in the research where there's a chance to cheat or not on the test, there's not gonna be much controversy that this person who cheated on the test was doing something dishonest. Having said that, yes has a general matter. The virtue of honesty needs a lot more conception. Packing on my own accounts, I think of honesty as a disposition to reliably not intentionally distort the facts. So you're committed to reporting the facts the way they are released, the way you think they are. So I do think of honesty as involving willingness to tell the truth as you think of the truth and so forth. But I also acknowledge that there are other competing considerations in life that are important, too. So honestly isn't the only thing to life. There's only thing number out, either. It's not even the only thing to character side by side with honesty, we need to keep in mind compassion, so they would be situations in life where honesty might tell me, tell the truth. But compassion might tell, may tell a lie. For example, if I'm hiding Jews in my basement and the Nazis air coming to look for the Jews. We've called this episode of Lassie Bites the character gap. We've talked a lot about character, but what is the gap? Yes, so the gap is the space between our actual character and the character we should have in my research. I both used philosophy and psychology at the same time. Philosophy helps me think about what kind of character we should have. That's a virtuous character, and I asked Karen to compassion, character and the like. That's psychology helps me understand what kind of character we actually have. How we doing these days? What is a pattern of behavior that most people exhibit look like? So when I combine those two disciplines and the results from each, what I find is that there is a significant gap conceptually and empirically between how we actually are and how we should be. That's the character gap. Could you give an example of that? Sure, So we've talked a lot about honesty. Let's shift over to another example, say compassion. So I think compassion is a virtue. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it involves, but it at least involves helping others, especially in cases of obvious need. Well, here's a study now switching from the philosophy to the psychology from the 19 sixties, a very famous study called The Lady in Distress. Example. You come into a situation where you're asked to fill out a survey. You go into this room, sit down, start working on the paperwork. A stranger comes in. You don't know is filling out the survey as well. Save table with you. The person in charge leaves goes in the next room. A few minutes later, your large crash, this person is suddenly screaming and yelling at my leg. My leg sounds like a bookshelf has fallen over a share. She's in pain. Will you help or not? Ordinarily, we would predict that people would help and I would put it. But I would help. But it really depends on situational factors in this case, whether the stranger you're with shows any signs of helping or not, the stranger you're with continues to work on the survey and does nothing. It's very likely you'll do nothing as well. In the particular study, only 7% of participants did anything to help that person in the next room who was screaming in pain as opposed to a different variation where the participants were alone. In that case, 70% helped. So 70 versus 7%. Now, what's the implication? That well, that doesn't seem to me to reflect a good side to our character. I'm not saying that we're vicious or that were cruel or callous, but this is not what I would expect of a compassion person. I would expect a compassionate person to be able to discern what's most morally civilians in the situation rise to the occasion, at least offer some help because that's one instance of an example of the character gap. Now this is a widespread phenomenon, and there's been a lot of empirical evidence is corroborated this way in which other people are environment. Things were semi conscious of all scarcely conscious or not conscious of a tool shaped what we actually do almost in the teeth of what we think of ourselves as like, is there anything we can do about this? We just stuck with this Well, if we just ended the conversation here, I think we should be discouraged. And we have this character gap. Sorry, let's go home and nothing you could do about it. But there's a reason for optimism and hope. I think there comes from psychology, some evidence, first of all, the characters malleable. So whatever character we have now we're not stuck with is not fixed. We can change it not dramatically overnight, typically, but gradually, slowly over time, and secondly, that there are some actual concrete strategies for doing so. So me briefly mentioned, too, one is positive role models. So there's some evidence that identifying, admiring and in seeking to emulate positive role models can have a good impact on one's own character. Where these are fictional role models with these historical role models, where these are everyday moral models in your own personal life, for example, a neighbor or a family member who's a paradigm of honesty, who you admire for their honesty, and then you want to become more like them, your character is elevated or you want to emulate their character in your own life. That is one promising strategy for improving character on what was the second way of improving a moral character. So the second idea is to use more reminders in your life in the psychological research, some examples of that have been sighing. The honor code, which then has been found to prevent cheating from happening or, in another version, give participants the 10 Commandments ask him to recalls May the 10 Commandments as they can. And that's also been found to prevent cheating. The general idea here is that more reminders can tune us to what's morally stallions and keep our perspective where it needs to be. There's so many other factors that come into our lives that can distract us, especially considerations of self interest that if we have regular more reminders our lives, things like text messages, which we program on our phones or reading that we have every day or something that we hang up in our office. That can be a way to regularly repeatedly remind us and thereby strength and over time, our focus in our perspective on what's really important, morally speaking. Now you've studied character in depth for over a decade. How has that changed your own approach to your own character? That's it. That's a great question. Two really important things jump to mind right away. One is, it's made me appreciate the fact that my character is much more of a mixed bag and much more complicated than I initially thought. I didn't think I was a very good person to begin with, but I didn't really appreciate the subtleties and the complexities and the ways in which there are factors at work, guiding my behavior that I wasn't even paying attention to wasn't even aware off, for example, how much what other people are doing impacts, whether I will help or not. If other people are not helping, it's very likely I will not help. I didn't realize that before I got into some of the psychological research. And so I've learned a whole bunch more about my own character and then also in the process, tried to improve my character as well. The other factor is that I now have Children, three Children, their 64 and two, and it's really having worked on character, impressed upon me the importance of trying to be a good role model of character to my Children because I've seen how character can be caught and morality can be caught and wool models can be influential and for the good or for the bad, and my Children are so important to me, obviously, and their characters at this stage in our lives are so malleable and fluid that I really want to pay attention to character now only for my sake, but for the sake of my Children as well.

But when did humans first not using ethical talk? And how did they serve eyes? Philip Pettitt has a story, a useful story, he says, even if it's not true. Philipp Etter. Welcome to flush three bites. Thank you very much. The topic. We're going to focus on is the birth of ethics. Now, before we get onto the birth, perhaps we could just clarify more. Is ethics Well, well, I'm thinking of ethics is the best thing going trusted with his just altruistic behavior. It's more than altruistic behavior. I mean, animals of all kinds display altruistic behavior. We now have many evolutionary explanations of that. But when you got ethics, certainly people removed by ethics on behaving good, part of many contexts in altruistic way. But there's only ethics at the origin of that behavior when they've got concepts of inappropriate kind that air regulating the behavior that are accessible to them like they think they ought to. They think that this is what's valuable to think, that this is what's right, and they think that they will be blameworthy, for example, for not acting in that way. It's when you got those concepts that are driving and regulating the behavior and the relatively altruists we have. It's only then that you've got ethics in the sense I think about it. So a chimpanzee might care for another member of its family in an altruistic way, possibly. But that wouldn't be unethical concern because it can't conceptualize what it's doing. I was saying a case like that. The animal is behaving ethically if you wish, but it's not thinking in unethical manner. And ethics is present only when you've got both ethical thinking and consequently ethical behavior. So does that mean it records language? That's what I believe myself, because I think that it's hard to explain how we could ever have developed are how any creatures could ever develop the ethical language of the valuable, the responsible and so on unless they already had language in some form available to them. I think of it as a development that will come on stream in the wake of language and in the story that I want to tell about how ethics might have been born. It's very important that there's language there in the first place. It's interesting you describe it is a story because I know that it's not meant to be true necessarily your story of the birth of ethics. No, because counterfactual stories are often extremely illuminating, and what I want to tell is a contra factual story about the birth of ethics. So perhaps you could explain what a counterfactual story is, first of all, probably the best way to do that is to remind you of something that actually know flirt A peeler wear off, which is from economics. Wanna one, so to speak. You ask what his money and economists for now well over 100 years say, if you want to know, money is imagine And now they tell a counterfactual story. Imagine a society where people operated with barter alone. Imagine the difficulties they would have had. I, for example, I'm involved in making furniture. You're involved in producing potatoes. I want potatoes, but you don't want furniture, so I can't give you with the furniture I can't even give you. And I owe you in furniture because you don't think you'll ever want furniture. I've got to go and find somebody who's willing to give me potatoes for the furniture. I can fry them with the standard economic story, then explains how enormous Denny circumstance as some commodity would emerge as a commodity that a lot of people want. And then it becomes common knowledge that a lot of people want it. For example, think of cigarettes in post World War to Berlin are. Think if you like of gold, as it may have been at some stage in human history. And once people believes that a north lot of people want this commodity, they're going to want to have that commodity because if they have it, they can trade with it. And of course you can. Also, if there then reliable Goldsmiths, for example, sources of cigarettes you can get I. O. U's issued, you can get something happening, like Golden Privilege Commodity being passed around a lot serving this purpose, r I. O U's and Gold. And then, as economists say, Now, look, would we call that gold and those gold I use money And you think, Well, I guess we would. And then this suggestion is, Wait a moment. That's just what we mean by money. It's a commodity that actually serve the same role in our society as the imaginary gold serves in. That society is not a good candidate for money means. So now I've got an understanding of money, and that was all generated on the basis of an as if history, a contra factual story. And it's very striking that many historians are money now argue they're never wasa pure barter society. But that story is still illuminating about the nature of money. If you had the choice of telling the actual story of how ethics emerged or a counterfactual one, which would be the better story to tell Well, of course, be wonderful. If we did have a totally convincing actual story about the origin of ethics. I mean, the rug very good accounts in the evolution literature. Very imaginative. They're all speculative. Of course, the one I probably know best. And I think very well off is the account that Michael Thomas L. A. For example, the evolutionary psychologists offers in a recent book. But those are very speculative. But the sort of illumination that I look for from a counterfactual story is not provided necessarily by that sort of actual history of he might actually come across. Some signs that we interpret as they were expressing a notion of auto are a valuable, you know, back then, in maybe 20,000 years, of all whatever, it wouldn't tell you anything really about the nature of ethics, whereas a counterfactual story that suitably designed may well give you that sort of sense of the nature and the role of ethics. Okay, so what is your story of the emergence of ethics? What is the story that best illuminates what ethics is? Well, let's see, in order to sort of give a sense of what I think needs to be done, let's distinguish between value concepts, concepts to do with what you want to do, what's right to do what you're obliged to do, what would be wrong not to do. And so on. On the one hand value concepts and on the other concepts you might call responsibility concepts, as in he or she was responsible for doing this. They're blameworthy for doing it. They're commendable for not doing it or whatever. They're suitable objects of resentment or indignation. Call those the responsibility concept. So what I want is a an as if story, a counterfactual jenny allergy that will give us a sense of how people might have evolved both value concepts and responsibility concepts and at the same time, the corresponding practices. So that that will then give us a candidate for how we get to think about talk about the valuable and the responsible. So what are other crucial elements of this story? Oh, dear. Well, let's see. So in the story, I tell Ground zero, As you might say, where the story begins, like the barter society in the money case is a society, I imagine, in which people exactly like us otherwise have got language. But they use this language holy to give information to one another. I tell you where the fissure running and you tell me where you found the ripening fruit or whatever it might be. As the story develops, I argue that people are going to have an interest in establishing their credibility. That's really going to be very important, you know, communicated with somebody else. There's one thing they can do to establish the credibility. They can make it expensive, so to speak, to communicate their attitudes. So, for example, you want to know, Does Jones Is he trustworthy? Does he really want peaceful relationship with us on? I say, Yes, he does desire that, and it turns out that he doesn't behave as you would expect if he had that desire. And you come to me to complain, Well, I can get off the hook, so to speak, claimed that I'm still a truth teller still expect your alliance for me by saying Well, either two things, obviously. One is that well, you know, I must have misheard or misunderstood his intentions. You know, the evidence must have been this. Leading are the other thing. I'm essay Is that you know he changed. He changed his mind about things like that since I spoke to you. So there's the misleading mind and the change mind excuse that I can use to get off the hook So my words are fairly cheap. When I told you about Jones, one thing we're going to be interested in in my ground zero society I want to make myself credible in this society. It be nice if I could, for example, convey or communicate the desires. I have safer piece of relationship with you in such a way that I couldn't get off the hook so easily. Because then my words would be more expensive, right? Well, there is one way I could do it. So, for example, instead of saying, yeah, I think I desire, you know, that this piece and so on, thinking about myself, like about another person, I might say something like pieces. Great. Expressing so to speak. The desire if I do that to convey the desire and I dont later displayed that desire and you complain to me, I can't say she must have gotten that desire wrong because I made up the desire, you know, in expressing it, I didn't just scan my mind to find a had that desire. I made up my mind to desire that when I said You pieces great, let's have peace. That means it's a more expensive way of communicating my desire because I can't get off the hook so easily as a quid in reporting on another person. I didn't quite understand why that's more expensive. Is it because there are consequences for me if I get it wrong? Yes. After all, the background assumption and I tried to defend that is that we care about a reputation with the other, you know, as being someone lied because although as you want people to rely on us and we can't communicate, we can't cooperate with them and what I'm doing in conveying the desire in that way where I can't get off the hook by saying I was mistaken about my mind, I stake my reputation on actually proving to be a peace lover. If I don't prove to be that, then I may claim Well, you know, I changed my mind since then. I used to be a piece of American use that x six Maybe, but I certainly countries excuse. I must have gotten myself wrong. So in that way it's more costly than if I'm wrong about 1/3 person. I understand that now. Have you got to ethics at that point? Or is that just a sense in which I've got some flesh in the game? No. I mean there are many stages, as there is in the money story. Am I simplify the money story so that simplify this. The thought I have is the following that once were each making ourselves more credible to the other by avowing. Let's call it our desires on where are vowing. I mean, we can't get off by saying we got ourselves wrong. No misleading mind excuse. When we get to avowing desires like that, we immediately confront the following possibility that we have vowed range of desires like for peace with other people, for truth telling for prom, escaping and so on and hey, we're in a situation where I really want to hit this guy, you know? Or I really don't want to tell the truth about this. It's so embarrassing. While I really don't want to keep that promise, we're going to find ourselves suddenly sort of schizoid between. On the one hand, we judge something to be It's what I have vowed, a desire far right on what my reputation is invested in its who I said I am. You can rely on me to be like that, and on the other hand, we have the self who is actually attracted to not be peaceful, to punch someone in the eye to tell a lie and so on. And so you open up that sort of division within the self between what's desired and what's valued. And I think that's the first moment of where the idea of ethics appeared. What also appears at that point is that to go with what's desired, actually but not valued when those divergence do occur is a sort of failure because after all, now you didn't live up to the south that you projected so to speak and vice it. Other people to rely on. So there's a sort of failure involved in going with what's just contingency desired rather than what you're vowed as to be desired on what you might call as value. Let's introduce that now. So the idea is that these creatures were positioned to use a word like valuable for the things they had vowed desires, far where they staked the reputation in. And now you got the notion of the valuable appearing that might give you a sense, at least of how I think the Jenny Allergy might go at that point on, with respect to the valuable concepts, it strikes me in the way you've told that story, that this is very much a social issue. It's not an individual coming to a conclusion in isolation, but it's all about how you're perceived whether you follow through on the values that you have. Our absolutely. We all have been attracted in the past by the idea of developing as it were, a Cartesian theory of ethics, you know, just finding in ourselves like resources like the requirement of being rational agent, whereby you congrats morality onto that. So if you're going to be properly rational, you've got to be moral. I think, actually that morality comes in in the wake of social life, not just in the wake off personal individual morality and that becomes actually even Maur salient to me when you move from the valuable concepts to the responsible concepts, the responsibility concepts. So perhaps you could say just a little bit about the responsibility concepts. Then when How do we get a notion of responsibility? Well, and this really isn't buying the story of a lot where I associate value concepts with avowed desire. So they're vowed, Lee desired becomes the valuable and contrast with the actually desired. I associate a responsibility concepts without Michael pledges rather than desires now within a vowel. I said that you closed on one excuse the misleading mind excuse for getting off the hook when you prove not to live up to the attitude you communicated. But there's a further sort of speech act. Call it, pledging where not only do I close down the excuse must have gotten my mind wrong, but I also closed down the excuse. I changed my mind. So if I pledge, for example, to meet you tonight at the football match er of the theater. Whatever. And I don't turn up. I can't excuse yourself by saying what must have got myself wrong when I said I will be at the match, right? But neither. If it's clear that I pledged by conventions, neither is gonna be. Is that well? I changed my mind. You're going to say you change him? Aren't you pledged? You know, our promised. How could you? So you shut down both excuses. So that's a really expensive speech Check so to speak. Your reputation is very highly invested in that staked in that. Okay, so I think that if we're creatures now who make pledges to another that kind, then we're creatures who know our assume in survives. We accept those pages that we care about how we stand with the other care about their reputation. But that means any one of us can now exhort the other to behave in a certain way. So, for example, you made a promise to 1/3 person, and you have confessed to me that you weren't trying to break it. And I can say to you you made a promise. You're going to make me suffer reputation Aly now. And I said, you look, you've got to do this, Nigel. You can keep that promise, you know. Now I suppose you fail to keep the promise, and you come to me ashamed. Face Italy in the mitt afterwards, G I I just couldn't do it, you know? So I I just didn't turn up and do what I supposed to do. And I feel bad, and I said he would Look, Nigel, you did wrong in doing that. We all agree with that. You broke the rules of promising. Let's go. And I say you could have kept that promise. Now, this is the notion of responsibility. If I think you could have kept that promise, I'm not treating you like a deterministic mechanism. I'm thinking you have that ability that I'm expressing. But I want to say is that for these people, that would be a natural way off conveying the same attitude towards you as the mija conveyed before the act by saying you can do it afterwards, you failed rocks that you could have done it, you know, expressing the same heartache, Cherie, sort of attitude on that fits exactly with my sort of image. That ethics emerges on a social basis among creatures who, in order to achieve credibility with one another, have the idea of avowing their desires, giving them entry. So speak to the space of the valuable, the idea of the valuable versus the attractive. But equally these creatures who come to recognize that they have an influence on one another are going to be exhorting one another. And in exhorting another, they're going to open up the entry to the space of responsibility because there's going to be now the possibility off, as it were, retrospective exaltation, which I think is what blame really is and turn the story of the birth of ethics. Did you change your mind about aspects of ethics? Or do you think you were telling a story that illustrated something you believed already? Yeah. I mean, this may be disingenuous, I suppose, but the truth is, I really didn't know where it was going to leave me. I mean, I don't seem very taken by the notion of contractor Johnny Allergy, and I do feel that while it's often been used in philosophy, it's not often recognized as being used. So, for example, Hegel a heart, you know, an experiment Law is did exactly that. You go to a society without law. You describe predicaments and problems that people were defaced. And, hey, presto, you tell a story about how something with a marriage that now deserves because law. So I really wanted to do that for ethics because of partly being very frustrated. I'm a naturalist about ethics, and I'm a realist about ethics, you know, and being very frustrated at the stalemate, really, between the different sides and that issue and the sum of snide attitude sometimes adopted by people on either side of that divide. And I thought, Well, maybe this might be a way through Philip ETA, Thank you very much. A real pleasure. Thank you. For more philosophy bites, go to www dot philosophy bites dot com.

Presumably, you could have decided to go shopping instead. Whatever worlds are possible, is it possible to imagine that rather than listening to philosophy bites, you chose instead to buy a one way ticket to North Korea? Helen B. B is fascinated by possible worlds. Helen BB. Welcome to philosophy bites. Hi, Nigel. It's great to be here. The topic we're gonna focus on is possible worlds. That sounds like something out of science fiction. What is a possible world, and why would it matter to a philosopher? Perhaps the best way to start thinking about it is to think about the way in which possible worlds were introduced into philosophy, which having a really long time ago. So Gottfried Lightning, it's in the late 17th early 18th century, very famously said that we live in the best of all possible worlds. On Dhe, he said that in the context of worrying about the problem of evil, so the problem of how it could be that there's an omniscient, benevolent God who creates the world where there's all this pain and suffering and likenesses thought was like God had a choice when he created the universe, he could have set up the initial conditions differently. He could have set up the laws of nature differently because he had a choice and his benevolent. Clearly he does things for a reason. This must be the best of all possible worlds. Otherwise he would have selected one of those other possible worlds, and we'd be living in that one or not this one, unlike that sort of believed in possible worlds. I think so. He did think of them as ways the world could be where God sets up the initial conditions and the laws, and he has lots of choice about how he might do that on once you've set up the initial conditions and the laws and you just let everything run its course, you're going to get these really different ways in which things pan out. Right. So here we are in the actual world, we've got the universe, We've got Galaxies, we've got stars, We've got the earth, we've got human beings and so on, because if you said the initial conditions and the laws up differently, you're gonna get a whole different kettle of fish is not just Earth is his whole alternative universes. You're going to get alternative universes where nothing very much happens a tool you're gonna get ones where the Earth never comes into existence. You're gonna get ones where human beings never evolve, and so on and so on. So that's the basic idea. Another way you might think of it is kind of when you read a work of fiction, actually, especially science fiction, because their scope tends to be so much broader. You can think of what the author is doing, in a way is kind of telling you about a small corner of a possible world. So you think about the Sherlock Holmes stories. You might think of that as saying a little bit about some very constrained space show temple region of some possible world where there are all these people Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty and so on. And if you start with that and then think All right, so what would it be to tell a story about a whole possible worlds? You can kind of take the shuttle, comes stories and expand them back in time and forward in time and kind of across all of space. Fill out all of the details and then you've got a possible world. Go back to the example from Liben. Its voter famously marked that in Condi because it was fairly obvious to him that there must be some possible world in which people are much nicer to each other than they are in the real one. Yes, that is a worry for that particular response to the problem of evil. I mean, once you take the idea of possible worlds seriously, it's very hard to agree with lightning. It's really couldn't be a better possible world than this one. You take any bit of self ring and think, Really, Come on. Surely there's a possible world where that didn't happen, and surely that's a bit better than the actual world. So yet that's not a very convincing response to the problem of evil. I don't think so. Let's talk about the word possible. Just because we can imagine something doesn't mean it actually could happen, does it? That's a worry for talk about possible worlds. So the reason why philosophize nowadays really interested in possible worlds? Because they're really interested in making sense of what's known as modality. So claims about what's necessary, what's possible, what might have Bean, how things might have gone differently. Possibles obviously find everything puzzling, but they find modality particularly puzzling. We think off and they're not just philosophers is everyone. We make distinctions between things that happen but might not have done what I might have overslept this morning. I might have missed the bus. Those are things that didn't happen but could have done where some things we think couldn't have been different. So two plus two is four. It's very hard to see how that could have been different. So that seems like it's not just a contingent truth. It's a necessary truth. And, plus was want to make sense of that difference on. They also want to make sense off what's known as counterfactual talk. So I say things like, Well, if I'd overslept by five minutes this morning, I still would have made it in time. But if I'd overslept by an hour, I would have been late. We're very good at making those kinds of counter factual claims in general, in everyday life, we might argue about some of them, but we have quite a good grip on which one's a true which ones on and again, that's very puzzling. It's like what makes these claims true or false on what possible was give you is a way of understanding modality. So when I say that, it's just contingent Lee, true that I'm sitting here today, it could have been otherwise I might have been somewhere else. You can understand that impossible Worlds tour by saying, Well, OK, that's true at the actual world. But there are possible worlds where it's not true, right? There are possible worlds where I'm not sitting here. I'm doing something completely different right now. And similarly, when you say that something couldn't have been different when I say to 1st 2 is for that's unnecessary truth. We take that to mean two plus two is four is too in all possible worlds. So it's a way of understanding, all kind of reducing, that really puzzling motile tour talk about what might or might not have happened in tow. Some talk that ends up just being talked about possible world. So that's why it's a really useful thing for philosophers. But why is it useful to be able to describe it in those terms? I mean, why is it useful to be able to say that rather than if I had overslept, I wouldn't be here? There is a possible world in which I ever slept and didn't get here. What's the use of that different way of talking? It's partly just a sort of bit of technical machinery. We have these UN analyzed notions of necessity and possibility and contingency are the ideas we get to analyze all of those in the same way. Just by using this very straight for device. There's a kind of deeper metaphysical reason why you might want to do that as well. So the American philosopher David Lewis, I think, was partly interested in possible worlds for a kind of deeper metaphysical reason than some philosophers are, which was to do with being really puzzled by the nature of necessity. So David Hume, back a couple of centuries ago, I was really worried about the nature of necessity. He was worried about causation, and he didn't really see how it could make sense to say that one thing guaranteed that something else would happen. It would necessitate it. He found a really puzzling notion, and I think Louis shared some of that puzzlement about the nature, necessity, and what you get to do when you move from just talking about necessity to talking about possible worlds is as it were. You suck all of the necessity out of the world. You don't need to think that there's any necessity in the world because all Anisette city talk just gets cashed out in terms of all these other worlds, right? So you don't need to think of necessity is being a part of any world. You get necessity talk coming out of talking about present where the space of possible worlds. So that's the kind of metaphysical reason for once, take them seriously. Well, while we're on metaphysics and what exists, I think I'm right in saying that some philosophers don't just use this is a tool. They really believe that these other possible worlds actually exist in the same sense. Is one way now in yes, So David Lewis very famously did believe that. And he did say that typically the response he got to expressing that belief was we called the incredulous stare, and he was worried about whether the incredulous stare kind of counted as an argument. Like those distances have any weight in philosophical arguments about this, Lewis's view was, Look, they're an incredibly useful device, not just for understanding modality, but a whole range of other things. And his line was when something's that used for, you should just believe in it. He made the analogy with sets in mathematics is it sets a really strange thing, right? There's Nigel. And then there's the set that has Nigel as its member. Different thing, Really puzzling. Lewis's line was okay, They're a bit strange, but you can't do much without sets, so you should believe in them similarly for possible worlds. And he thought that what possible worlds are really concrete entities like So there's a riel alternative universe where there are people going around doing the things that happen in the Sherlock Holmes stories, like they're real flesh and blood people there. Sherlock Holmes there is smoking a real pipe and eating real food and sitting at a really table just as much as we are. They're not sort of strange abstract entities. They're real concrete things. Just to get a clear. David Louis believed that there is a possible world in which England won every single World Cup ever. That's exactly right. You are giving me the incredulous stare now, and I'm very sympathetic to the incredulous stare. I'm myself. I'm not really sure what to think. I'd like there to be another story about what possible worlds are. That is less weird, and there are other stories out there. So, for example, there's a position that's known as as at Schism on what, as Axis say is we should more think of. This is kind of the stories. So if you go back to the Sherlock Holmes example, you take the Sherlock Holmes novels and you kind of extend the story backed into the past and into the future and across all of space, and you get this huge, massive story. Lewis thinks that's a story that's genuinely true. It's impossible what all this stuff really happens somewhere out there in logical space. I'm getting being credulous there again, what the exact it says is, No, we just have the story. So when we say that something's true, it a possible world, all we mean is there's a consistent story in which that happens. There's a possible world where they're talking donkeys. Lewis, who's a realist about possible worlds and the exact disagree that that claim is true, And that's why it's true that they could have been talking donkeys. What the exact Sis says is, No, look, there's a perfectly sensible story you can tell, as it were about an alternative universe that talking donkeys featuring, but we don't need to believe in really talking donkeys. We just have the story. So the story is kind of like this abstract entity, and that's what other possible worlds that seems more attracted to me because the notion of a possible world is surely one that isn't actual. I mean, we call it possible because it's not actually yes. So I guess there are two things to say about that. One is that Luis thinks that all that the word actual is doing is locating us in one of those many possible worlds. So it's not as though the other possible worlds have some sort of shadowy existence right? They really exist. All we're doing when we say this thing actually happened is saying that it happened in this world runs from other worlds. So it's a bit like when I stay, this is happening here. I'm locating where it's happening. It's not that here has some special metaphysical state is relative to other places right on. The second thing to say is the worry about that, as that's his story. Where you just have these kind of abstract stories, or Lewis's worry, anyway, was we need to have some constraints on what counts is a legitimate story. Watch the constraint while the story has to be internally consistent, right? If you look at the Sherlock Holmes stories and discovered that in one story it says that Sherlock Holmes was born in such and such a year, and in one of the other stories it says he was born in some other year, that's not an internally consistent story. There can't be a possible world where that story is true, right, because it will be a story that has a contradiction in it. So consistency is a constraint on what can count as a legitimate story that is a possible world consistencies or motor notion. Right? To say that some sentences collectively a consistent with each other, is just to say that they can't all be true together, and the idea of they can't all be true together. It's possible for the more to be true together. That's just another motile notion. So his worrywarts, we haven't really filtered out all the modality. If we do the exact his story, we're still left with this primitive notion of what's possible and what's necessary. And that was exactly the notion that we were supposed to be using possible worlds to do away with. You talked about questions about necessity, other other areas of philosophy that enlightened by introducing this way of speaking, yes. So one is the notion of a counterfactual conditional again, I can say, Well, if I got up five minutes later, I still would have arrived on time. But if I got up in our later, I would have arrived late. Lewis thinks you can, and this is a standard view. You can give a possible world story about that, and it basically amounts to look when I say if I'd woken up in our later, I would have been late. What we do is we imagine a possible well that's very similar to the actual world in almost all respects. But it has a few minor differences that make it the case that I get up in our later on. Now we just kind of run the laws and see what happens in that world, as it turns out, in that world that closest, most similar world, what happens is that EIroy plate, That's why it's true that had I woken up in L. A sir, I would have been late Now, Lewis uses that to analyze the notion of causation, which is a really important notion in metaphysics. So he thinks that one thing causing another really just is a matter of it being the case that if the first thing hadn't happened, the second thing wouldn't have happened. He was so thinks that you can use possible worlds for a whole bunch of other things. So, for example, there's the notion of a property, right. You have to read things. There's this property that they share again. This is a big issue in metaphysics. What does it mean to talk about properties? Lewis thinks that we should just think of properties as kind of sets of possible individuals. I think of the set across a ll. The possible worlds. All the individuals in those possible words that I read that just is what readiness is. Similarly, he thinks that the notion of a proposition. So when I say snow is white and you say Shin s vice, we're ushering different sentences, but they mean the same standard lying to take in philosophy is well, we're expressing the same proposition, which is doing in different languages. But now there's the question. Well, what on earth is a proposition that seems like a really peculiar entity? Lewis's view is, well, a proposition is just a set of possible worlds again. So the proposition that snow is white is just the sets of all possible worlds where it's true that snow is white. That sounds a bit circular, but you could kind of do it in a way that sounds a bit less circular in the philosophy that you do yourself. Have you found this notion of possible worlds has helped you? Oh yeah, pretty much Most people these days who work in metaphysics, philosophy of language, all kinds of areas of philosophy, possible world talk is just part of the currency. Now everybody talks about possible worlds, So may I worry about causation? Quite a lot and possible world tour comes up there all the time. But philosophers just used that machinery all the time, and so we run up against that question constantly. What are these things? I'm not sure. I want to sign up to that Louis view that these aerial concrete entities that's a worry for me to worry for a lot of philosophers that we're not really sure what to do about that. And I think what we tend to do in practices just think right. There's a kind of division of labor thing here. There are other people that worry about what metaphysical story we should tell about possible was. We're gonna leave it to them to sort out, and we're just gonna happily carry on talking the tool on Bebe. Thank you very much. Thank you.

I've spent a dozen years on philosophy bites, hundreds of interviews. But what can philosophy achieve? Can it change anybody's mind? Has this podcast Siri's being a giant waste of time? Poor Sega is a philosopher skeptical about the power off philosophy. Who Sega Welcome to Varsity Bites. Thanks for having me. The topic we're going to focus on is skepticism about philosophy. Now this has got a long history. People have been skeptical about philosophy almost from the moment it started. Well, that's right. If we go right back to Plato's Republic, for example, we can see that one of the earliest challenges in the dialogue is from the figure off for Simic, a CE who brazenly tells Plato that all he's doing is engaging in word games on. It's just a load of nonsense that politics is power. There's nothing else to the world on that Socrates just needs to accept that he's on a hiding to nothing. But, of course, what we get in the Republic. The response from Plato through the mouthpiece of Socrates is that in fact, philosophy is the most important of all disciplines that in fact, it can save your very soul itself the opposite of skepticism. And I remember going to talk by Richard Rorty, where for the first question, somebody said, Well, we have one like you Last week that was just words and the recent response to philosophy. It is just words. There's certainly a certain kind of skepticism about philosophy, which is completely destructive, that just wants to say it's a waste of time. It's simply people a sounding clever but saying nothing. And I think it's fair to say that that kind of skepticism is false, that there's definitely an important role that philosophy can play in the act of human understanding on that, the techniques that philosophers bring to their craft, of clarity, of understanding, of seriously interrogating assumptions that we may have that we may take for granted. But once we put them under pressure, turn out to not be tenable two, maybe even be dangerous or unhealthy, then philosophy can be incredibly powerful in that respect. So I certainly think we should all be very suspicious of the kind of aggressive, destructive, anti philosophical skepticism. But there are other kinds of skepticism we might call them philosophical skepticism, which attempt to apply the philosophical methods to philosophy itself and call into question what it is. That philosophy thinks it's actually achieving on whether it can really do some of the things that various virtual figures, for example, Plato have fought that it might be able to do. Obviously, Plato thought he could do everything he wanted philosophers in charge of the state. He thought that only philosophers could see the true nature of reality and therefore could understand how things worked and how to make them better. But what about three? Simic asses challenges. Not a completely dismissive challenge. In a sense, it's an empirical observation that in life, those who speak may clarify things. But those who have the power determined things. So in that sense, I think through Simic Asses Challenge is actually a much more dangerous and unsettling one than Plato in The Republic. In fact, gives it credit for Plato, in fact, moves very quickly to dismiss threesome, Marcus or simply un interested in philosophy and therefore, in a sense, out of bounds of the conversation. He goes on to take on some opponents that he finds easier to deal with. And one way we can look at this is to recast three Simic asses challenge in a less polemic, Lee aggressive form on. One person who did this was the 20th century moral philosopher Bernard Williams, who certainly wasn't a skeptic about the value of philosophy. He indeed was a top practitioner of the art, but he was very skeptical about the power, that philosophy and philosophers claiming for the subject and one of the examples you used to bring this out was that many moral philosophers in the history of the Western tradition. Plato's the most famous but Immanuel Kant would be another one have argued that there may be a level at which, through arguments we can determine truths and facts that will force people to be morally good, that at the very least I will have to accept that they are making a mistake. And ideally, once they realized that making mistake, they'll change. And Williams is very, very skeptical. That philosophy could do this and one of his classic rhetorical pieces of argumentation. In his book Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, he says. What is the philosopher going to do when they break down his door, smashed the spectacles from his face and drag him away on? William wanted to say that there's a certain level at which three Simic asses challenge appears to be true. But when power meets philosophy, power will win. But where Williams didn't follow for Sinica's was in thinking that that was the end of the story. That philosophy was therefore, somehow completely useless. What Williams thought philosophy could do was help us to understand that the things we value our fragile on dhe contingent upon complex histories and complex human psychologies. But there is no universal truth out there that people can somehow aspired to and which will then compel non believers or in moralists into morality. But Williams is philosophical. Point was to make you see that that didn't matter, because morality doesn't come from philosophy in the first place. It comes from our social, cultural, historically embedded lives, and that's a good thing. That's where it belongs, and philosophy can help us to understand this, but it doesn't have the power to force people who disagree with us into agreeing with us. There are people who think the moral philosophy convey be discovered empirically. Is that where you discover what's good for human being? Maybe nearest Italian turned what makes human beings flourish. And then once you realize what those things are, that's what you want to do, or you discover what will maximize pleasure, and then you have for us feed. It compels you by reason to do certain things. Yes, sir, there's two parts of what you said there that I think of both it very important that really need to be pulled apart. The first is the Aristotelian idea that there was something about living a moral life which is deeply connected to human happiness. And in some sense, that seems to be true. If we look around our world often they're cheats, the liars, the frauds. These people don't look very happy. They might get rich, but they often look like they're losing something else Now. Unfortunately, the flip side is that there's no guarantee the immorality leads to unhappiness, and there's certainly no guarantee that morality leads the happiness that seems to be a rough correlation between living a decent ethical life and being a relatively happy person. And Aristotle was one of the people who made this very clear. External luck can take all that away from you very, very quickly. But what Aristotle did hold out for was the hope that if you were sufficiently lucky in your external circumstances Oh, and by the way, you were a male citizen of Athens or equipment, Great Republic and live morally, you would be guaranteed a certain kind of human flourishing. Unfortunately, at this point in our history, there just doesn't seem to be good reason to believe that we've now got lots of experience of human life, and it just doesn't seem to add up that way. The other part of what you said there was that reason would be the key faculty through which we could discover this connection. Andi, That's somewhere that I, in the tradition of people like Bernie Williams, David Hume, great friend Adam Smith have been very skeptical that it's reason that's got anything to do with this. But if there's a connection between living ethically and living happily, it probably lies in psychological dispositions, emotional regulation, having good friends, having a good community and reason is the faculty of being good at numbers and good arguments of logic chopping, and that's very useful and has all kinds of important things to do in human life. But it's not what's gonna connect ethical living to human flourishing. You've just been talking about your skepticism about what Phyllis we can do in the area of morals. But surely there examples like, for instance, Peter Singer's work on animals, where somebody is thinking about the status of animals and how we treat them has had a dramatic impact on what happens animals in the real world. So absolutely, that's undeniable. That singer in particular, for example, in recent times has had a huge impact on people and how they've decided to live their lives. But then it's questionable whether what really had the impact was the power of the arguments he was putting forward in their philosophical merits versus the fact that the rule lot of people who already find that they care very much of our animals or discover upon thinking bit more about animals, that they do actually care about animals and the way they didn't on from there a mobile as to act in various kinds of ways. So it's certainly true that philosophy can prompt people to behave differently. But what the Williams skepticism in this sort of Hume skepticism is more about is whether it's really the philosophy that's doing the work there. Whether it's the kinds of dispositions and emotional resonance is that people already had that maybe get pushed in a new direction by being exposed to some kinds of arguments. I certainly think it would be a mistake to say that philosophy is simply impotent or simply powerless. But one thing that someone like David Hume again burning William to want to warn off is how these things can be lost control of by the philosopher. But once these ideas get out into the world, they can take on a very, very powerful life of their own, which don't bear much resemblance to their original founders or the original thinkers. What they wanted to do with them on can end up having all kinds of unpleasant consequences. And I suppose the biggest example of that would be marks on, of course, marks. His philosophy had an impact on the world, but the consequences that it generated a rather far removed from anything like what Marx himself wanted to bring about just to get this clear, You're saying that the correct way of understanding reality is to think it is a set of practices in different places at different times. And then you just have the morality that you have because of the place you were born in. That seemed to go against my own experience, that I've rejected some inherited views as it were, and that doesn't seem to me just the result of evolving history that I happen to be part off. Absolutely. But again, it's important to think about How does this kind of self reflection come about? Personally, I think that when I changed my mind about something, it's because I find that I want to believe several things, which in fact they're incompatible. So give you an example. When I was a younger man, I used to think that I was a good left wing egalitarian who treated everybody with respect until I discovered feminism and realized that I had a whole bunch of assumptions embedded in my head about what girls should do, how they should dress, how they should talk, which will completely inconsistent with the other views I held and on reflection. I didn't want those kinds of patriarchal, sexist views, so I got rid of them. But part of the process here was a self reflective, active attempting toe. Find equilibrium between the commitments knife or I had one thing that floated was very useful for was discovering that they were inconsistent, and then I had to make decisions about what the hold onto and what not So the skepticism that I'm urging here it doesn't say that philosophy can't do anything for what it can help us do is critically reflect on the kinds of things that we want to believe. And then an interesting question comes up. What is it we want our morals to do for us? There's a certain kind of philosophical assumption in much mainstream Western philosophy that the point of moral philosophy is to find out the truth about moral questions. But a very different vision comes from Frederick Nietzsche, who's often held up to be the arch sceptic, the arts debunker. But in some ways he really wasn't because what nature's main concern Waas, when it came to morality, was the question of what is healthy. What leads you to live a healthy, psychologically balanced kind of life on what nature wanted us to see is that many of our assumptions about what we think is right and wrong are corrupt covert power effects that have been slipped into our psychologies through fares, repressive mechanisms that we don't even recognize exist anymore that are making us deeply, deeply unhealthy on the task of a good moral philosophy is to uncover that on healthiness and replace it with something else. And then, if you say well, morality is all historically conditioned contingent product. Well, yes, it is But that's okay, because within that we have the capacity to reflect back on where it came from and whether we want to Chiron endorsing aspect off it. So if I am psychopath in the sense of only concerned with my own interests, I'm not gonna be reasoned out of that position. Then it's very unclear to me that there's anything I can say to you that that kind of figure is a real problem. But not really just a philosophical problem. If I'm not sure they are a philosophical problem, what we have to say, they're in philosophy. Well, this person doesn't have the emotional resonances for the rest of us to gain traction with, but they seem to me to be a social problem, So we need to design institutions which can manage that kind of human being. But philosophy isn't going to be able to help us in this regard. That's what we need politics for. Can I play more skeptical? Skeptic. Now, a lot of what you've said is optimistic about the value of philosophy in the potential for philosophy to do important things. A real skeptic would say, Well, look, reason is often just a way of confirming really unreliable prejudices that you have that they're all these patterns of thought, which we unwittingly engage in which leaders, often to force conclusions on actually, within nature, you can find a different take. That all the philosophers are doing really is reconfirming the most heartfelt prejudices they are by the apparent use of reason arriving at the position they started from so they think is always a permanent danger in this area on here. It's therefore important to take seriously the idea. I think of truth. What we need to remain committed to is the idea that there are right and wrong answers, and even if we don't always manage to find them, we're really trying to. So when it comes to the challenge of well, maybe we only think that because we're subject to a certain kind of power, that forcing us without our knowledge, to believe certain things and to falsely confirmed to ourselves false beliefs. What we need to try and do is interrogate. That is, to turn the question back on itself. What is that really what we're doing? Do we believe certain things because we actually have mistaken grounds for them or because it makes us feel better. And again, the power of philosophy here is it can actually cut through the objection you've just made releasing aspire to by saying, Well, let's find out nature. Hugh mentioned a moment ago, thought that the correct way to do this with what he called genealogy, going back into the history and finding the grubby origins of power and distortion and manipulation and unmasking them and Nietzsche tended to write debunking genealogies, that when you went back into the history, you found out that it was all lies and power and corruption. But there are other kinds of genealogies we might want to tell. Couldn't vindicator re genealogies where we go back and we do the history and we do the uncovering, We find out that actually, there's quite a lot there that we could be happy with, that we can endorse that we won't know in advance. As Nietzsche said it. There are cold, hard, unpleasant truths on. We need to be aware that we might come up against him, but so guaranteed that everything's gonna turn out that way. The time's now you're not sounding like a skeptic. You're sounding like an enthusiast for philosophy, Yes, but it's a certain kind of philosophy. It's a kind of philosophy that's skeptical about its own power. Britain Turn aspires to be more realistic about what force we might actually be able to do on, then thinks it might still be able to do rather a lot for us. Just not the kinds of grandiose vision that someone like Plato had, that it was going to literally save our souls by ordering our beliefs and emotions in line with a timeless justice. But why should we think that just because it can't do that, it can't do lots of other things that we might value very much? Maybe we could just look att, a topic within political philosophy to show what you mean by this. Yet one that's particularly pertinent to current world politics, especially in Britain, is the idea of sovereignty. Political philosophers, especially since the English political force with Thomas Hobbes, have hope that philosophers could come up with a theory off the sovereign who is the final site of authority who gets to make the decision on Hobbs. His vision was that you could identify a mechanism which would both deliver people from the anarchy of a violent state of nature into the security of the state on the person who ruled that state was the sovereign. And they had the final authority to make all decisions on wood morally justified in using violence to keep the whole thing together again. David Hume came along and suggested that probably that wasn't the case, that really what kept it all together was what he called the opinion of mankind. The psychological willingness to go along with certain kinds of power, usually because people were used to it or because the alternative was unspeakably terrible and basically went along with it on overtime. Devout, complex conventions and complex ways of muddling through. And Hume warned that if questions of sovereignty ever came on the serious contest station, it wouldn't be philosophers who would actually find out the truth of this. And even if they could find the truth of it, nobody would listen because what it would come down to be the power of competing interests. And in my view, anybody who's been paying attention to British politics in the last couple of years we'll have to see that it's not the clarity of arguments about sovereignty, whatever that might be, that has been decisive. It's the power of certain actors to impose their preferred meaning off how to determine sovereignty, which is roughly 52% of people in a referendum, and then never opening that question again. And that's how it gets determined. And what we see at the moment in Britain is precisely a fight over the opinion of mankind over what is the legitimate extent to which power in this country is exercise. Should it be shared with Brussels should be completely detached on humus. Point is, you are bonkers. If you think that philosophy is going to be what settles the question, the ideas will get forth out on the streets, in parliament, in the newspapers, in highly confused, highly distorted, highly combustible ways. Onda philosophers just going to have to watch and see that happen. Obviously, Plato had ridiculously high hopes for philosophy. I think it's obvious, but other people today who I think in terms which would fall foul of what you've said about the limits of philosophy, the people who are trying to make for us, we do more than it's capable of. Yes, I think that's still very much the case. We really need to look less to Plato and more to Immanuel Kant. Immanuel Kant has had a huge influence on Western philosophy and still remains enormously influential, both in moral and political theory. The idea that we can use reason to discover certain axiomatic truths about how human beings should and should not behave in particular. And political philosophy. The most influential theorists of the last half century comfortably John Rawls, who explicitly worked out of the county and assumption that duties about fairness about what we owe to other people, could help her structure affair a form of society and, in this sense, the really powerful modern acolyte of the dream of philosophy. That philosophy could finally not just provide answers but could provide compelling grounds. Is can't but for my money would be much better. Returning to David Hume and humans mitigated but still potentially optimistic skepticism about philosophy and what philosophy can do. Pusaka, Thank you very much. Well, thank you.

Are untrustworthy people necessarily dishonest? Can one be too trustworthy on Why does trustworthiness matter? One philosopher who can be relied upon to address these questions is Katherine Holy from the University off ST Andrews. Katherine Goalie. Welcome to Frost Bites. Thanks. It's great to be here. The topic. We're going to talk about his trustworthiness. What is trustworthiness? Well, I think just within this can mean different things in different context. What you want when you want to trust worthy spouse may be different from a trustworthy bank or trustworthy colleague. But what I've focused most on in my work is trustworthiness. In these kind of in between relationships with people you work with, maybe your neighbors, maybe people you're in a club we don't hobby with. So people you see regularly there, perhaps not your closest friends or family members. I partly started thinking about this when I had kids and I realized, what a big part of your life it is, the parents of your kidsfriends other I don't see you see a lot off, and you have quite an ongoing relationship with, but, you know, always friends with them. There's a lot of dependence. Then trustworthiness becomes important. So trustworthiness in this context is reliability. You can almost guarantee that they'll do what they say. Yeah, that's right. So one thing that's really important, particularly those kind of relationships, is people following through on what they've offered to do. So so most people can do favors for you. Sometimes they can't, and that's okay. But when someone says they'll be there, they'll pick up your kids, they'll do something for you at work. What trust within a cement stew is following through on that? Keeping that promise is no ending up letting you down after they've agreed that we'll do something that sounds quite like a psychological traits. Some people all over the place and they mean well. But they don't get to pick up your kids quite on time because something else distracted them doesn't seem obviously philosophical. What's the philosophical issue here? Well, that's a great question. I think this is a topic where philosophy has to work together with psychology but also actually with sociology and social sciences more generally. One thing I think that's interesting that a philosopher can do is to point out how often I think when we think about untrustworthy person, we focus on someone who's intentionally dishonest or manipulative or a comment or whatever. But actually, as you're saying that there are people who don't like this from time to time, who are basically well intentioned, we don't intend to let other people down. We don't mean to kind of manipulate will be difficult, but we take on too much. We get over committed or a bit disorganized were a little bit forgetful on. I think it's worth remembering that back can be a form of untrustworthiness. Facts could be just a CZ disruptive for other people's lives, of the arrangements that are making together as the person who is intentionally being dishonest. Trustworthiness with Children is also Maur than just showing up on time. It's that the person in loco parentis is actually the kind of person is gonna keep an eye on your kids. If something happens, it's going to be aware of possible dangers to protect your Children. Yeah, that's right. And I think someone's. We have different expectations of each other in exactly this sort of situation. So I guess if someone else is looking after my kids, we would all know that they should stop them falling out of the window and juggling knives in the kitchen and that kind of thing. There's some basic things that we will no, but trustworthiness requires of us. But we might have different opinions about whether it's OK to give them sweets in the middle of the day or whether to smoke in the house when they were kids around, whether to let him watch cartoons on TV. Different families have different ideas about what's appropriate, and these are the kind of things that could be a little bit difficult to negotiate. I mean, we have to live up to our commitments to fulfill our obligations. But we don't what is know what other people think we're supposed to be doing? I can make things challenging. Do you think that underlying all these different kinds of trustworthiness there's some essential thing trustworthiness that has particular characteristics? For instance, a trustworthy person is somebody who does what they say they're going to do. That's the essence of the thing. Yeah, broadly speaking. So the notion of trustworthiness I've focused on in my own work is about avoiding unfulfilled commitments. You put yourself in terms of doing what we say we're gonna do, and that's an important part of that. But I think it's also true that we often end up with commitments without explicitly saying that we're going to do that kind of thing, like so, like, if I look after your kids, then maybe an expectation that now you've got a commitment to look after my kids when I ask you to dio, there's all sorts of reciprocity like that often wind up with commitments unless we explicitly opt out of them. But silence indicates consent. So there is a broader sense off trustworthiness as avoiding unfulfilled commitment. And that would include the commitments that we explicitly speak up for, but also a much wider set of commitments that we incurred just by engaging with each other in social contexts. So what's so good about trustworthiness? Is it just a great thing if you happen to have it, or is it absolutely essential to being a good person? It's not just a kind of nice to have, but it is something that is crucial to the way that we interact with one another and all the many, many different social context in which we have to work together and have common projects. I'm a little bit hesitant about calling trustworthiness a virtue in the sort of full on sense that virtue ethicists within philosophy have used that word. That's partly because I think that someone's trustworthiness contender pulling in a different direction from other things we might want, think, offers virtues, for example, generosity or kindness, maybe even spontaneity, so that could be tensions between these things, but nevertheless, it is unethical matter. Being trustworthy. Not breaking your promises is unethical matter, and it's not just ethically important. It's also, practically speaking, at least be able to give. The impression of being trustworthy is crucial for all sorts of different relationships. If you don't appear to be transferred, the other people are not gonna want to let you get involved in their projects, toe work with them, to engage in hobbies together and so on, and that makes it difficult to get on in life. Now you've just said that you don't want this to be a match of virtue theory, but Aristotle's discussion of that you just gave quite a nice framework for talking about character traits because he sees every virtue is lying between two extremes. So we've got trustworthiness in the middle. I can imagine that on one end of the spectrum you have been completely untrustworthy. It's kind of random whether or not you fulfill commitments. But what's on the other end? Can you be hyper trustworthy to the point of being not a good person as it were? I certainly think you can be over obsessed with your own trustworthiness. There's a kind of clean hands obsession there that sometimes people can get into. So if you imagine the kind of person who is so worried about letting other people down or breaking promises that they're incredibly reluctant to make commitments or promises in the first place, that's someone who will. They may be trustworthy in a sense, where they don't break with illnesses because they have so few promises. They're actually gonna be someone. It's difficult to have a relationship with friendship. Toe work with is the kind of person who says, Well, I'll try and be there. But don't wait for me our text you later or well, you know, I think it's this, but I can't be sure. You better check with someone else and I think it's not. That person is hyper trustworthy, but they are so concerned not to break their promises, not to let people down, not besmirch the honor. We might say that they end up being very reluctant to make commitments in the first place or to agree to do things to make definite plans come. Trustworthiness come into conflict with other important values. Other important traits that we have as moral beings. Yeah, that's right. That's one of the things that really interests me most in this area is the way in which our concern for trustworthiness, which is important, can push us in different directions than an impulse that we might also have mine impulse to generosity or to spontaneity or to kindness to others. Often, when people ask us to take things on, they really want us to say, Yeah, they'd like us to agree to a new commitment. But when we know that that's gonna be difficult for us, it's gonna be difficult for us to follow through on that commitment, either because it's challenging in its own right or because we know we've got a lot of other demands on our time. Sometimes the most trustworthy thing in that kind of situations. To say no is to be disappointing to the person that front and that can feel ungenerous. We don't like to say no to people when they're asking us to do things, especially things that might be fun in their own right, that trust with a nest of exes to turn down new commitments when we're not gonna be able to reliably fulfill them where's often generosity or kindness of spontaneity or helpfulness are directing us towards taking these things on. Now you might think that's not really a conflict, because in the impacts it's not really generous to agree to things and then not able to follow films. There may be a way of kind of finessing this, but even there there's a kind of epidemic challenge, a challenge about what we can know in this area. I'm not really quite sure what I'm gonna be able to dio. I don't quite know how difficult something is gonna be. I don't know how much energy how much time I'm gonna have, and trustworthiness is always going to direct me. Thio be cautious there to kind of leave them a margin forever kind of safety zone. So I'm offering to do less than I perhaps can do. And again, generosity might instead pointing towards up in what I can offer to dio upping my commitments to help out of the people. I can imagine somebody who's incredibly generous, just giving away with their money very quickly and then not having money to give to somebody they promised to give it to. Yeah, that's right, so you get example with money their time. I think we do this all the time. So we all have a fixed amount of time. We've got our own projects and things that we value that we want to be getting on with. But we also have commitments to other people. And if we give all our time away to the people who are standing in front of us making the loudest demands, we could end up being untrustworthy by living down other people who we may also have commitments to. But I'm not quite so good at reminding us about those commitments are extracting our time from us. So we've talked so far as if trustworthiness is always a really good thing. But there must be occasions when it's a bad thing. I'm thinking, you know, I'm a torturer. I said, I'm going to show up at 3 30 I do. I keep my promise and I bring on my fiendish equipment with me and I'm completely trustworthy. But it's not good. Yeah, that's right. Certainly the promises and commitments that we make that should not be kept keeping promises is not always the most important thing. I'm reminded here the really fascinating work by the social scientists Diego Gambetta, who has done a lot of work writing and thinking about trust and distrust and trustworthiness in the context of organized crime, particularly a Sicilian Mafia. And of course, those contexts exactly are ones in which mutual trust is off crucial importance where they will have to trust each other. Trustworthiness is already cardinal Virtue, we might say. Well, those that's not a virtue in that context on dhe. Yet what they're all working together to do and trusting one another to do is commit terrible crimes, right, So we'll just worthiness in that kind of context is no admirable. It's not something that we should be recommending as a model to our Children. That's one of things that's interesting here about trust moving this. Nevertheless, these people mafiosi are trustworthy, ought to one another. And what that tells me, first of all, is that trustworthiness, in a sense, is a kind of not an empty trailer is a kind of formal trade with less substantive than some other positive traits. What it tells us to do is well, if you got a commitment, make sure you live up to it. That's what trustworthiness requires. It doesn't tell us which commitments to undertake in the first place. What sort of promises to make one could be trustworthy without having a lot of the other important ethical virtues that are crucial to life. Do you have a view about how best to cultivate trustworthiness of a good kind? Yeah, so to some extent, I think with young kids, this is indoctrination. What we have to go teach them not to lie. And then a bit later on, we have to try and teach them about white lies when it's sometimes not always best to say things in front of grand mom and like, kind of things, this is a challenge with Children to train them up into trustworthiness. But with adults, if this is something we're thinking about in the first person, how can I become a more trustworthy person? I think self knowledge is important, like knowing what you can do on what's gonna be harder for you, knowing your strengths, but also knowing your limitations is really crucial for knowing what kind of promises you can safely make and which ones are going to stretch him. That's not to say that we should never take chances, that we should never offer to do things with stretches. But if we're doing that, it can often be useful to set the premises to explain that this really is a situation which I'm doing my best. But perhaps I'm gonna need some support of some more resources to get things done. I think another thing that can help us towards trustworthiness, so that's a bit of a privilege. To be able to do this is to be in a situation which we can try and be explicit about when we're taking on new commitments and when we're not so that we are able to turn things down when we think we're going to be too demanding or push us into a difficult situation. As I said, that is a privilege. Not everyone is able to turn down yet another demand from their boss, or yet another request to help out or to do something, even though that might lead them along the line of ending up being untrustworthy. And this is something else. After I've tried to look at in my work is to try and understand how being in sort of challenging or difficult social circumstances come actually make it harder for people to be a trustworthy. If it's difficult to turn down commitments because you're at the bottom of the social heap, then that could make it harder for you to be trustworthy. Trustworthiness is a concert, isn't an abstract concept, is very much concerned with how we live from what we do, and I could see that reflecting on it could affect how I behave. Has it affect how you've lived your life recently? I think it has. I think it's made it easier for me to say no to new commitments, which I think is probably a good thing. It's easy to slip into feeling that saying no to other people is always selfish. It's always a kind of self centered matter than the camber, the most social. The most helpful thing is to say yes and to agree to more more commitments on dhe. I know that men did this as well, but I suspect there may be a gendered aspect to this, that women are expected to say yes to things more often. But thinking of them realizing that someone's trust worthiness could requires to say no up front to avoid disappointing people later on. That to me, has helped me to say no someone because I can see that saying no to new commitments is actually a more helpful thing in the long run for other people. Not just a selfish way of prioritizing my own needs and wants Katherine. Holy Thanks very much, Thank you. It's been a pleasure speaking to you.

We hope that Philosophy Bites is known for its robust but civil discussion on, although on occasion we may offend, we don't set out to offend. But what is it to be civil in discussion? Had a civility differ from politeness in our politically divisive times? Do we need more civility or less to raise? A Beige is a well mannered political theorist at Oxford University to raise a beige on Welcome to possibly brights. Thanks for having me. The topic we're going to talk about is civility. Maybe you could begin by just telling us what you mean by civility. Well, that's an excellent question. And one of the funny things about popular and also philosophic discussions about civility is how very rarely people really seem to want to answer it. So when I think about civility and I think that when we talk about civility, generally we have in mind a conversational virtue that is meant to govern, how people talk to each other both in the sense of the manner of their speech. But then also sometimes in terms of the substance of what they say. So civility is not raising your voice, no insulting people, maybe not going into areas which might be found hugely offensive by people. Yeah, I think that's the thought and implicit in what you say is also another important feature of civility. It seems to be a conversational virtue that's particularly important when it comes to disagreement. Civility is meant to govern how we disagree, and that does include things like the tone of my voice, the volume of my voice, the speed at which I talked, whether or not I allow you to respond whether or not I'm listening those kinds of things. So when we're talking about civility, we're very often worried about how people are disagreeing. That sounds just like good manners. On a personal level, you allow each other a space to communicate, and there's a chance to do that without offending the other person. Right? So very often when we think about civility, we want toe link, it thio other concepts. Common courtesy. Often we define civility as a virtue that's akin to politeness. But one of the things I'm really interested in is the way that civility deviates from those other concepts and the particular peculiar features it has. Well, what are those features? What other differences between politeness and civility? Because they sound like synonyms to me. So one of them has already come up already. It's the fact that civility seems pertinent to disagreements in particular. But there are Maura's well, one would be that civility, unlike concepts like politeness or deference or respect, seems to have a kind of characteristic minimalism about it and sometimes even verging into a kind of negative overtone, right to be merely civil to someone is to be less than polite. It doesn't necessarily communicate respect to them. It might communicate a kind of disrespect or even contempt for them. Finally, and I think that this is one of the really crucial features. And it's a feature that matters. Historically, too, is that civility seems to be a standard of behavior that we expect from people, by virtue of them standing in a particular relation to each other, namely, people who engage in a civil disagreement. Are members of the same civil society the same Civitas or state? So the idea is that by virtue of their shared membership in this particular kind of community, there expected to meet a certain conversational standard. So that point we're getting beyond just a virtue of conversation. We're talking about a kind of interaction that takes place within a particular kind of political setting. Exactly. So the idea of civility as being in some way a political virtue comes from the very concept itself. The root of civility is the Latin Civitas, and many political theorists and philosophers then have been really interested to try to understand modern civility. Contemporary civility is a conversational virtue. In terms of these classical origins, maybe you could give us a sketch of the origins. The genealogy of civility is in well. The story that's often told is that modern civility has its roots in the ancient or classical virtue of civility. OSCE, which in Republican Rome was an ideal of public spiritedness, of civic virtue and, really the quality of good citizenship and good governance. And so in the 19 nineties, ah, lot of political theorists and philosophers became interested. Incivility as a kind of virtue of good citizenship, of civic mindedness is public spirit. That's a big gap between the Roman era and the 19 nineties. Was that just that in the 19 nineties, people got interested in a concept and sort its origins right? You might think that the intervening millennia of history may may have been important in terms of how we use this word, but I think that that's true. I think, in the nineties and also in the 2000 theorists were really interested in Republicanism. Neo Republicanism, understanding modern liberal democracy in modern democracy is having a kind of ancient roots and looking to the past for certain virtues that could improve modern democracy. And does this stand in contrast with a kind of liberal tradition which says that people need pretty thick skins and we can have robust disagreement on offending people? But that's very different from harming them. The kind of trance to a male tradition of free speech. Yes, and those theorists who would want to push that point and say, Well, no, no, no. The virtue of civility is, is something else that's something low. But solid could point to an alternative history. Many theorists, sociologists like Edward Shills would point instead to civility is the virtue of modern civil society or bourgeois society. Civility is the manners of the marketplace, where we sort of bump up against each other, and we live together and share a life. But often it's a kind of rough and tumble and conflict Shewell exchange kind of life theorist of civility, in that sense, very often want to point to the 18th and 19th centuries as the crucial time where a modern concept of civility developed. But I, in my own work would want to argue that actually civility in the modern sense in the sense we touched on at the beginning as a conversational virtue pertinent to disagreement in particular dates slightly earlier. And it's a product of early modern debates about religious toleration that emerged precisely in that time, where the boundary between inside and outside the Civitas is more porous and is itself a subject of conflict. So who are the sources of this religious civility? The story, I tell, actually starts from the opposite side. It starts from trying to offer an account of who the inventors of modern incivility really were. So here. I think the most crucial figure is really Martin Luther himself. I mean, you might think of Martin Luther is kicking off the first modern crisis of civility 500 years ago because, in addition to making sophisticated theological arguments against the Catholic Church, he also decided to frame those arguments and to present them in such a way that was deliberately offensive to the social mores of his day. So for Luther, the idea that evangelism and the kind of calling out of corruption had to be done in an uncivil way was part and parcel of this idea of Protestantism as a kind of protest against the status quo. So you suggesting that Protestantism is actually the source of the kind of some would say, honest in your face telling it, How is debate that others would see is rude, impertinent and offensive speech? I think that's exactly right. There's a risk of exaggerating here, but I think it is fair to say that you can look to the origins not only of modern ideas of free speech. Fundamentalism is a kind of in your face proselytism, but also the origins of something like modern call out culture. The idea that what we need to do is call out others, cry out against injustice wherever you see it and not care about their hurt feelings. I confess to being in the liberal compare. I can see the virtues of being prepared to state what you believe in a way that you're comfortable with not being over concerned when something important is at stake with somebody else's sensibilities. I mean, you don't want to go out and offend people, but if they happen to be particularly sensitive about the issue, then going out of your way not to offend them could result in a misunderstanding about not getting the truth out about a situation not expressing your own views and may be compromising to a degree which is not satisfactory. What is the argument for this sort of civil interaction, as opposed to the robust disagreement that is characteristic of the liberal tradition? I think that's an excellent question. And it lies at the root of what I would describe as a strong tradition of civility, skepticism, the idea that the virtue of civility isn't really a virtue at all. It's a way of trying to silence the speech of others, a way of trying to suppress ideas that you don't like, or maybe even exclude or marginalize those with whom you disagree or whom you don't really see his members of a kind of civil or even civilized quality. That was the Lutheran position that civility in an unjust society isn't a virtue at all. Not only do we have a duty to tell the truth and not to censor ourselves out of respect for someone else's feelings, it's actually even a duty to offend their sensibilities because those privileged by an unjust status quo will always be offended when they're presented with the truth. So you're making a very good case for instability of the moment. What's the other side of us? Well, the other side takes that critical point really seriously. It observes this dynamic of suppression and exclusion that seems always to be at work when we're talking about civility and more importantly, when we're accusing other people of being uncivil. But then it also says that nevertheless, if civility is a kind of claim to regulating or governing our disagreements on the basis of something shared, then what really matters is what exactly it is we're claiming that we need to share in order to have a civil disagreement, because you might think that any kind of claim that we have to have something in common in order to be able to disagree is itself. You know, it already opens the door to a kind of unjust suppression or exclusion. But then you might also think what? Actually, no, we do need to share something, but it's really an important question of what perhaps you could give an example to make this clearer. So the proponent of civility can come back to the critic and say yes. The fears about suppression and exclusion are well founded but say to that, rejecting civility altogether under reacts to the challenges. That disagreements, particularly disagreements about questions that we think of as being somehow fundamental. Maybe questions of religion and politics that go to the heart of how we see the world in each other, that those kinds of disagreements are difficult to have, and yet we need to be able to have them. So when we're talking about civility, we're really talking about what are the qualities of a conversationalist that make those really difficult disagreements possible? So is this just a pragmatic issue that you're saying what's would make a conversation between two people disagree? Go well, well, probably it's not if one offends the other, so it's much better that they go out of the way. Notes. We found each other and play by the rules of civility and thereby have a conversation that is an intuitive thought, and yet it very quickly leads to problems. So if we want to define civility or the standard civility with reference to the other person's feelings at all very quickly, the very sensitive person would seem to have a kind of Vito or a kind of lock on defining what a civil disagreement is. This was something that occurred historically, too, instead of in this moment after the Protestant Reformation, when people became very worried about the uncivil evangelism of Protestants like Luther. There waas a lot of talk about the offensiveness of their speech and very quickly. The move was also to talk about the offensiveness of the speech of other disliked dissenters. So, you know, you have these wonderful handbooks of civil conversation in the 17th century talking about how atheists need to be more sensitive to how offensive there discourses, too. They're good Christian neighbours. I'm really interested to know how we could adapt this evolving concept of civility and bring it into contemporary debates because you're an advocate of civility. But so far you haven't really put the best case for it, right? I think what really sets me apart is a theorist of civility. In a proponent of civility today is that I really started out as a civility skeptic and a critic of civility, because I was very sensitive to the ways that calls for more civility. And accusations of incivility against one's political opponents could be used as a way to suppress, exclude and silence. But it's also clear that the critics of civility are generally speaking, assuming that they're interlocutors are going to nevertheless abide by certain rules of conversational behavior that they won't interrupt that they won't just hurl insults in responding, right? So the question becomes, Well, maybe civility isn't a matter of not saying offensive things, not a matter of policing our speech, are choosing our words really carefully. Maybe civility is something else. Maybe civility is the virtue in the qualities of the speaker and listener that allow us to have those difficult conversations in the first place. And so that's where I started and trying to theorize civility, really thinking about civility as the willingness to stay in the room and continue to engage with even the most deplorable of one's political opponents with the thought that disagreement itself is necessarily disagreeable. And nevertheless, it's better that we disagree that we fight our battles with words. Then we fight those battles with swords. But I can disagree forcefully with you, maybe offend you in the process without fighting you. There is a distinction still between words and blows. It's a distinction that I think increasingly is being put under pressure. If we think about Austin Ian, accounts of language and a lot of contemporary theories of hate speech and sexist speech would say, Well, no words are actions, Words do wound and words do this essential work of creating and maintaining social hierarchies and status differentials. So what really interested me in looking to the 16th and 17th centuries for a theory of what I would call mere civility as this kind of minimal, conversational virtue that makes difficult disagreements possible is that in that period, no one ever would have made the case that oh well, disagreement is okay because words don't really matter Anyway. There's a strong sense of the importance of language and the importance of the word. So the word of God, the gospel as something that must flow freely in society. So the question really becomes. How do you have difficult disagreements in a tolerant society without that society falling apart and collapsing into civil war? You introduced this notion of mere civility. Could you just freshen that out a little bit? Tell us what it means So mere civility I would define as a minimal conformity to social norms of respectful behavior, and specifically, it's the minimum necessary to keep the conversation going. But you can tell right there from that definition that the particular demands of civility or mere civility in any given conversation be highly context dependent and highly audience dependent. So instead of fixating or focusing on rules of civil conduct, the appropriate way to doff your hat where the appropriate ceremonial language or the way that we address or, you know, express deference to others instead we sort of think about civility as a prudential or practical judgment about what's required in a given conversation with a given conversationalist so that conversation can continue. But then it has this other element, which is that it remains committed also to telling the truth to our interlocutors, and part of that truth will often be telling them what we really think of them. And they're execrable views. So we're civility. One way of thinking about it is a commitment both not pulling our punches, but also to not landing them all at once so that the conversation can continue between combatants. I can see that Prudential Ia's you say this could be a great virtue to cultivate But I would suggest it's not a widely distributed virtue at the moment. And many people seem psychologically incapable off doing what you're suggesting when it comes to discussing matters that are really important to them, right? It would seem today that civility, and especially mirror civility, is a virtue and critically short supply. It's also a time in which the critique of civility is increasingly powerful. So we see this in the context of American politics today. The thought that in the face of gross injustice, civility isn't a virtue it all. It's just a demand for deference from the powerful to an unjust status quo. What worries me then, as a proponent of civility is the propensity of some people who call for civility to try to turn it into this kind of aspirational elite and sort of gentlemanly virtue that says, Oh, do but be civil right. Let's have a civil conversation. And in mistaking civility firm or demanding conversational virtues, more elite and elitist conversational virtues like politeness like deference, we risk crowding out the more low but solid and minimalist ground of mere civility that's really necessary for disagreement to be possible in a tolerant society. You mentioned your conversion from being a civility skeptic to being pro civility. How is this change your behavior? My post conversion experience has been that I've become really sensitive to the ways in which incivility and uncivil disagreement lead to a really pernicious process of people retreating into the more agreeable company off the like minded, right? So one thing I always like to point out to my students is that there's a reason that disagreeable is a synonym for unpleasant. It's much nicer to talk to people who we can be confident, agree with us already. But that's a disaster in a tolerant society. It's a disaster in a democracy. So my commitment to civility is really a commitment to learning how to tolerate the disagreeable nous of disagreement, especially on the issues that I care about most. Transit vision.
