b6c25685-d93a-4e8e-9edb-dc8eefa2f9c6,#44 The Kids Are Worth It with Barbara Coloroso,"<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Parenting expert and best selling author Barbara Coloroso shares her three foundational principles of child-rearing, how to get kids to be accountable for their actions, and what we can do as parents to raise confident, happy children.</span></em></p> <p><em>---</em></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This interview is unlike any we’ve done so far on</span> <a href= ""https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project/""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">The Knowledge Project.</span></a> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">We’re talking parenting with one of the foremost experts in the field, Barbara Coloroso. Her work was introduced to me by the mother of one of my son’s friends, (possibly as a hint towards my parenting), and once I started reading her books, I knew I had to get her on the show.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Her style is spunky, hard-nosed and compassionate all at the same time. And the qualities that her methods instill in children, mirror those that I want for my own kids — kindness, accountability, curiosity, and self-reliance to name a few. I’ll admit, as a father of two boys, I had selfish motivations to get Barbara one on one, and hopefully get the inside track on how to master this parenting thing.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re a parent, uncle, aunt, or interact with children in any way, you won’t want to miss this captivating interview.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are a few highlights from our discussion:</span></p> <p><strong>I came up with three basic tenets.</strong> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">One, kids are worth it. I believe they're worth our time, energy and resources to help them become all they can become. Second, I won't treat them in a way I, myself, would not want to be treated. And third, it must leave my dignity and the child's dignity intact.</span></p> <p><strong>I felt that bribes and threats, rewards and punishments,</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">which by the way, have become an insidious part of our culture, really interfere with raising an ethical human being. I want a child who will stand up for values and against injustices when it costs them, not when they're getting rewarded for being good because it's all about getting caught.  </span></p> <p><strong>Praise-dependent, reward-dependent children make wonderful henchmen for bullies.</strong> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">They will do the bully's bidding because they want whatever reward that bully is dangling in front of them.</span></p> <p><strong>If you make a mistake, it's a very simple formula.</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Simple doesn't make it easy. With a mistake, you own it, you fix it, you learn from it and you move on.</span></p> <p><strong>We want assertive lines, not aggressive or passive.</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our climate today of adult discourse doesn't help our kids at all, with these virulent attacks and dehumanization of another human being, which is what verbal bullying does. So we need to walk our talk and talk our walk.</span></p> <p><strong>Discipline is not something we do to a child. It's something we do with a child.</strong> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Punishment's adult-oriented. It's imposed from without. It arouses resentment and teaches kids to respond out of fear, or fight back, or flee. Discipline, on the other hand, means to give life to a child's learning.</span></p> <p><strong>If it's not life threatening, morally threatening, or unhealthy, let it go.</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let them experience the consequences.</span></p> <p><strong>I really dislike it when people say, ""My teenager's my best friend,"" I say, ""Get a life.""</strong> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">They need a mentor. They don't need a friend right now, not you as a friend. Then in adulthood, you can become their friend and you better become a good friend because they do pick out your nursing home.</span></p> <p><strong>We have 105 words for penis, and 125 for breasts, and only one for an ankle.</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We have to start young teaching kids to use their proper words. I want a little boy to say something like, ""My penis feels funny,"" instead of using all these euphemisms, wee wee, sausage and bacon, or twigs and berries and all the different words that we use.</span></p> <p><strong>Deep caring is not liking somebody.</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I tell kids, “You do not have to like every kid in this classroom, but you must honor their humanity.” Deep caring is a must to relieve somebody else's suffering, and wishing them well, which by the way, is the antithesis of mean and cruel.</span></p> <p>Listen and Learn</p> <p><strong>---</strong></p> <p><strong>For comprehensive show notes</strong> on this episode, including a full edited transcript, go to <a href= ""https://fs.blog/podcast/"">https://fs.blog/podcast/</a></p> <p><strong>Is your brain hungry for more?</strong> Don't miss out!

b6c25685-d93a-4e8e-9edb-dc8eefa2f9c6,#43 The Mental Habits of Effective Leaders with Jennifer Garvey Berger,"<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a world that changes at a dizzying rate, effective leaders need to develop the skills to keep up. Developmental coach and author Jennifer Garvey Berger shares 3 habits to ensure continual growth, accelerated learning and deepened relationships of trust.</span></em></p> <p>***</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this fast-paced digital economy, it’s impossible to see the changes that are on the horizon. That makes it difficult for leaders to prepare for what’s ahead. In her best-selling books,</span> <a href= ""http://geni.us/cvotnwH""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changing on the Job</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and</span> <a href=""http://geni.us/Gl1AHw""><em><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Simple Habits for Complex Times</span></em></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, author and developmental coach</span> <a href= ""https://twitter.com/jgberger?lang=en""><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">Jennifer Garvey Berger</span></a> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">teaches the skills and habits you can adopt today to make you more agile and adaptable to any scenario.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">During our discussion, we explore some of the methods Jennifer uses to help individuals become better listeners, better learners, and better leaders. There was so much wisdom in this interview that it was difficult to decide what excerpts to share.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here’s a small sampling of what you can expect:</span></p> <p><strong>—</strong></p> <p><strong>So much of leadership ability is about how other people experience themselves</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">in your presence. A great leader has a presence that makes other people bigger.</span></p> <p><strong>History is filled with leaders, who were told in whispers that there was disaster ahead</strong> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">and who were so certain about their own perspective that they marched into disaster headlong. A curious leader listens to whispers and begins to make sense of them, not necessarily to believe them all, but to know that there's something going on to be attuned to.</span></p> <p><strong>We have the possibility to always be growing.</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That's a glorious thing. For some people, they're into arrival.  </span></p> <p><strong>One of the different questions</strong> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">adult development theory lets us ask is, ""Who am I being right now and is that the person I want to be?"" You bring that question into your everyday life and it moves you.  </span></p> <p><strong>Over time, as we begin to ask different questions,</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">they push out our thinking and feeling and experiencing because so much of what we're doing is the answer to a question. What you wear is the answer to, ""What shall I wear today?"" Our lives are living out answers to questions we don't notice that we're asking. Asking different questions helps us lead different lives.  </span></p> <p><strong>Taking seriously the possibility that somebody else is right and you're wrong</strong> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">requires a mental yoga that you have to remember to do because what your system is going to deliver to you for free from most of our development is when somebody says something that you think is wrong, you just think, ""Well, that's wrong."" You don't think, ""Oh, what am I missing?""  </span></p> <p><strong>We tend to be looking for the root cause of something,</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">but in complexity, there's no root cause. There's no root cause of a hurricane, right? There's no root cause of a tsunami. There's no root cause in nature. There are just many forces that interact together to get you a particular effect. Similarly, there's no root cause of trust. There's no root cause of leadership. These are all a series of things that happen together.</span></p> <p><strong>You can't tell the difference in a brain scan</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">between somebody having an opinion and somebody remembering a fact. Our brains think they're the same. So, we have to get really careful with what we think is an opinion and what we think is a fact.  </span></p> <p><strong>One of the things I love about complexity is it can change from anywhere, right?</strong> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">You can change a system from anywhere. You don't actually need positional power. So, somebody who's locked in one of those patterns could begin to imagine ways to shift even if I'm just shifting my part of the pattern. What if I decided that the talk I'm going to do outside of meetings is going to be all praise for one another? How does that shift the system around me?  </span></p> <p><strong>I am continually surprised by the power of genuine listening</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. I know it sounds fairly simple, but people who are led by their curiosity and who genuinely listen to the perspectives of others, they learn like crazy.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Listen and Learn.</span></p> <p><strong>---</strong></p> <p><strong>For comprehensive show notes</strong> on this episode, including a full edited transcript, go to <a href= ""https://fs.blog/podcast/"">https://fs.blog/podcast/</a></p> <p><strong>Is your brain hungry for more?</strong> Don't miss out!

b6c25685-d93a-4e8e-9edb-dc8eefa2f9c6,#42 The Path to Perpetual Progress with Atul Gawande,"<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The world-renowned surgeon, writer, and researcher Atul Gawande shares powerful lessons about creating a culture of safe learning, the critical difference between a coach and a mentor, and how to ensure constant improvement in key areas of your personal and professional life.</span></em></p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><em>***</em></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Atul Gawande is one of the most impressive individuals I’ve had the pleasure to interview.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He’s one of the world’s top surgeons, a researcher, a prolific writer at The New Yorker, a multiple time best-selling author, and a husband and father to boot.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this fascinating interview, I’m sure you’ll find that Atul is wise and generous with the lessons he’s learned over a dynamic and accomplished career but also maintains a childlike humility, curiosity and eagerness to learn.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We cover a lot of ground in our discussion, so here are a few excerpts to give you a taste of what you can expect:</span></p> <p><strong>I like having a lot of irons in the fire.</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I like being a jack of all trades and finding the edges between things is often where I have something to add. [My ideas] come from digging in deep enough to understand the gap between what we're aspiring for and the reality of what we're doing and then trying to figure out where the bridge is to narrow that wide gap.</span></p> <p><strong>When we all have a piece of care or a piece of a problem</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, very often none of us can actually see what the outcome is and the owner can't see the function of the system. So then you start finding things like data really matter.  </span></p> <p><strong>We've been fantastic at breakthrough innovation</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and we've had no real understanding of follow-through innovation. I think it's partly that the follow through innovation can seem like it's only about nuts and bolts, instead of about recognizing that there are ways that you can actually influence and have control, some degree of control, with regard to the world around you.</span></p> <p><strong>For most of human history, for like 99.99% of it, our world was governed largely by ignorance.</strong> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">We did not know the diseases that could afflict the human body or understand them, let alone what to do about them. We didn't understand how societies rose and fell. We didn't understand how economics worked, even in the most basic components.</span></p> <p><strong>Even if we were to come to a complete understanding of all the laws of the universe</strong><span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">, we won't be able to understand all of the interconnections and all of the particularities and how they all interconnect. We're always making our best prediction and effort to be able to drive that, and so grappling, something about that is deeply human.  </span></p> <p><strong>In other industries that I've seen that have been able to create that space,</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">you know, engineers on successful teams are able to create, and you can see on teams within the same organization and the same research lab for example, you can see good and bad culture within the teams, but when the leader has made it so people can actually speak up with an equal voice. People from the highest level to the lowest level, they have all been able to contribute, and when that exchange is the way that it occurs, then you know you're there.</span></p> <p><strong>The pedagogical theory is you go to Julliard,</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">you get your 10,000 hours of practice with the violin, and you then head out into the world and you're responsible for the rest of your self-improvement along the way. That model is the primary one in professional life, most musicians, in medicine, in teaching, in business.  </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The other model is mostly out of sports and that's the coaching model, and that says, I don't care if you're Roger Federer, you will have blind spots when it comes to your own improvement and you need a coach. Over time I think what we've been learning is the coaching model beats the teaching model, and has significant advantages.</span></p> <p><strong>The fact of rising health care costs is not the problem.</strong> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What is the problem is, how much of the costs are rising that are not actually connected in any way to value.</span></p> <p><strong>I'm ruthless about prioritization.</strong> <span style= ""font-weight: 400;"">I just try to do no more than a couple of things at a time. I may do something different in a couple of months so it can make it seem like I'm doing a million things at once, but I'm not actually. I'm only doing one thing at a time.  </span></p> <p><strong>---</strong></p> <p><strong>For comprehensive show notes</strong> on this episode, including a full edited transcript, go to <a href= ""https://fs.blog/podcast/"">https://fs.blog/podcast/</a></p> <p><strong>Is your brain hungry for more?</strong> Don't miss out!

As an author, speaker, world-class poker player, and academic in the fields of psychology and cognitive theory, Annie understands the intersection of luck, skill, and making decisions in uncertain, chaotic environments better than most people on the planet.</p> <p>This is a whirlwind of an episode, and we cover all kinds of fascinating topics, including:</p> <ul> <li>The strange circumstances that shifted Annie’s path from finishing a Ph.D. in linguistics to becoming a professional poker player</li> <li>What it was like to be a female poker player in a predominantly male sport (especially before poker had become socially acceptable)</li> <li>What drew Annie into such a high stakes, time-pressured environment and why she felt like poker was the perfect fit for her</li> <li>How her graduate work in psychology informed the way she approached the game of poker — and helped her rack up wins</li> <li>How she finds the signal in a very noisy stream of feedback</li> <li>The big mistakes Annie noticed other players making that were stalling their progress in the game but allowed her to make giant leaps forward</li> <li>The role that mental models played in her learning process (and which models Annie liked to lean on the most in a high stakes game)</li> <li>The power of surrounding yourself with people that can help you expand your circle of competence — and how that made all the difference in Annie’s development as a player</li> <li>Confirmatory and exploratory thought, and how one helps us to be “accurate” and one helps us to be “right.”</li> <li>The secret pact you should be making with the people who are closest to you</li> </ul> <p>And so much more.</p> <p>This episode is just under two hours long, but there’s no fat in it.

Along with the obvious devastation of nature, it is believed that the eruption also sealed the deal for the most civilized nation on the island at the time, the Minoans. Thanks to the thick layer of ash cause by the event, the Bronze Age settlement of Akrotiri was so well preserved that we are able to see how prosperous the area had once been with an elaborate drainage systems, multi-storied buildings, incredible wall paintings, furniture and vessels. The site has as much of a significant importance as does Pompeii. The island’s main volcanic rock, its mineral rich soil, and the amazing climate, has produced some incredibly unique wines. Santorini is known for some of the oldest vineyards in the world. And we know that wine is one of my favourite topics. On today’s podcast I speak with Panayiota Kalogeropoulou about Santorini’s wines. Panayiota is the Director at the Domaine Sigalas vineyard. Paris Sigalas, a mathematician with a goal to make his Santorini vineyard a world heritage site, focuses on grapes that thrive in Santorini (these include the Aidani, Athiri, Plantana – and the prime Greek grape Assyrtiko).</p>","Thu, 05 Jan 2017 15:14:46 +0000",http://traffic.libsyn.com/theknowledgeproject/TKP_Greece_Wine_No_Ad.mp3?dest-id=271299
