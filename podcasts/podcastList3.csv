It is a rebroadcast of my weekly show of the same name on SiriusXM's channel 111 Business Radio Powered by the Wharton School.

Bay Area Ventures covers all aspects of what makes working and living in the Bay Area unique and special.  From startups to Fortune 500 companies, from politics to public policy, from venture financing to mergers & acquisitions, and even to the lifestyles of those living and working in the Bay Area, I try to cover it all in order to help you apply the great practices of the Bay Area to your ventures. The show airs live on Monday’s from 4:00pm to 6:00pm Pacific Time and is broadcast via satellite radio from our studio at the campus of Wharton|San Francisco (The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania’s San Francisco Campus on the Embarcadero in downtown San Francisco)

Every live show includes two feature guests for up to one hour each.  Each of the Bay Area Venture podcasts on Spreaker covers one feature guest interview from the show.  In addition to the feature guest, each month I host an “M&A Moment”, with Rick Climan, of the Weil law firm and every quarter I host a Bay Area Council Quarterly Update with Jim Wunderman of the Bay Area Council.  

The M&A Moment is a look at top merger and acquisition deals involving at least one Bay Area company, as well as an exploration of strategy, tactics and financing inherent to this exciting multi-billion dollar business practice.  The M&A Moment is available as a separate podcast here on Spreaker at www.spreaker.com/show/the-m-and-a-moment.

The episode of Lord Krishna imparting knowledge to Arjuna occurs in the epic Mahabharata.  There are totally 700 verses classified into 18 chapters.  Krishna gives the essence of the entire Veda in his teaching.   He explains in detail various disciplines like Karma Yoga, Devotion, Values, Meditation, and so on.  Lord Krishna also imparts knowledge about the true nature of God, World and Beings and clearly points out the underlying oneness of God and Beings.
            
            In these 322 classes, all the 700 verses of the Bhagavad Gita are explained word by word, in keeping with Shankaracharya's commentary. These classes will help the listener in gaining a thorough knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita.
            
            The summary of Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 10, given by Swami Paramarthananda, is available for download.  The main theme of this chapter being the Lord's glories, this chapter is called Vibhuti-yoga.

The central theme of all the Upanishads is the same, viz., the underlying oneness of Beings and the Lord.  Further, the Upanishads also reveal to us - the qualifications that a student needs to have in order to receive this knowledge; the qualifications essential for a teacher imparting this knowledge; the nature of Liberation; how the world is apparent in nature; and so on.  Each Upanishad explains these in its own unique way. Upanishads, thus, form the philosophical portion of the Vedas.  They are, in general, in the form of a dialogue between a teacher and a student.
            
            One may begin the study of the Upanishads from the Mundaka Upanishad as it is in this Upanishad that the teachings are given in a systematic manner.

      <p>We’ve entered a new era. The creation and collection of information play an ever-increasing — yet often hidden — role in our lives. Algorithms filter all sorts of experiences, from the mundane to the monumental. The fuel that powers and curates these experiences is…data. Data are the new oil; whoever controls data has power. Is this making things better? Worse? Raw Data is a show about <strong>how information becomes power</strong>. What are the implications for all of us, now that mountains of data are more accessible and malleable than ever?</p>

She’s the only woman on the homicide squad, and a skilled chameleon: undercover cop in vice stings, crime-scene commander, patient confidante of killers. A master interrogator, she invokes her personal experience – and deepest griefs – as a tool to elicit confessions. When a young woman’s body is found at a trash-sorting plant, Trapp learns the murder may be linked to the disappearance of three other women in nearby Santa Ana. Trapp embarks on a dark journey that brings her face to face with a man who takes “a little piece of her soul.” The series is about a singular detective on a relentless, sometimes lonely quest for answers.</p><p>From the Los Angeles Times and Wondery, “Detective Trapp” is a new story from Christopher Goffard, the writer and host of “Dirty John.”</p>

It’s a behind the scenes look at the marketing tactics and strategies that lead to a loyal following, growing sales and a business that gives you (the business owner) more freedom in your everyday life.  Each episode will be short, punchy and packed with takeaways to help you get what you have, in front of a lot more people.  It’s about leveraging your marketing to build a business that is high in profit, low in stress and one that gives you the ability and freedom to have the greatest impact on the world.  

Join leading online marketing strategist and entrepreneur, Stu McLaren, as he shares what’s working selling products online with product launches, online communities, email marketing,  social media marketing, content marketing, pay per click marketing and so much more.  This is about the marketing that leads to more sales, more profits and a high growth business.  

With that said, this show is not just about making money.  It’s about using the power of marketing to give you more freedom. The freedom to work with who you want, where you want while having the time to travel and do all the things you want. It’s about reducing the “go-go-go” stress and instead redesigning your business so you can be more present in the lives of those that matter most to you. To laugh more, live more and to create a real difference in the world.
 
For years, Stu McLaren has helped experts transform their knowledge and influence into recurring revenue by launching, growing and scaling 7 and 8-figure membership sites. In 2008, he co-founded the world’s most popular membership platform for WordPress (WishList Member). He then went on to partner with New York Times best-selling author Michael Hyatt, helping his company go from a high 6-figure business (with lots of stress) to a high 7-figure business (with low-stress). Michael’s profitability soared, his email list grew from 70,000 to over 500,000 and he gained back over 100 days with his family by not having to travel.
 
Today, Stu coaches and consults other elite level entrepreneurs, experts and influencers, who want the same kind of growth without the stress or tension of neglecting the things that matter most. So, if you’ve got an established business and you’re looking for ideas on how you can get your products and services in front of more people OR you’re someone who is thinking about starting a business and you want to see the behind the scenes of another entrepreneur doing it in in real time, the Marketing Your Business podcast is a show that is tailor made for you.",1299443864,https://www.listennotes.com/c/r/1cf50b0806114573af27c273015f2809,1574244000000,1507668986116,English,United States,http://marketingyourbusiness.com?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen+Notes&utm_medium=website,False,stu@stu.me,"[67, 93, 97, 111, 115]"

The podcast is narrated by Eleanor Reissa, actress and Yiddish theater director, and historical oversight by Professor Samuel Kassow.

“Those Who Were There” podcast features audio from videotaped interviews conducted between 1979 up to the present. ""Back in 1979, video was regarded as a remarkable, groundbreaking technology for documenting the experiences of survivors. The testimonies that resulted were and remain very powerful,” said Stephen Naron, director of the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies. “Today, by adapting our holdings to the podcast format, we have an opportunity to bring these intimate personal accounts of Holocaust survivors and witnesses to a world-wide listenership. After all, only a fraction of our more than 4,400 testimonies have ever been viewed. Every voice, every story is important, and the podcast is a chance to provide a public space for each survivor, one episode at a time.”
The podcast’s first season will feature 10 episodes, including accounts from Jewish survivors, non-Jewish witnesses and liberators. The memories shared express a wide range of experiences before, during and after the Second World War by those who experienced it. Still, it is only a small glimpse into the thousands of stories held in this diverse archive.

It's the podcast that encourages you to let go of material things and clear out your space to make room for what matters. Believe it or not, your stuff takes up your time, and cluttered spaces can be a source of anxiousness. Fill your life with the people and things that you love, and get rid of the rest. Through conversations with other women and moms on the same simple-living journey, the Minimal-ish podcast will encourage you towards the grace-filled, realistic form of minimalism that benefits your life and family most. 

But it's not just about getting rid of your stuff or tidying up your home. There's so much more. Minimalism allows you to make room to live the life you want. This podcast discusses how to live the intentional life you want to live through simplifying in every area- how to make room so you can tell the story you want to tell with the life you've been given. 

Your host, Desirae Endres, is a stay at home/ work at home mom, teacher, and writer that believes that minimalism and having an uncluttered home environment can benefit everyone, but it doesn't look the same for everyone. Minimalism has changed her life, and if she can make minimalism attainable and sustainable in her life, anyone can. She brings honesty and transparency to the conversation as an admittedly (formerly-ish) unorganized, messy and anxious person as she discusses topics of minimalism, intentional, creative  living, motherhood, and more.
