K selects I've chosen an episode from 2010. Have all the good ideas been discovered? Ah, it's an interesting one and a strange way it ties into the planned obsolescence episode we released recently, even though it was recorded almost 10 years before. And I want to make a note. It's possible that the listener male person who wrote in in this episode actually predicted the coming of the wildly popular site. Damn you, auto Correct. Proved me wrong at any rate, enjoyed this episode. Welcome to step. You should know a production of my heart radios how stuff works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast on Josh Clark. With me, as always, is Charles W. Chuck Bryant. And that makes this stuff you should know. That's right. Yes, it is not. Other imitators don't have many times. I've said that. That makes this stuff you should know. No, that's just the whole spiel. A whole opening. Hey, welcome to the podcast. Well, you've said it about 270 sometimes. I think luckily, we have them all saved. Could count. We D'oh! I don't know if it's lucky, though. Chuck. That's a lot of shows. Dude. We should do something special for 300. That's like that's a lot of shows. It ISS that makes me proud. Okay, Well, do you think maybe we could get some cake around here or something? That shrimp cocktail for the love of Pete? No, I'm allergic to shrimp now, remember? I know, but I still like to throw it out there. Actually, Dix, I eat a shrimp want on the other day, and nothing happened. Really? All right, Ada want time with shrimp and nothing happened. So it was just like, tiny little bits of shrimp. And I don't know either that or I'm getting stronger. Maybe so superhuman. You might say trans human. Speaking of human. Yes. Um, Chuck, there is a Ah, recent study that came out in part from one of our universities here in this city. Emery, right down the street grade school. There's been this problem that's been plaguing researchers for a really long time. And that is at the beginning of the lower Paleolithic period, which is about 2.7 million years ago. Okay, we started using sharp rocks as bashing and cutting tools. Okay, so we figured that out. OK, you can take a rock. That's technology. Sure. That's not horse. That's technology. Yes. OK, you can take this rock, and you can use it to open a coconut or the head of someone who's wrong. Do you using an implement to complete attack? Well, specifically, sharp rocks. Okay. It took two million years the end of the lower Paleolithic period before we figured out that we could actually attention handles to these things in tournament along it. Yes. Wow. And this is baffled scientists like, how could it possibly have taken two million years to go from using your hand to attaching a stick? You know? Sure, if this doesn't make any sense. So, um Well, they were dumb back then. Well, a dumb is close to it. They would literally We're lacking the region of the brain needed. Apparently, according to this new study, um, they the basically we developed a region in the right hemisphere, specifically the super a marginal gyros which allowed us to g o I. Let's put a handle on this. And after we did that, we moved out of Africa and started colonizing the rest of the world so that they pinpointed the region of the brain that is specific to innovation to specific Thio Stone tool making. Okay, I thought you meant innovation in general. No, like, that's where your ideas come from. No. Give me a second. All right, Shoot. Did I ruin it? It's okay. Okay. Um, so we go from can't figure out how to attach a handle to a sharp rock. Okay. Two million years, we figure that out, we leave Africa, and we start colonizing the rest of world, and all of a sudden, things start entering light speed, right? And it seems like over the last a couple 100 years, you know, especially since the industrial revolution, our ability to innovate, to grasp new ideas, to understand the world around us. sure has just been hitting this hyper speed. And a lot of people wonder if we've reached the point where all the ideas, all the good ones, at least have already been discovered. All the we understand how everything works and there's really just figuring out how to dot the I's and cross the tease right? Right. There was actually a guy who famously said in 18 99 a guy named Charles Buell. I love this quote. Here's a He was wth economy xin er of the patents office. It's attributed to him, I should say, but he said something like everything that could be invented has already been invented. And he said this in a memo, basically saying like, you should go ahead and shut down the patent office. He clearly had never considered the Snuggie piece Josh nice or anything that's been invented since 1900. So here's what I'm gonna say. I'm gonna go ahead and give you my summation early on. Okay, is that I think people think at various times in history that they've plateau, and then I think things happen. People come along innovators, and then they reach new heights and they go Oh, well, we didn't know that right? And we're there are new ideas, right? It's almost It almost displays a shameful lack of historic awareness to say we've reached the end of all of our good ideas. It's just silly. It's just ask him to be made a fool of yeah, or for people that maybe people do that on purpose to go the innovators in the saint. Oh, yeah, using reverse psychology, you know, that's how innovation work. You might as well just give up. Reverse psychology drives innovation, but the government There are people, though, that say that technological that really technological innovation has been stalled for quite a while. Yes, after the nineties computer revolution, everything else since then has kind of been like, ah, packaging it in better looking cases and sleeker designs. And it's all like, design oriented it is, or marketing oriented marketing or insure. These these guys Cedric Leg Air and Eric Veered Oh, we're both with scheme of business school basically say smart phones. Yes, they seem incredibly new and cutting edge, but really, they're just the packaging of several already extent technologies into a really sharp looking handheld device. But there's still a new idea. I would argue it is still a new idea, but I think what their point is is saying like before the late nineties, before the eighties, let's say, with computers. But especially the tech boom of the telecom boom of the late nineties. Yeah, like this stuff wasn't around was not true innovation, right? It's kind of repurpose ing and what you were saying, like the cosmetic changes to a computer? Um, one of the reasons why they believe that this is going on is because we've come to a point in the computer revolution, I think, Chuck, where, um, it's not you can still make tons of cash just by changing the casing of a CPU. Yeah, there's like no money. And innovation basically isn't. What I got from this one article is that innovation cost more than it's worth when you can just repackage what you've got in a sleeker design and people buy it up. Exactly. Um, these two authors of this article predict that we're gonna have to trends that will drive innovation, I guess. Currently, right? Yes, that consolidation we're basically like, especially with either. I think they're talking just about computers. Yeah, because they're saying the big hardware firms, they're going to all consolidate all of the smaller hardware firms right to where they're just basically be like the big three or five. And that will leave it to the software firms to compete and innovate so well Seymour innovation in the software siro than the hardware side. Right? And they're also saying that, um, the green boom is going to sure drive innovation that makes sense. Like coming up with sustainable packages or sustainable solutions. Yeah, totally. One of the other things they pointed out thought was interesting was the M. They said They said the tech, they call it the tech refresh cycle is too small right now. Yeah. So what's happening is they'll say you like your CD. Well, you're gonna love the Super Audio CD or Billy Ray. You like your DVD. You're gonna love Blue Ray, but gets what's coming up after Blue Ray. It's gonna be like Super Blue Ray. It's happening so fast. People aren't abandoning their current systems. They're just like, you know what? I'm gonna hold on because I don't wanna be the guy stuck with the laser disc player in a couple of years, right? So all of a sudden the same thing happens. No one's buying it, so it's not worth as much money. Which means that nobody's putting any effort into it and money into it. So innovation ceases. Right? And there's a guy named Edmund Phelps who's a professor of political economy at Columbia University, right? Yeah, and he's basically kind of saying the same thing. He's saying that, um, there's not enough money going toward innovation, But rather than the with the onus being put on consumers not buying ble raise out of fear of looking like laser disc jerks, Um, it's actually government in big business. That's not pouring money into small innovators. Yeah, he said, that's the innovation is the only thing not subsidized by the United States government, which he says is actually attacks in a way, because it's not being subsidized sort of a reach you could definitely Yeah, you know, I think a lot of this guy's points air reached, but, um, what he's suggesting is if the government isn't pouring money into big business so that they can pour money into E, I guess Small venture firm. Yeah. Um, these people who are in their garages aren't going to take risks going to innovate. There's no incentive. I disagree with this. I dispute this because he's saying, like the people who do work in their garages and you know, are the Steve Jobs and Bill Gates in the seventies that they were driven by this lust for money. Exactly. And I think that's wrong. I think that people innovate first and foremost to get this idea out of their head and Berlin the reality, right? I'm glad you said this because I completely agreed, regardless of what you think of the Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg didn't invent Facebook to make gobs of money. So he invented to make real friends. Yeah, Thio innovate. And that's what that's my point that you made Is that these people in the garage the true innovators, they don't care if they have two pennies to rub together. They're still gonna be trying to innovate and make a name for themselves and come up with something awesome. Right now, there are people out there who are trying to innovate for, you know, the riches. Snuggie, you're the guy who invented the Snuggie wasn't in his garage and just wanted to get this out. Or else I'm never gonna see Yeah, that's the people that are looking for the next get rich quick thing. But I think you can also make a point that, um when you introduce money to innovation, it leads to actual stagnation. Yeah, because when you introduce money, there's now, um, something to lose and people are less willing to take risks and risk is one of the driving with the willingness to take risk is one of the driving forces of innovation, you know? Yeah, thanks, Problems. It's human nature to hate problems. But why is that? After all, problems inspire us to mend things bend things make things better. That's why so many people work with IBM on everything from city traffic, toe ocean, plastic, new schools to new energy flight delays to food safety, smart loves problems. IBM. Let's put smart toe work. Visit IBM dot com slash smart toe learn more. Phelps had a good idea, and this will never happen, of course, because it's a good idea to create the first national Bank of innovation. All capitalized. Not all caps, but each word is capital. He should do it. L all in all caps with a exclamation points. But basically, it would be a bank that you could go and partner, you know, as a start up company and partner with his bank for financing. And you know what? I would get some sort of low interest loans to spur innovation. Right? That was a great idea. So it is. It is a good idea, and this does happen in the real world, and the government does pour money into innovation. He's not exactly correct in that sense. And I also kind of resented that he placed big business in between, you know, people in their garage innovating and government subsidies. We have to have big business, give them the money, and then I skim a little off the top and give it to this guy in the garage. He drawn broad strokes here for sure, there are government programs, and we'll talk about one from the National Institutes of Health, where the government says, Hey, you have a really good idea. Mr. Or Ms Research scientist. And we're gonna give you enough money to survive for three years. Yeah, because the deal is you can always get grants if you know you put together a nice package. But this program with the N i H. What's it called the ah, New innovator or directors New Innovator Award. Yeah, this is intended for people who have such a good idea. But it's so new that they don't have the data to write a grant for people to say, like, looks like you're on to something here. So they're sort of throwing money at stuff that's like, You know, you're the dude in the garage and we believe in this idea. Go see what you can find out, right? And we're keeping big business out of the way. Yes, but now that and I h owned you for the rest of your career and probably so yeah, so let's talk about there's three people at U. C. L. A. That got these grants recently and they're up to some kind of some interesting one could say innovative stuff. All right. They have some good ideas, hugely innovative about how Thio approach problems like the Professor Dino de Carlo. All these think these people are younger than us, By the way, I'm sure they're, um Dino De Carlo is working on ways to basically apply heat or pressure or chemicals to very specific sites in cells using nano particles and magnets, which is tough. It sounds like a winning idea. To me, it iss basically one of the big problems we have with getting cells engineering cells to do specific things like, um, I don't know, attack other cells for fun. Like you tell me. That wouldn't be like the big Christmas gift this year. If you could, like, make cells fight with one another finger under a microscope, huh? Um, then what? You have to basically try to engineer the cell, you know, time after time after time, and basically program it to do what you want it to dio What did Carlos coming up with is a way to use, um, very tiny magnets and even tinier nano particles that can basically you. My brain is so small when you move the magnet with a joystick, it attracts the nanoparticles in a certain direction or whatever. And you can have the nanoparticles apply heat or pressure or a specific chemical to a specific site on a cell and directed to go attack another cell for your pleasure. That's awesome. Your amusement. So 1.5 mill goes to ah DiCarlo And for good reason for a good reason. Uh, the other winner, one of the other winners was huge flying and you came up with Ah, basically, I'm gonna break this down easy. Instead of saying let me come up with a cure for cancer, Huang said, let me come up with a way to detect cancer so early, like way earlier than we have ever detected it before. That we can stop in his track, essentially curing cancer. Yes, and he's doing this. Uh, actually, I don't know is the thing is that she she she's doing this, um, through ah nano material called graphene that is just one atom thick. Yes, Graphene is like this super clearly not of this world material. It's literally a carbon atom thick. That's it. So it is a center for biological sensor to tell you when cells aren't doing the things that should be doing. So did you know a gram of this stuff flattened covers a football field? A Graham Wow. It's ultra light. That is thin, my friend. It's one Adam thin. So 1.5 mill tick you, Wang, Right? Well, did you explain how Oh, no. Let me try my hand at this. OK, so basically, what you do is you, um you put a graphene conductor on transistor, um, in a cell. And when these biological markers writes a hist owns or something like that, start to accumulate, they're attracted to the graphene. And these, by the way, these biological markers we found are correlated with the growth of cancer, right? The origin of candy. Yeah, that's where they're starting and win. Some of these markers, like, are attracted to the graphing. They create an electrical charge that weaken sense. And the graphene is so thin. But so Kylie conductive that with just a couple of these molecules attaching to the graphene, we would be able to detect it to be like right. It would be like, Oh, crap, You have cancer and we cure it. Right then. Wow. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, and that's a good way to approach a cure for cancer. If he asked me, did I explain that? Well, I think so. I think that the last winner this year was Ah Jin Young Lee and ah Jin is trying to debug the brain circuit using, you know, we have the Wonder machine, which is your favorite thing in the world. The f m r I. Which measures Ah, uh, measures measures blood and oxygen levels in the brain. So it tells you these areas light up there called bold signals blood and oxygen level dependent. They light up to correspond a certain brain. Right. And we've talked about this before, like you're seeing that there's more oxygen that's going to that part of the brain. So we've assumed this is the basis of the f m R. I, right? If it has more oxygen being delivered to it, that must mean that that region of the brain is active. When you show somebody a picture of you know, their kid, like being carried away into a van, right that you know, that's the fear region right here. Um, that doesn't really say anything, though, and it doesn't it. Well, it's also implicate. Well, it's It's not. It's showing. Okay, well, there's more oxygen in this region. Right? Right. What? This is what Jin Young Lee is looking at is, um how what specifically on the neuronal level is being activated right. He's using opted genetics, right? So it's going to be called the O F M r I. And that's beyond even what we thought was the Wonder Machine. So this is the super duper Wonder machine. Basically, is using light to, ah, allow genetically specified neurons to be activated, Right? You know, um, are one of our listeners that Emery has been harping on us doing one on opted genetics for a while. Really? We should get this person in here. That's probably as close as we're ever gonna come out. Good. Ah, well, it's a great idea, though, obviously, because Jin Young Lee won one of the innovator rewards as well. Yes. And they give these out every year. So they clearly believe that we're not out of good ideas. No. Excellent points of the N I h. No. And we're not out of good ideas, so yes, Chuck, we we, uh You pick those out. You found those guys, All right, Well, I didn't personally find them. You're like these guys should get the image found them. Um, there are very good ideas out there, right? Oh, yeah. But there is a debate that's raging in science um, about whether these ideas, like opted genetics or, um, you know, using graphene or nanoparticles to cure detect cancer. Um, are these variations on a theme? Are they applying cosmetic changes to a computer rather than really creating new parts to it? Right. And basically, the question is are are there any more major discoveries for us to make or are these really just basically associations? Remember, I've always said, like we have the pieces on the table. Now we just have to put together. Is that the point that we're at? Right. Um, well, you said we were I did. And then we started researching this. I'm like, I wonder, right? I think I still do believe that. Sure. Um but within that, though, there's so much that it's to me a little bit like splitting hairs. Well, but you're absolutely right. Especially when you throw in the word discovered, right? Yeah. Discovery indicates something that's already out there. We just figure it out or stumble upon it. Sure. And an idea necessarily kind of invention leads. Yeah, it leads to an invention. That's something we we've created, like technology, Theo, you know, check out. Some people are like, Oh, the holidays come earlier and earlier every year, like it's some sort of problem. Yeah, well, I would tell those people, chuck, that they need to try Make Cafe's new seasonal treats because they're going to get them in the holiday spirit. Right quick. That's right, man. We're talking warm, flaky donut sticks made fresh every morning sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. They are back, everybody, and now a new chocolate dipping sauce comes along with it. Delicious. Yeah, plus, let's just talk about the new cinnamon cookie lot. That's right. It's made with cinnamon sugar syrup hand stirred with milk and rich, freshly brewed espresso man. And then it's topped off with a Sprinkle of cinnamon. Yeah, it tastes like the holidays, and it's gonna put you in the holiday spirit. Warm up to the holidays with donuts sticks, now a chocolate sauce, and the new cinnamon cookie lot on Lee from McCafe Good is brewing for a limited time. Only participating McDonald's. Let's talk about Discovery, right? We have, ah, lot of, um, problems that are still facing us and how we understand the universe like human consciousness, right? How do brain cells create our understanding of the world like what we see is reality, right? How is that possible? And can we figure everything out? Well, that's the big question. Is there? There's a, um, like I said, there's a lot of debate about whether or not we will ever be able to figure everything out or if the human brain just simply isn't, um, programmed to understand the world fully, you know, will write Wilson. There's a guy who's a physicist. His name is Russell Standard, huh? And he's written this book called The End of Discovery. And basically, he's saying, he says, there were, in quote, a transient age of human development, right? Right where we're past the point where we figured out you can put a handle on Iraq and making an axe right. But we're right before the point where we can no longer make discoveries, not because we've understood everything right or figured everything out, but because we've reached the limits of what is knowable for the human brain. Sure, but even that look at that, that part of the ah, the right hemisphere that developed and allowed us to put the ax handle on right, right. Who's to say that our brain won't that we won't reach that point where we can't know anything any longer, can't know everything and then we evolve even further and all of a sudden we're even better at, um, understanding our world, right? But will we end up eventually coming to a point where humans understand everything and there is no more discovery to make? I say no because he points out in here and this is, I think, very valid from the midnight century that 19th century. I'm sorry. They said that a lot of people in science said, You know, we've kind of debunked religion and philosophy and all these things with scientific discovery. But he points out, and I agree that even if you figure out all the problems of science which will never happen there still human life and consciousness in the subjectivity of what goes on inside a person's head, you're never going to solve. That's not solvable, right? That's what I argue. That's a subjective ism. Yeah, I'm a foot. I think. I believe in that. They're well, they're the hole. I guess I I agree with you. Um, there's this aspect of the universe that Kant called the new Arman on new Arman on. Okay, that was specifically tailored from I think time is good, but basically the new Arman on is the thing itself, right? Yeah. Where, um it has It's just the objective. It's the objective universe, and we don't interact with that. Everything we know and understand is subjective. Yes. And this is where subjective ism is based that basically, we can never fully know anything or and we certainly won't ever know everything because one thing that will always be elusive is what you see. My reality is different than your reality. Exactly. And there's a different There's an extreme version of it called Scylla. So solipsism all right? Yes. And solipsism is the, um this extreme version of subjective ism that basically says, um, we everything is so subjective that I can't fully verify that you exist. Only thing I know that exists is my reality. But all of you may be made up. I may be totally, completely out of my mind and actually in a padded cell right now, and none of you are really, really well, that's sort of touches on the whole quantum mechanics thing, right? Don't you think, please. Well, I mean, I don't have to say about it cause we've covered it, but it definitely, uh, along the same lines. So you think? Well, yeah, there's a There's an interpretation of quantum mechanics that basically says, um, everything we know about the universe we know through observation, right? And but once you observe it, it changes. That's part of it. And when when we observe, we gain information, right? But we can't observe everything at once. So all we know exists in our reality, for sure is what we're observing. So everything else like what's going on out there in the office right now doesn't exist because we're not there to observe it. Yeah, mind blowing. Once again, it is mind blowing. But it also that we say all this not just to, you know, rock out to Floyd, but because this is this is what science is up against. This isn't just gibberish. This isn't just philosophical gibberish. As much a science would like it to be. There is a true problem with the fact that subjectivity, not objectivity, is how we interact with their universe. Even though science is based. It's supposed to be based exclusively on objectivity. Right? Right. Well, uh, Stephen Hawking, you might have heard of him And another dude named Leonard, uh, loaded. Loaded. Now. So I'm gonna Brown sent Sure there's a silent m in there somewhere. They have a new book called The Grand Design. And they are now saying that I think scientists used to say we're gonna find the theory of everything. Now they're saying, you know it. We're probably not going to find the theory of everything, but it's probably gonna be more like what they call quote a family of interconnected theories which describe your reality under very specific conditions. And this is kind of huge for Stephen Hawking because he's long been a big supporter of the theory of everything which takes the standard model of physics includes gravity, which has always been elusive, right, and then marries it with quantum mechanics to explain everything. That's the theory of everything. It's one theory that explains everything, right? Like that surfer guy? Exactly. Yeah. Garrett Lisi, I think damn it. But a long time ago, it Woz, and you know it's going to be years before he's shown to be correct or incorrect, but hawking, saying, It's probably not gonna be the case. There's going. There's too many different variables that don't fit together right? But the thing that really scares a physicist that will scare any physicist is this sports? Those are those models that we've come up with. Yeah, are they how the universe actually works or how we look at the universe and see how it works? You see, I'm saying, There's that's Objectivism again, again be whipped well, and all the things that we've said over the years that we have formed to be true are those even true, are are the conclusions were reaching just based on years of thought compiled. That may not have been true to begin with. So you don't like we arrive at reality by consensus? Yeah, but is that consensus was that even accurate along the way? Not necessarily. It's been shown time and time again that it hasn't been accurate. Through these the five revolutions, a svm Ramachandran puts him carcass. Copernicus was the 1st 1 who said that Earth is not the center of the universe. Darwinism dark, very good, Chuck Darwin's says like, Hey, we're actually just a bunch of apes DNA. Freud. Freud? Yep, 40 Freud saying, like we actually are driven by desires that we can't control and aren't really aware of d n a d n A. Which is saying, I think James Watson, who found DNA along with Francis Crick, said, There are only molecules. Everything else is sociology. I love that quote, man. It's one my favorite. And then the fifth revolution, the neuroscience revolution that were all everything. Our All of our understanding of movements and experiences are nothing but, um, neuron, all transmissions, electrochemical impulses, right? So there's not even sociology that even is just based on firing neurons, right? That's that's where we're at right now. That's why I say, I think we have everything on the table, just haven't put it together. But it's entirely possible, historically speaking, to say, Well, we thought that before, right? And we didn't in what revolution is next will that will the next revolution get us over the wall of subjective ism? Or will that be the wall that we always run into? This is a good one. Well, I was worried about this one. It came out pretty good in it. I think so. Yeah. Don't you like it when we help, like pat ourselves on the back of the Internet show? I think this one deserved it. Man. Well, from blue rays to Iran's And at the end of the day, Josh and Chuck say we're not out of new ideas. Can speak for you. Good. We're not out of new ideas. And just when you think you're out of new ideas just when you think you've plateau comes a few Wang along to say no, no, no, no. There are new ideas, and here's one. You give me the catch. If you want to learn more about innovation and new ideas, we have tons of stuff all over the site. Just type in innovation type in discovery. I'm sure that will bring up a ton of stuff, Um, and type in neurons that will bring out some pretty cool stuff to agree. Uh, you can type all those words into the handy search bar howstuffworks dot com, which means it's time for a listener mail. Yes, Josh, I'm gonna follow this very heady podcast with the opposite an email form. Okay, this is from our 13 year old fan, Peyton in California. Well, Hello. I'm sending us from my iTouch while laying in bed. I'm supposed to be asleep. So anyway, I just started listening to your podcast after my friend Claire. Yes, That's declare from California, Whose email you read on the air. Who thinks Jerry looks like Tina Fey. Claire is This is Peyton's friend. Okay, so she said, Oh, he got on the years. Start listening to you. Um, actually, I'm saying Payton is a girl. Maybe a boy. You never know. I assume Boy. Really? Yeah. It's Indrajit this right? Yeah. Ambivalent. At least, uh, Claire posted on her Facebook page that said, Listen to the most recent podcast because you guys read her letter or something. I thought it was so cool. Claire and I really good friends. Anyways, I love this podcast. Gosh, I feel so boring because I keep saying podcast, Is there, like, another word for that? Do you like that? Anyways, I definite she does that thing like the kids do now where they put like, eight s. Is that the end of a word? Have you seen that? Yeah, I don't get that. They were getting old. I guess I most definitely enjoyed the podcast on the occupy and stuff. I thought it was locked up. I I thought it was informational and funny. By the way, this email doesn't make any sense is because my iTouch is dumb and auto corrects words that I've already spelled right. Urge moving on your iPhone does that, too, and mine does that. This is an email written with one of those pens that has, like, four different color ink. You can select runs, but it feels like. But the reason I brought that up is have an idea to start a website called my iPod. My iPhone spelled. What dot com? Because you ever look at some of them send and you're like, Can you please make sure you take the sofa out of the oven when you get home? When you meant to say sturgeon, Let's say certain sofa I would well, probably surgeon. Okay, take the surgeon out of the oven, which is, I think so much better. I wish you would've planned this, okay, but any way it could make for a lot of fun, So that's my new idea. Okay. And that some lots of love from Peyton, age 13 in Cali. Thanks a lot, Peyton. Age 13 in Cali. Boy or girl? We're not exactly sure. But either way, we appreciate you taking the time to write in. And if you have a movie that Chuck and I have not seen you assume we haven't seen that you think we should see best movie best overlooked movie of all time. We're always looking for good suggestions.

You should know a production of by heart radios have stuff. Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark and their child. You took Brian over there. They're Jiri over here. Early Christmas. A dish? Yeah, we're kicking it off early, like the rest of wreath the retail world. Do you? Ah, yeah, man. This year you could find hollowing Thanksgiving and Christmas stuff in stores at the same time. Boom. Like it was just the most normal thing in the world. But, um, you don't follow me on Twitter, and you should I'm not on Twitter. Well, that's what I'm saying. You should get on Twitter to follow me. No, thank you. But at 7 30 in the morning, on November 1st, the day after Halloween, I tweeted Merry Christmas and a lot of hate back for Yeah. Yeah, well, you're going to win. Or do you just poke people like that? Yeah, pretty much. Just troll. I got you. Yeah, uh, that was my plug for Twitter. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Here we go. So, uh, let's see, back in 1983. Chuck, you were 12. Okay? I was seven. Um, you didn't have a cabbage patch, kid, did you? Well, there's a story there. If you really want to know. I think you've told before. But let's have it. Well, we bought my sister. One of the very first little people is what they were called before. They were Cabbage Patch kids. That's right. In Ah, Helen, Georgia. When they were handmade by egg. Xavier Roberts, who I recently learned stole that idea from a woman and ah, took it as his own and made millions of dollars off of her idea. Yeah, so I mean, I wanted maybe we'll do a short stuff about that. I want to do a full length episode, but we mean we definitely talked about because I think we have talked about, like, must have toys of the past and in maybe last year's or the year before his Christmas edition. Yeah, and we had she got the stall. Its name was Chuck, which was kind of funny, because that's my name and Ah, it was a big deal. I think it was like the number 70 something or 80 something made. And now it's worth a lot of money. Does she still have it? Huh? Oh, that's great. Um, and we'll finish with Cabbage Patch kids, and then I'll take issue with you, so go ahead. Okay. I know what you're going to take issue with. Oh, I don't know if you do know, but let me. So let me let me let me start. All right? So, back in 1983 Cabbage Patch kids were like, the must have toy of the Christmas season, for sure. And from what I can tell, they were the first must have Christmas toy ever. Now, that's not to say there weren't extraordinarily popular toys at around Christmas time before 1983 Star Wars very famously offered their early bird certificate package, which was basically an empty box. That said, at some point in the future, you will get Star Wars figures instead of this empty box. One of the great great marketing Jim's of all time. Yeah. So that was a thing all the way back in 1952 Mr Potato head was, Ah, hot toy that year. Robert the robot was, Ah, hot toy in 1954. And when you say hot toys, it's tough toe. Overstate that. Like Robert, the robot had T shirts in the fifties. I didn't even know people wore T shirts in the fifties. Yeah, he was in a movie. Um, like the there was, These were big deal toys, but my premises, This this is my thesis. Okay, this is my own. So I'll take the hit if it's wrong. Sure. But that in just the same way that there were hit movies like The Godfather, we're like Ben Hur. Before Jaws came along. There wasn't such a thing as the summer blockbuster until Jaws came along and made the summer blockbuster a thing. There wasn't such a thing as the must have toy of Christmas until the Cabbage Patch kid came along and made that a thing. So what issue are you going to take? I can't take it any longer. You're driving me crazy. Well, I don't think it was. I don't think it was cabbage patch kids. That was the must ah, have toy. The first must have two way That's what I take issue with first. Well, I don't know. I mean, I'm just speaking for my own life span, and I definitely think Star Wars counts because if you can sell an empty box to a kid for Christmas, the net, that's pretty strong position, as it must have thing. And by the way, if you're listening, the reason they sold empty boxes is because they didn't know Star Wars is gonna be a big thing. So Kiner didn't have a CZ. Many of these made ah, in the run up to the film release. But pre Christmas. So they got caught with their pants down and they realized that there was a big demand, a huge demand. Okay, They sold, like, 30 40 million of these. No, 40 million boxes trying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I don't know. 40 million Star Wars toys Okay at that, inside of a year. So Okay. Yeah, I'm not surprised to hear that. And did you know that you can even buy these empty box kits on eBay now? Oh, yeah, I'm sure. I saw one listed for 1500 bucks. I'm not at all surprised. Ah, and then just very quickly. Also want to point out that the biggest, most in demand toy of my young life was the Atari Pacman cartridge. Oh, boy, that was a 1982. Okay, that's sold seven million cartridges. Okay, great. Great. The numbers don't lie. That's a big, big number. Seven million. 40 million. You can tell us big numbers out all day long. But let me ask you this. Okay? For that empty box of Star Wars for the Atari Pacman cartridge. Did a woman have her leg broken? Because a crowd trying to get their hands on those things turned violent? Or before you answer? In addition to that, did a department store manager in Charleston, West Virginia have to arm himself with the baseball bat to defend himself from his very customers who were trying to get to the Star Wars empty box or the Atari cartridge? I would guess that the answer is no. Well, I think human behaviors have changed over the years. Don't know. From 1982 to 1983. Well, I guarantee I could find one violent incident about the Atari cartridge. I'll bet you couldn't. Well, you know, there wasn't then because there was. They met the demand. Okay, so that's a big part of it, too, right? So there have been Let's just move on from this. The cabbage pitch. Cabbage patch kids, if not worthy first, which they were. Did you have one? Yeah. Yeah. Webber. Dino, You had a Cabbage patch, kid? Yeah. I ended up taking his head off in giving him a Mohawk as I grew holder, because and not a lot to me not to be too like gender binary here, but I didn't know a lot of boys that wanted the Cabbage Patch Kid. What? I've always broken the mold, Chuck. Well, sure, knowing there's nothing wrong with it. I grew up with William wants a doll on free to be you and me, so I get it. But that's why I just don't know. I think it must have Christmas toy would be one that everybody wants. Yeah, Far as I knew, everybody wanted a cabbage patch kid. All right, We'll just put this one to bed, okay? Like a cabbage patch kid with the mohawk that you adopted yet? So Right. Well, that was a big thing. Like there was There was some hallmarks to the idea of it. Must have toy that were surrounding cabbage patch kids. Violence is one, Right? Um, there was a lot of buzz that was picked up by the media, and the one of the ways that that was generated was by, um I think Calico, who owned Cabbage Patch kids at the time, sent these dolls directly to reporters. That was a big one. Um, and the fact that there was not enough supply to meet the demand. These things kind of came together to make Cabbage Patch kids. It must have Christmas toy. And this has been carried on as a tradition ever since then. Ever since that very, very first time in 1983 with Cabbage Patch kids, there were Nintendo's that dominated back in 1988. Ah, 1989 and 1993 years in a row. Nintendo had three different products that were like the most have Christmas toy. Oh, yeah. Um, that first game console, huge dude, the Gameboy huger. It felt like Ah, And then, of course, in 1990 possibly the best game gaming system of all time. If you look at just relative to the time. Ah, the Super Nintendo console. I don't know, man. And 64 was pretty great with golden. I got in 64 was great. Yeah, with gold. And I mean, like, it would have been, you know, fine on its own. But in fact, that GoldenEye existed was the thing that made in 64. To me, that game blew my mind. Yeah, it was especially the Battle Royale where you could play your friends. Oh, man, that was fun. Yeah, we called it hunting Chase. Yeah, I get so mad. Yeah, in those. Like, that's the only time I ever got mad playing video games. Because I don't do that thing where you play online and you can you know, you can exact revenge on people. So I did not take it well when my friends snuck up behind me and shot me in the head. All right. Yeah, that was always a bummer. Ah. What about Tickle me Elmo? That was a big one, Thanks to Rosie O'Donnell. That's a little old for that. Oh, really? I was in my mid twenties. I had one. Oh, yeah? Well, you were in high school. Not really. There This was 1996. This is post high school even but that this was such a crazy that there was that, um, characteristic violence where Wal Mart employee was trampled while he was trying to re stock the display. Um, late at night, I believe. But he had a pulled hamstring injuries to his back. His jaws knee broken rib, concussion. Um, and it continues on like, I haven't read about any violence from hatchimals. But from 2016 to 2018 they were the if not one of the top must have toys of the year. And so, hatchimals how come? Because you have to put it in a dish or a bowl that you eat out of, and you have to leave it there and leave it there and leave it there. And then it hatches into a garbage toy. S o My experience is that they're pretty. They're good. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You like your hatchimals? Yeah. Are you talking? Is it like animatronic, huh? Is that animatronic? I'm talking about hatchimals? Yeah, it's it's okay. So I don't know anything about the dish. I just my experiences from my niece and I don't remember any dish away. This isn't the Are we talking about two different things? This is thing you put in water. No, no, no water. Electrocute yourself when you touch it. Okay? Maybe I'm thinking about something else. This is like an animatronic thing that hatches from an egg. But like, you have to, like, teach it and train it and raise it and give it attention. Everything. It's a bit like the Tamagotchi, but like an animatronic pet. Oh, I got you. Now I'm thinking of the thing that you it's an egg that you put in water. And after a few days, it hatches into a garbage toy. Yeah. No, that's that's not this. Got your hatchimals air much different. Okay, so So there's this tradition of a must have Christmas toy. Um, and you confined all you want about him every year because they're everywhere all the time in the media reports on this kind of stuff, in there on TV and there's ads and there's like, social media stuff now. But there's, like, a really big question. They doesn't have a lot of press associated with it, and certainly no studies or anything that I could find But there's a question took like, How does a toy become a must have Christmas toy? Well, let's take a break, and we'll get to the bottom of it right after this. Where can you pick up both ice cream and ice skates, electric toothbrushes and electric guitar amps at Walgreens? That's because now you can pick up your fed ex package is right where you shop this holiday. FedEx is helping you take more control of your deliveries. Just send your packages to a FedEx pickup location at Walgreens, and don't worry about being home to receive them. With over 8000 locations around the country, you can find one convenient for you. Visit fed ex dot com slash holiday guide to learn more. That was quite a setup, huh? I think so. So back in the day when you were shopping for Christmas, if you were a kid or a parent, it didn't matter, right? You knew exactly what to do. You know exactly how to do it. There is no no frills, no nothing. It was all just holiday joy and the goodness of the Christmas holiday season. That's right. That is correct. And you learned what you wanted if you were a kid from two things Saturday morning cartoon commercials and, ah, whatever your catalog was, the Sears Wish book is certainly one. Yeah, service merchandise catalog was another big win for us. Yeah, there's Ah, Montgomery Ward's catalog. Yeah, of course. And, um, you put this together in you introduce me to a website called Wish Book Web that might as well be called, um, time suck dot com. Yeah, it's pretty great in that because someone has gone through and scanned. Ah, is it just tears? Wish books? No, no, it's Sears, J. C. Penney and Montgomery Wall. Right? And then I think there's the occasional what stores that here they're right. They have scanned these entire wish books up to 1996 which from everyone knows, is the cut off date for nostalgia. That's right from the earliest days of 1933. And, boy, let me tell you, dude, and I know you know this because you've done it. If you go through and spend a few minutes clicking through these things in the years where you're like 6 to 12 waves of new style nostalgia wash over you like like John Hodgman would succumb to these waves. Yeah, I know. It's amazing. I remember some specific pictures. I remember the I mean, the NFL section alone brought tears to my eyes and I forgot how much they hyped football back then. You just can't stop crying. It was crazy. The clothes, the alarm clocks, the clock radios, the tech section. Um, it was just It was off the charts for me. Looking through this, I almost did nothing else today. Yeah, I know it is. Wish book, Web is pretty awesome. Like somebody went through in scanned Every single page of these gods were 100 pages each catalogs for decades worth of catalogs is it is God's work. And just to get laughs by, like seeing the 24 year olds posing in bathrobes, it's really, really funny, right? One's got like a pipe that blows. This'd just amazing. What a great website. So so which book web is kind of preserved? How you used to figure out what you wanted for Christmas, which was. You go through these wish books of these catalogs or whatever and then you tell your parents you dog, here, um, maybe drop some hints it was the correct way. The 21st century has a kind of an updated version of that, but it's still kind of follows the same general contours right where there are lists, still and like catalogs. But now it's not just department stores that have, like the market cornered on them like that's actually kind of gone away. It's very tough to find a department store catalog. I believe Myers still does that. I think they're kind of like a Midwestern target. Really? Yeah, and they have a toy catalog that they put out. Still, I believe to this year. Well, now you get the restoration hardware, right? Airai Kia. Yeah, but the But there's lists everywhere, and it seems like every retailer has one or all the major retailers have one and depending on where it's coming from, its summer more trustworthy or above the boards or or objective than others. When saying like these air, the must have toys like I'm one end of the spectrum, you have, um, like third party Web sites in publications and organizations like the Spruce or Toy insider or Toys, Tots, pets and more. And they actually evaluate the toys when they make their lists. Yeah, I mean these. It's just different now. And I don't think it's nostalgia. Like thinking things were better back then. But it was It seemed easier and better to let a kid sift through a catalog and pick out stuff. Then I guess what you supposed to do today, like, sit down with your kid at one of these websites and look at the top 20 hot toys and say, What do you want? Like, I don't I don't know how it works these days. I don't know. Maybe instead of like, dog earing the pages, you send your parents links, I'm sure you do, actually, you know? Yeah, but, I mean, if your kids are too young to be on the Internet, I'm not sure how to do it, cause I could hand my four year old the catalog and say, Pick out some stuff to be great, Right? But I'm not going to say, Hey, just log on to the spruce and go, uh, scroll down until you find something you like, right? Stay out of their parents section. What? I mean, what do you do? You have Ah, you literally have a kid, Chuck, what do you do? I don't know. I mean, we buy We just buy things that we think she might like. Um, so there's like, a whole world out there of, like, lists and websites that showed toys and stuff that she's unaware of. Oh, sure. Oh, wow. She's got a big surprise ahead of her. I guess so. That's great. I'm excited for, actually. Yeah, but I mean, you definitely feel like you're sort of stabbing in the dark, but it's too like, I mean, a parent can go through and look at those lists, but, you know, kill me. Well, a lot of people are excited about that kind of thing. They're like, This is, yeah, I don't have to let go to the store and stand there and be like, What are we getting here? You could go to some website or USA Today or the today's show, or whoever is partnering with some of these trusted sites. Like I always thought you had some more their toy insider and like, they kind of take a lot of the guesswork out of you. They're basically saying these air. What experts are saying your kid is going to want. If you go by this, you will score a home run with your kid. Yeah, I think my problem is I don't know what is bought and what Israel reviews because as you have dug up and I didn't even know this, of course they do this. Um, if you go on Amazon, they you know, you can spend two million bucks as a retailer to be on there, you know, on their top list or whatever. So Okay, yes, What I saw there was that they you spend that money to nominate them, to nominate your toy for their consideration to include on the just for a nomination. I don't know how the process works, but yeah, I saw I saw, like, the headlines say you pay two million for a slot. But if you read the finer print and saying you pay two million for them to even consider it and then I guess I don't know how they cure it. It actually kind of keep ah, clothes lid on it. But it generated like, $120 million in revenue for Amazon just to be on their list of hot toys for the year. Wal Mart. They charge 10 grand a month per toy to be on their buyers. Picks toy list and, ah, like you point out here they Wal Mart starts their list in August, and you've gotta wonder, Is that because they're making 10 grand a pop right off of this stuff per month? Yeah, yeah, they released theirs in late August before Labor Day. Even in, like, this isn't like a hey, we think these toys, we're going to be hot. This year's Here's the hot list of holiday toys and Target released theirs at the beginning of September. Um, I think Bull's eye is the name of their mascot dog mascot Supposed Mackenzie. Basically bully problem. And I couldn't see if they charge for placement or how they compile it or anything like that, which actually makes me suspect that they don't because there's plenty of ink about Amazon and Wal Marts lists and how they charge for him right in The fact that there's no one for Target makes me think either they're really keeping a lid on it are they actually don't charge for that, but so there's there's kind of two lists where if you're a parent, not even to ask. Yeah, you need to ask dogs and Doug people in camp people, right? You need to ask, where is this list coming from? And if it's coming from 1/3 party site, go look up the third party site and they will tell you and they're like about us section, how they determine what boys or what. And if you really want to get that information, that's fine. But even if Amazon or Walmart or even if target charges for placement on their lists, just the very fact that those things are on their lists is going to make them among the hot toys of the season. So it's like a self fulfilling or self paying prophecy. Yeah, I mean, I guess any time you look up something on a major retailer website, those first few things were sponsored and they say sponsored and little letters. Sometimes they don't Really? Yeah, I mean, sometimes kind of hard to discern. Ah, whether or not you're looking at the real top thing or the sponsored thing, right? And I think, like with the gift lists in particular, I don't believe that. They say that these air sponsored. I think it's just like here's the hot list. According to Amazon. Well, let's talk a bit about marketing in general around the holidays, Um, that, you know, it's a It's a science in a way. And they have found out through science that, um, happy people buy more. Ah, you are not. Everyone's happy around the holidays, but they definitely, as marketers play on the idea that you're happier around the holidays. And so you should be in the buying spirit. Definitely. When you're talking about kids, that is the case. They pummeled Children with ads. There was one study here, University of Hurt for Chair counted, 100 ads in a three hour Saturday morning kids slot, Christmas 100 100 a three hour slot. That's a lot of ads. It is, um, and then, of course, you know Children are more than one screen these days, so they're also getting ads on, you know, when they're watching YouTube or whatever. Um, just on kids websites, there's ads everywhere. I can't remember what episode we really kind of dove into that that was a good man. I think it was about advertising for Children like must have. That was the soul, you know, Gold. So? So the The idea is that just just the holiday season itself puts most of us in a pretty good mood. And advertisers say, Oh, well, if we release ads that are holiday themed will be able to kind of tap into that goodwill and good mood and, um, make you nostalgic or feel good about things. And so, um, by doing that, we'll be able to kind of tie. Are they are brand our product, too? That holiday, Um, that holiday sensation and you'll say, Oh, I do want to go by that because it makes me think of being a kid at Christmas time. That's really basic stuff. Um, I mean, like, that's everywhere. You can't get away from that in the holiday season, and there's not even necessarily anything wrong with it. It's just that's just basic marketing and advertising. 101 When it comes the holiday advertising. Yeah, and the other thing we mentioned earlier in terms of marketing, and this is also marketing 101 is about scarcity. If you have a toy, that there is a limited amount of that is when you're gonna find people trampling each other to get there because people are motivated by fear. And if you know that a toy is a must have and there aren't many of them and they're going on sale of a certain time, it is frightening What apparent some parents might do to secure that toy? Yes, so this is. Finally, we've reached the key ingredient, right? You've got lists of toys that air promoted and advertising maybe even show up with their own articles in the media. Then you have the fact that we're already kind of primed to to buy because it's the holiday season. We're in a good mood, but when you add that scarcity marketing it ramps it up to a totally different level. And when you have a must have toy that is hard to find. Like you said, people will do very crazy, violent, mean stuff to get it. And there's a lot of reasons why, even if you're not willing to like throw an elbow to get a toy, you might still be willing to camp out at 4 a.m. Waiting for, you know, a 24 hour retailer to restock, um, their their supply of this so you can buy it. That's unusual behavior. And the reason why it all comes down to scarcity. Marketing the idea that we have a fear of missing out of fear, of social embarrassment, of fear, of our kids, not loving us as much as they could had we gotten them this toy and that all of these things, the scarcity marketing is the real driver. That kind of hyper charges must have toy frenzy. Yeah, and it's not, you know, just toys. You've seen everything from, um, you make a great point about Pappy Van Winkle whiskey. Oh, I should say That's from marketing land. A guy named Jacob Odds God, yeah, wrote an article on Marketing Lane where he cited that, And the Disney vault is really good examples. Yeah, Disney vaults another great one. Um, they were very famous for not just saying, like, here's all the movies we've ever made that you can buy on VHS, all in one big package. They would release them every every now and then, and you knew you had a limited time to get him, and, uh, I wasn't really hip to all this, but my dad. Ah, and his wife were way into the Disney stuff. And, you know, they were adamant about making sure they filled out the entire collection and really kept up with when they were going to be released. On what a big deal that WAAS. Yeah, that was a big one in bods. Guard makes the point, like, by making them limited and available also only for a limited time, with years, sometimes a decade in between times when you can buy these things, it creates this like frenzy to go by him. And it also makes them like a treasured part of that person's home. You know what I mean? Yeah. And you can also fake out the public a little bit and mislead them on the scarcity. You might have a lot of this stuff and just gonna lead the public to believe, like now you better go get one right now because they may not be around next week. Yeah, The people who made hatchimals spin Master um hatchimals were really hard to find and I think 2016 17 18 and Spin Master was basically accused of purposefully using scarcity marketing and for their part. They said, Hey, we were totally caught off guard three years in a row by the, um you know, the popularity of hatchimals. Other people were like, That's that's B s. You can totally ramp up production pretty fast. Um, another must have toy was fingerlings remember them from, like, last year or the year before. They were like little monkeys or sloths or dragons or whatever that would hang on to your finger. And they were little finger sized robots that would, like blink and blow kisses to all sorts of Q. Terrifying they weren't. They were cute instead of uncanny because they wouldn't have occurred. The words finger sized robots together sound right. They would cut your throat while you slept, but they were. They were caught unaware, even though they really tried hard to make him hit through social media. They were still surprised when it actually happened, but they ramped up production. They brought 1/3 factory in China Online. They went from shipping via cargo boat to air transport to get supplies here faster, and they were able to ramp up in me demand pretty quickly. So the idea that hatchimals just couldn't possibly do that really smelled to a lot of people. Like they were purposefully using scarcity. Marketing? Yeah. Scarcity. I mean, it's an interesting concept, because you see it everywhere. You know, they're there, restaurants that, you know, here in Atlanta, home. And Finch had the home and Finch burger that right? Like, one day a week. Like, we'll sell 100 of them starting at 10 p.m. On this night. And then everyone's like, Oh, my God, what is in that burger people would line? I gotta go get block. Yeah, or ah, this is a nice little tidbit here that you dug up about. Ah, supermarket experiments. Yeah, that's from article from Market Watch by Mark Elwood. Yeah, it's amazing. Even putting up a sign for soup that says limit 12 per person will make people to be like, Oh, I should I should probably buy 12 of these. For whatever reason, I might They might stop making their chicken noodle soup, right? Or in this case, it was soup that was on sale. So who knows what the price is gonna go back to, you know? Well, that's true. So, um, one of the other things that scarcity produces is this idea that there haves and have nots, right? So it's the idea that you're fearful of missing out or fearful of your kid. Not loving you isn't enough. There's a whole other, um, cognitive bias of of being a have not of being left on the cowl cold, which I guess is a fear of missing out. But there's also the benefit of being a have where if you're talking about like a fingerling, which is a $15 toy. But people were crazy for those things that leave their last year or the year before and, like just about anybody can afford this $15 toy. So even if you're like I have, not throughout the year you're down on your luck. Maybe you're unemployed where your underemployed, um, things just aren't going your way. You could still camp out and wait for that late night restocking of fingerlings and get your kid. That toy is right, and for that time you are a have and maybe even somebody with a much higher social status thing. You couldn't get that Fingerling, which makes it all the more sweet. And then let's also not forget like we said this is during the holiday season, so emotions like count extra. So to be a have when you're normally not during the holiday season because you gotta must have toy is exponentially increased. Yeah, it's a big deal. Um, because it's it. Even if it's just emotionally equal for a brief period of time, it can be a big deal for somebody. Um, I say we take our final break here, Same here, and then we come back and talk about the worst people toy flippers. Right after this, The easiest place to find holiday gifts for everyone on my list is online. And now getting all the packages I order is easier to. Thanks to FedEx. I don't have to worry about being home to receive a package because I can take more control over where they're delivered. I simply send my fed Ex package is to the nearest pickup location in my neighborhood and pick them up. It's so convenient. With over 13,000 locations across the country, you can pick up your FedEx packages near you, too. Visit fedex dot com slash holiday guide to learn more. All right, so I set up the worst people are toy flippers. Obviously, there's a lot of really, really bad people in the world, and I'm being somewhat hyperbolic. But I do think somewhat the idea of buying, targeting and buying a lot of must have toys to sell later for profit on eBay makes you pretty rotten person. Yeah, go ahead and lay that judgment down some people. D'oh! I reserve judgment for the ones who do it professionally. I think if you are a a person who is just trying to augment your, um, your own, like, holiday expenses and ah, you are for seeing a black of supply. I had a time. I say more power to you. Yeah, I'm not into it. I feel the same way about ticket scalpers. Yeah, it is. Exactly. It means the same thing. Basically, Yeah, it's it's buying up a bunch of things sometimes. And this is completely gross and awful. Using bots. Yeah, that's the pits to ah, especially for concert tickets. Like when bots buy up all the best concert tickets. Especially our tickets. Yeah, exactly that. I think anybody uses bots on ours. Well, probably not, but actually sufficient now is we've seen very few bad examples of people trying to overcharge for a sold out show. More times than not, it's a fellow listener. That's like, Hey, just come along. You can sit next to me for face value or I'm I don't even give it to you. Yeah, that happens quite a bit. And yeah, I mean, there's only been a couple where somebody's, like, you know, a $1,000,000. And of course, they didn't sell it Now, Um, but yeah, we haven't run into that. Mostly the problem is from, um, ticket outlets discharging ridiculous fees on top of our ticket price. Well, that makes us mad, And you all should know we don't have control over that. Um, we're the Eddie Vetter of podcasting. All right, But if you ever find yourself in a situation where you got shut out of the stuff, you should know show and your option is to not go or to pay, like a ridiculous amount. Just send us an email, but you on the list. Oh, God. Wow. You just opened the floodgates. I mean, there's very few left spot, so it's not like, you know, right now, you just started. Must have toy frenzy for the list. Look at what you've done. Ah, let's get back to bots. Um, these bots are so savvy that they can they can buy out. They can have hundreds of credit card numbers on file because sometimes I'll have, like, a limit to how many things you can buy. They're all these shortcuts in ways to bypass all of these safeguards put into effect, including captures. They will hire foreign workers to sit around and type in the captures to get through security, which I mean, if there is anything that says holiday spirit more than that, I can't think of it. But these bots can, uh, can sometimes buy out something in the the second that it goes up online for a regular human being to say like all right, they've released the tickets or the doll gone because they will. So what they'll do is they'll go on to like, retail Web sites and figure out what the unique I D. Is for the product they're looking for. That's the reward. It'll start right. It'll start monitoring that page because people who build these pages will put them out and just won't, you know, kind of really open the curtain for hours ahead of time so the body will have the page targeted and just keep refreshing it hundreds of times a second. Yeah, until that sale goes live and they will have ordered scores of these things or dozens or hundreds, whatever however many it can before you can. Even if you're sitting there refreshing your browser between the time it takes to refresh your page, they will have wiped the place out using these bots. And then, if you're truly sophisticated, you probably have another set of bots who take your inventory and then put it up for sale at some exorbitant price on Amazon or eBay or Craigslist or something like that. Yeah, the worst people. So, like you don't even have to do anything. You just stick your bots on it. Yeah, I stand by it, even for the the enterprising person who I just I don't know. I don't have a big problem with someone making money off of someone else's misfortune to not have been able to get that themselves. I don't think it makes someone scrappy or enterprising at all. Hey, man, that's that's fine. Yeah, I'll die on this hill. Okay, this going. So if you are one of those people that Chuck hates and you want to be enterprising, there is a, uh, article written by Lisa Smith. It's on invested p. D. A. It's called the guide to re Selling Toys at Christmas for extra money. God, she's very innocuous. Um, then there's some tips, actually, that make a lot of sense. If you want to do this, do you want to go over him? Are you going to remain mute? You go over so you could talk to parents if you wanted to write Chuck, you know. That's right, George. Good idea. Um, there because they know what kids want. You could talk to kids themselves, which makes sense. I mean, just go right to the horse's mouth. Ivory said the same thing. Um, you can talk to Santa. I thought, this is pretty enterprising, like, imagine if you are trying. So what you're trying to do here is to identify what toy you want to buy his early ahead of time as possible So that, um, you can have identified the hot season the hot toy of the season and bought them before the demand really struck. So you talked to mall Santas hang out in stores. You can talk to cashiers, stock people, all that stuff. Because not only will they know what toy you need to look out for, they'll know when these new supplies air coming in. Maybe slip him a Starbucks card or something like that with 10 bucks on it was a thank you, But be sure to deduct that from your bottom line. Sure. Bribery. Deduct that bribery, right? And then, um, you can actually hang out in chat rooms. There's entire websites that are dedicated to this kind of stuff that are, um you know, that that saved like, here's the toys were looking for I spotted summat this, you know, walmart or whatever's or this this stock. I said that Wal Mart replenishes, um, on Thursdays at 10. Um, there's a lot of stuff you can do if you really wanted to put the leg work in great. Or you could put all that energy into doing something worthwhile, right? I know what you're talking about. This is the, like, the Michael Larson approach to the holidays. The man who got no whammies on pressure luck Oh, I had no problem with him. Okay? This is virtually the same thing. No, it's not. It's somebody going. Michael Larson wasn't, uh there wasn't some Ah, father who didn't have much money that, you know, overpaid for a doll to make his little girl happy at Christmas time. Michael arson didn't do that, right? Uh, he would've, though, I'm sure of it. Oh, goodness. So that's what you can do if you want to flip toys and ruin the holidays as faras Chuck's concerns. Right. Um and that is that is a big part of the competition of people who will go by out stocks like you're not really facing them nationwide unless you're talking about people who really spots on the Web sites or whatever. But they are out there and they do. They do actually create competition and help drive that friends even further because, remember, what's behind must have toys is scarcity marketing? And if there are people out there actively contributing to the scarcity, that's a big deal. Here's what I want to hear from. I want to hear from some women listeners who let's say you go on a on A on the date from a dating app, and you sit down across from your date and you're like, What do you d'oh? And he goes, I'm a toy flipper. And she like, What's that? Use your, you know, around Christmas time I go out and buy, like, tons of toys that I know little kids really, really want and that I'm mark him up so I can make a lot of money off their parents who may not be able to afford it. Right? And just tell me how that date goes from there. Yeah, I'm kidding. It doesn't have to be a man and a woman. Can it just be anybody? It could be anybody. But, you know, I think the guy that does this is the guy that I just did that voice for, who's apparently from Jersey. Sure. They're all from teacher. See? Okay. And I love New Jersey. So, um, I feel like we've learned a lot here. Yeah, we talked about you know how it toy becomes. A must have toy of the season usually has to do with some combination of of advertising and buzz marketing as long or as well as scarcity. The flippers get involved? Um, I think and I want to back this up. Chuck, there's not a lot of stuff out there on this. This all had to be brought together. This is kind of one of those rare stuff you should know thesis ease about what makes a must have toy. Must have toy. But I think it's I think it holds up. Should we talk about some of the big toys of this year? Yes. So those lists that are out there, this helps me. Actually, we put a bunch of Well, that's the point. That's we're trying to help you and all of the toy flippers out there. So actually, this is for all the parents. This will help you get a drop on the toy flippers because I guarantee they're very few toy flippers listening to stuff you should know now because we have good people in our audience so that all those lists that are out there now we kind of compiled and cross reference them. Ah, a number of them list from target toys, tots, pets and more. That's just one Amazon. The Today show Toy Insider, the spruce crazy coupon lady who had a post about toy flipping Wal Mart and New York magazine. All those lists we looked at and we found ones that appeared on at least a couple, if not more. And one of them the 1st 1 appeared on basically every single list that we saw. Yeah, this one, the Blue Mjallby l u M e nothing to do with the rest of development. But it is. This is something that that my daughter might like. Apparently, this is another. Another thing you add water to Ah, and it blooms. But this is I don't think it hatches from an egg. I think this doll, just like, grows like a chia pet Might kind of. And like, their hair that grows is I can tell it looks like some sort of foam or Styrofoam or something, but it takes different shapes, like pineapples or cakes or something like that. So cute. And there's a think 22 different versions. Yeah, okay. At 1 10,000 of him. All right, lock it up. Yeah, but they're also Yeah, they're super affordable too. So they're they're probably going to be the hot must have Christmas toy of the year's bloom Dolls. Hatchimals are still around? Yeah. And there's one That's, um from how to train your dragon. Toothless dragon? Yeah, the baby dragon. They have a hatch thermal version of him. What? I'll surely Barbies on the list. Yeah, Barbie has a dream plane. Whoa! Which I saw in a couple of lists. Where? Um Yeah, it's a plane for Barbie. There's, like, a snack cart, and everything comes of the dog that I guess lives on the plane. Great. There's also Ella. Well, surprise. Have you heard of that? Now, I hadn't heard of it either until we started researching this. But they're like a whole brand. Umm and ah, lot of these, including bloom dolls and Ella. Well, surprised they tap into, like, this whole trend of unboxing. Do you remember when we talked about unboxing on YouTube? Where, like, people open toys? Yeah, because our good friend Ah, Joe Randazzo did his Lego man unboxing videos that were right still to me. One of the funniest things I've ever seen. Yes, great. Plugged by the way. But they still do that like they're still on. Boxing is a huge trend, and that's worked its way into toys, So Hello. Well, surprise is kind of based on that. There's like a whole line of dolls, but they're like into, like, deejay stuff in fashion and all that. But they also had surprised. And there's also a kid named Ryan's World. I don't think that's his last name, but that's his his YouTube channel and guarantee. We talked about Ryan's world in that boxing toys episode, but he's got all sorts of toys that are out where you like. You just don't know what you're getting when you open the thing. It's just surprised. Unboxing weird sub genre on YouTube of unboxing or that Remember, we talked about the one where the lady's hands would just play with things? Yeah, it was that. Yeah, remember she was like Pepe P. Yeah, it's so interesting. Uh, tell you the one on the list, though, that I like that I usually look at the toys that I'm like. What? I like to play this with my daughter. That's important. I can't be bored out of my mind, you know. Oh, yeah. Good point. Ah, in this Lego make your own movie kit Looks pretty cool to me. Yeah, I was kind of hard to see that on a couple of lists, you know, because it's like this is not motion movies you can make. Yeah, it's thoughtful. It's inventive. I love it. Yeah, where it's it's Yeah, there's They have a bunch of different stages and backgrounds and props, including a banana. It's great. So you learn how to make are you gonna get get her? That I might. I think you should look like a movie any time, buddy. All right. Can we make a, um, a flaming hoop out of a coat hanger and do things with that, too? Sure. Okay, Um and then the other one was the Fisher Price. Lincoln Mel's, which are super cute, including the smooth move sloth. Hey, I'm down with Fisher Price. Yep. And swallow huge, huge Raina. Yeah. Remember, play mobile play Mobile. Remember that? They were, like, the vaguely European kind of, um, action people. But there was nothing like violent or military about him. They would explorer or, um, I'd probably recognize him. I definitely know that name. You've seen it a 1,000,000 times, right when you see it. Yeah. I'll I'll I'll look it up and show it to you later, but it's You'll see it and be like, Yeah, of course I wait. I see him right there. Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was kind of a Fisher Price kid, but, um, you know, we still have some of that stuff that our daughter plays with. That we had when we were kids. Like the barn and the ah, the boat. And, you know, it holds up. Definitely does hold up anything else, Get nothing else. You gonna go buy a bunch of toys and flip him? I got nothing else except for 20,000 hatchimals in my garage, man. Here's the other thing, though. Chuck, like you're taking a risk because you got to predict what the must have toys. And if you if you guess wrong, you got 20,000 hatchimals that nobody wants. Boyd loved it. See that happen in real life? I guarantee it happened. So just keeping the year out, all right. Ah, if you want to know more about the must have toys, there's basically nothing. You can't know that we haven't already told you. So just I guess Go get your your kids some Christmas toys. That's right. Is that a good way to sign off. That's great. Okay, since I said, uh, is this a good way to sign off? It's time for Listen to me. I'm gonna call this from a teacher. We always like to shout out our teaches in their their students. Hey, guys, to sending one of what I'm sure is among infinite thank you's that you receive as a teacher who regularly references knowledge I gained from listening to your show in my class. My students unwittingly, uh, and I are eternally grateful for your work. They give a hearty laugh whenever I steal your characters. Took took the wise proto homo SAPIEN and urgh, the folly prone genetic defect to elucidate points about the evolution of early humans. I knew you wouldn't mind my poaching that you think, John you'll be hearing from our lawyers. You're the toy flipper of teachers. Just getting, uh, the reason I'm writing this to say, I think you should not be discouraged by any lister mail you received telling you to keep your opinions to yourself. My favorite episodes of the ones where either or both of you have such strong feelings about the subject that you can't help but go on a rant. Maybe it's just because I agree with every rant, but I feel like it is important to take a stand on issues that matter to you and admit that you're human beings with a real stake in the game. Thanks again. I'll keep listening as long as you keep podcasting. That is from John Le Bushkin. So thank you, Mr Liu Bushkin. And hello, Thio, Your students, Mr Liu Pushkin's class. Yeah. Hi, guys. Get a cool teacher. Yeah, he does some pretty cool ese doing God's work teaching the next generation. That's right. I hope he doesn't work in a public school, cause it gonna be like, Can't see God work if you want to get in touch with this, like Mr Liu Bushkin did. Or if you're a toy flipper who has an argument against Chuck's argument, we want to hear from you. Bring it. You can go on to stuff you should know dot com and check out our social links And you can also send us an email to stuff podcast and I heart radio dot com Huh? Stuff you should know is production of I heart radios. How stuff works for more podcasts for my heart radio visit the I heart radio app, apple podcasts or wherever you listen to your favorite shows.

There's Chuck. There's Jerry. This is short stuff. Giddy up. So a while back, we did a podcast. Um, I'm not even sure which one it was. But you said that your ultimate wish was to be, uh Was it fired from a cannon? Yeah. Yeah, that's like so like, yesterday's news because you might find Dr. Since then, you know what? Your current plan? Um, I actually am still in the process of figuring that out again. I am trying to figure out just how much or what parts of my body might be donated to science. Ah, if any. I've kind of been creeped out by a lot of the stories where it's like we found a head in the woods and it was clearly surgically removed. And I guess the people who it was donated to didn't need it anymore. So they just dumped it in the woods kind of stuff, right? And you don't want to one day become a soccer ball for wildlife. But the weird thing is, is like when I read about stuff like what we're about to talk about, I'm like, Well, it doesn't matter if this land gets subdivided. 100 years from now on, somebody accidentally digs up the grave. Who cares? So it's weird, like, part of me is very precious about what happens to me after I die in another part of me is like, it does not matter. Yeah, I'm in that camp. Still, I I have an alarming amount of, um, or a lack of reverence for human corpse after they're they're gone. I know. I've seen you pee on one before. No, I wouldn't do that. But it just I don't know, man. I just think that once you're gone, you're gone. So, you know, burn me up, ash me up, spread me around someplace. I liked Killian the lines and snore you Ah, I did bury my cat Laurent in the backyard, but all of our other animals have been cremated. And Emily didn't love the idea of bearing Laurent, but she was like, he's your cat. You do what you want, and I like I like him being out there. Yeah, I'm with you. So there's really no beef that you're going to get from anybody for burying Laurent in the backyard and by the way. Our I p. Laurent. Yeah, he was one of the great one. But, um, if Laurent had been say, your father and your brother or something like that with my brother. Okay. If Laurent had been your brother, if Laurent, Miss Scott and you tried to bury Scott in your yard, But you would have probably run into some issues with the authorities. At the very least, your neighbors would have been rather upset with you, and they could have called the cops on you. And the cops would have been, like, dig your brother up. And that'll be that in a dig up Laurent and be like, here he is, right? Oh, Leo's switcheroo. Yeah, well, this is definitely an old prairie kind of thing. The idea of bearing relatives on your land. Um, and it is still really very much legal in a lot of states. California won't let you, because I guess the real estate is just super valuable in that they said that their concerns that in the future like you were talking about, if they subdivide their land to sell parcels and plots that someone might be disturbed. Ah, Washington State. Indiana in Washington, D. C is on record is just being like there's no room. Sorry. Alright, bury your dead in Virginia. Probably so right. So they're so that but anywhere else you can if you own enough land, bury anybody you want to on your land, especially a family member. I think that probably greases the wheels a little more if you're actually a blood relative relative by marriage of them. But there are some rules that you have to follow no matter what. But one of the first questions you want to ask yourself before you actually do this is Do I really want to do this? Because if you're not planning on, you know, spending your your dying days on this piece of property and handing it down to your kid who wants that property, there's a good chance you might want to sell that property in the future. And it may. It may affect the resale of that house and property, knowing that there's a dead body buried in what's now a cemetery on your land. Yeah, like I could give my house one day to my daughter, and she's like gross. Uncle Scott and Laurent are back there? No thanks. And why did you make them share the same grade? It's under the birdbath. It really is. Um, so if you are going to do this Ah, and we'll get into the nit picky details after the break. But there are definitely going to be nit picky details. You can't just say, Well, it's illegal in my state. Here we go. Get me in trouble. Um, there are rules and regulations, depending on the state and the county or the district that you're in there. Definitely gonna be setbacks like you can't bury it right next to your property line. All right. Next to a stream because it's pretty. Um, it's gonna have to be well away from the water table. Any kind of water, right? And any kind of building or adjoining properties. Yeah, which I mean, really good things to keep in mind. You don't want the kid ever fouling up the local water supply? Basically, don't know. So you want to take a break and then come back and get into the real Dietz? Yeah, Let's do it. Okay. You know, chuck out. Some people are like, Oh, the holidays come earlier and earlier every year like it's some sort of problem. Yeah, well, I would tell those people, chuck, that they need to try Make Cafe's new seasonal treats because they're going to get them in the holiday spirit. Right quick. That's right, man. We're talking warm, flaky donut sticks made fresh every morning sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. They are back, everybody, and now a new chocolate dipping sauce comes along with it. Delicious. Yeah, plus, let's just talk about the new cinnamon cookie lot. That's right. It's made with cinnamon sugar syrup, hand stirred with milk and rich, freshly brewed espresso man. And then it stopped off with a Sprinkle of cinnamon. Yeah, it tastes like the holidays, and it's gonna put you in the holiday spirit. Warm up to the holidays with donuts sticks, now a chocolate sauce and the new cinnamon cookie lot on Lee from McCafe Good is brewing for a limited time only at participating McDonald's. Okay, Chuck save donned your overalls and taking your shoes off. Got a little thing of grain in your teeth, and you're saying I'm ready to bury a loved one. Just give me one first. Yeah, which I would not do barefoot but you wouldn't know. So there there are some states where you can just basically do that. You can show up at the hospital or the hospice or wherever your deceased loved one is and say, Hey, I'm a blood relative. Here's proof. Give me the body. Put the body in your station wagon and take it to your house and bury it depending on the time frame of what all this happens and again where you live. Yeah. I mean, I looked up Georgia just out of curiosity and found a few little interesting tidbits, but one of them is it. And imagine it's like this in a lot of states. Embalming is is not a state law. Uh, funeral directors do that because they have the body for, you know, a period of time, sometimes before the actual burial or ceremony or whatever you're gonna d'oh. So they embalmed for that reason. But you're not required by law to embalm the body. And if refrigeration is okay, but even if it's within a really short time span, you may not even have to refrigerate a body right typically in states that allow you to take position of the body yourself and handle burial yourself. His family, they usually say about 24 hours. And actually, I shouldn't even say about within 24 hours. If you bury the body within 24 hours, you don't have to involvement. You don't have to refrigerate it. You can just again go to the hospital, put it in your station wagon, bring it home and bury it. Probably just to be smart. You should dig the hole first. Dig the grave first. Have it ready. It's not very cinematic, but sure. No, no, no. It really isn't. Now, I think about actually dig the hole with the body right there, you know? Right? Exactly. But also, if you're going to do this, just a little tip from us, Like, make sure that somebody can see you and that they see you like, nervously looking over your shoulder a lot. And maybe let's do this at, like, dusk or nighttime. Okay? Right. Exactly. Um, and here's the thing you're also gonna have to be. You're also gonna have to create an easement for your property. And that doesn't mean you have to pave like a a concrete path that leads to the grave. But you do have to provide for some sort of future public access to that grave site, right? Exactly. Like like it has to be on the D. That that is a possibility. That's right. Um, there are some states, you say No, no, no. The funeral directing lobby is far too powerful in our state. You have to hire a funeral director. Um, it varies on a spectrum of just how involved the funeral director has to be. In some states, the funeral director would have to take possession of the body or would at least have to file. The death certificate in other states is like a total free for all. Like you can handle that. But you do have to file a death certificate, Which, from what this article says, I think they've ruse actually wrote this for on how stuff works. Um, he says that Ah, there are no funeral police, but they typically want you thio file it within, I think five days of death. Um, but you just have to file. It's one of those things that has to get done. So there's a lot of stuff. My responsibility you take on when a loved one dies, and you say I'm just gonna bury him in the backyard. Yeah, and this was another little thing that I would never have thought about or considered. Um, this is like a county clerk, so they have regular business hours. So if this happens at 501 on a Friday, you're not gonna be able to file that certificate until Monday. But if you're a funeral director, you can party 24 7 and just file it electronically, Which I would guess would be the big advantage of working with the funeral director. Sure. And the best way to do this also if you're gonna handle it yourself, is to be waiting outside of the county clerks office that when they show up the next morning and be covered in gore and grave dirt, crack it, waiting to file the Steffes death certificate there, like I got to get my coffee first. Haven't seen Monday's, um so bearing about he always hear about, you know, six feet under. That's the sort of rule of thumb that's actually not the law. In most places. Only New Mexico as faras, the United States, where it's legal to Barry about in your backyard require six feet. Um, New Jersey is four. It's astounding to me. But most states are between 18 and 30 inches that, but see that to me makes the most sense, like, six feet. You're removing the, um, body from a lot of the aerobic processes that happen in soil, Right? True. So all you're doing is prolonging this decomposition. Where? I guess if you're trying to decompose the body a shallow where grave is a better bet. But you're walking a balancing act here like you wanted to be shallow enough so that the soil is It's like part of the soil, right? But not so shallow that say, like, um, Coyote is gonna come along and be like, Oh, yes, right. And dig it up. Began. Can smell it. Yeah, which we have in our neighborhood. There are coyotes all over Atlanta. They're everywhere. Um, I have buried Laurent. I feel like a couple of feet because I wanted to make sure that he like the whole idea was that he became part of the land. And quite frankly, I didn't want to dig any further than that. Hey, I'm being honest. That's when I hit that really hard clay pan. But you don't want a smell, and apparently 18 to 30 inches will take care of that. That's enough yet. That's it. That's what my dad always said. That's right. Um and then so one of the other things, one of the last things is when you do this, you, um, are by definition your land becomes a cemetery. That's pretty cool, like you don't go in and say I need to file this little plot of land is a cemetery, just the act of burying somebody legally on your land. That portion of Julian becomes a cemetery. So it's It's protected by all sorts of, um, you know, laws and anti desecration laws and cemetery lost. And actually, these laws, like, go back to Roman times from what? From what I saw, Um, but to do that, you need to file it with your, um, there's usually like a cemetery or some sort of commission that keeps track of all the graves in the town and handsome giant book. Yeah, that's kind of the coolest thing. It's a giant book, that black book covered in dust, gold leaving all around it Yep. And when you open it, it makes a giant echoing thud When you open it, it does while you know, when you open it in the, you know, down the middle Let's say I got two. Yea, yeah. And then a creaky old finger with yellow finger now runs down until it hits the spot where they're going to enter your name in blood and says exit. So that's it, huh? Yeah, that's all I got. It's Ah, it's an interesting option. That's all I'm gonna say. Yeah, maybe. If you're thinking of doing this, look into all the laws first agreed. Uh, well, thank you very much for joining us on.

You should know a production of my heart radios How stuff works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh. There's Chuck. And there's guess Producer Josh over there, which makes this stuff he should know and all inclusive and guest. Uh, ghost host. Chuck, are you a ghost now? Did you die? No. I just thought if there was to, Josh is in here and feel left out. Oh, I see. And gang up on. Yeah, I just had a clever way to say it goes toast. You're right about that. My mouth is working today. My brain. That's all right. It's like I've been a long week already. It's only Tuesday. Really right? Yeah. Is it just me? No, it's been a long week. Mean, Today's like I don't wanna complain. Nevermind. Everything's great. Hey, let me ask you something. Does owt see? Have a noon loud or not? Yes, it's It's okay. It rhymes with Tootsie s saw. Someone put it. I think our good friends at Smithsonian Magazine. Yeah, it's ritzy. There's a bit of an R in there. Yeah, I like it. See? Alright. Like Tootsie Roll. Tootsie the dead Mummy. It's a This is a good one. This is exciting. I've been want to do one on this one, too. I had to butt in what's burdened, spurned or spurred? Spurn is where you say get away and spurs, like Go ahead. Okay, Nice. Yeah, that makes sense. Because you're using your Spurs. Spurred? Sure. I'm sure that's where that comes from. Surely. Okay. Chuck just blew my mind. Uh, what spurred this was their Let's He made some news recently because they managed to trace his last like, day and 1/2. I really like in the past few days, even. Yeah, And about 5300 years ago, he had the same thoughts that we had when we started this podcast. He's like, It's only Tuesday. And this has been a long night. Already along deadly bloody week. Yeah, I've been interested in this since I saw the facial reconstruction photos, like 30 was Jack Palance. Kris Kristofferson. Is that okay, Dude, a little bit of both. Em know. It's like they said, Mr Kristofferson, please come in. So we can. Well, now that I think about it, Kristofferson and Jack Palance are have some similarities if you put a beard on Jack balance. Really? Yeah, sure. Squinty eyes. Yeah, I guess I am. Dish, uh, face. Yeah, I can see both. Kristofferson, man. What a legend, Remember? Ah, yeah. Look, there's Kris Kristofferson. Kidding? That's it. See? Yeah. I mean, it's me and Bobby McGee right there. Exactly. Did you see that Ken Burns documentary now? I didn't. Not yet. You haven't yet? Still? No. I went to buy it the other day, and I just have not yet. So good. He's gonna buy that stuff, right? Yeah. All right. Just don't know if there was a work around, and you're like, Oh, no, dude, here's what you do. Um I mean, I'll buy it. It's like 60 bucks. Oh, wow. PBS gives it away for free. What? Do you got some PBS connection? No, it was on PBS for a while. Oh, do you have cable or something? CNN. Okay. I don't even think you have to have cable. Oh, you mean like, um, like you just stream? Yes. You're up the creek. Yeah. I thought you meant No. You don't have to have cable to get PBS. You just like they help people in the world exactly as beams into your eyelids. You know what I was thinking? You have to stand there and hold like a coat hanger a certain way. And your TV and the other hand? Oh, sure, you can get PBS. I'm gonna buy it that it looks great. Why not? It is good. And I would say I would I would say it's worth roughly $60. It's pretty good. But anyway, Kris Kristofferson figures big into one of the episodes like it's not worth more than 45. Couldn't David right? Because it goes to Kem Burns, hairdresser. That's right. And that's a quite a collection of brushes that that person is to maintain, but Kris Kristofferson is interviewed like today, and how interesting he looks exactly like it. See now? Well, I tried to get him on movie Crush because he played the city winery, which is, like, attached to our building. Basically. So I will try and get people from over there on the basis of like, Identity was walk over the across the parking lot, right? His ah, his manager email me back and said the and this should hearten you as well said, I'm actually, it's stuff you should know, Fan No, the manager and said, But you know what? Um, he doesn't really do interviews anymore, So maybe I just got the easy that the easy pass, right? But, man, I really wanted that one to come through here. They were that dude in this office. It would have been pretty special. Yeah, but I'm lookin Burns. No. Who is Ken Burns? That's true. All right, let's talk about we take a break. Let's go back to Chuck a little bit. Let's get in the way back. Machine way, Theo, we're gonna go back. We even know exactly when we're going back to 1:30 p.m. On September 19th 1991. Whoa! 91. I'm I'm in college. It's a salad days. I'm wearing a flavor flavor clock around my neck. I was, ah, sophomore in high school. Yeah, that's all I have to say about that. I never wore the Flavor Flav clock, but any China let that be. Well, I should have. I was not cool enough, but I was listening to Apocalypse 91. No, I'm saying you shouldn't have admitted that. You didn't know. I know. Okay, But now I believe that, you know, I'm not that cool. You know, Aaron Cooper made a pretty awesome one of my favorite ones of all time was us is public enemy. And I think I'm flavor Flavin it. But you look like Chuck D And just be cool. It's a cool photo shop of us. Tried to get chucked. The movie crushed too. Did he play the city whiner now? But he lives in Atlanta. I didn't know that. And at least part time would he say he didn't say anything? Cause the management company I emailed so we don't manage him anymore. So it was just a dead end. I got you the chuck d if you're listening. Pon city market Let's talk about your favorite movie, right? And also shout out to Kris Kristofferson's manager. That's right, of course. All right, boy. We're gonna have to go back and edit all this out. Now it's 1:30 p.m. September 19th 1991 and we are hiking with Erica and Helmut. Simon. They're German, but we're hiking in the oats. All Alps in Italy? Yes, Between Italy and Austria. Like right on the board. It very close to the border. Um, and all this peak, the ah, the Simon's decided that a cz they were descending, that they would take a shortcut. And the shortcut took him through this past pastor crevasse. And in this little shallow crevasse, they said, Oh, there's a There's a dead body, there's a corpse. And you're like, What? I wa says We're there too, right? Yeah. And I said, it's right on time, boy, Right? Exactly. Um, yeah. This is great. So the thing is, they could see it was a cadaver. Like they could see the corpses back back of the head, arm hanging out. Um, and they just thought Well, we heard that there was a hiker that was recently killed. And that's probably who that is. We'll take a couple of pictures and go down and tell somebody who owns, like, the nearest lodge, right? And on the way down you and I are going like that was not a hiker that was recently killed. No. Even I knew that. Like, did you see that guy here? I super old. Here's a mummy, The Simon's Air Crazy and the Simon's We're not crazy, but I'm sure they were saying the same thing. They were decided your shot, right? So they some people went up. And I think within a day or two they went up to try to get this dead hiker who they thought was a dead hiker out. And they did a terrible job with it. Yeah, they used ski poles to chip away at the ice. They used an ice hammer to chip away at the ice. Um, damaged the body, but they think it's just like some hiker. Whatever, it will be fine. Quit a minute. Wouldn't cash it. Um, and this article makes it sound like he like the whole world or everybody who knew about this body just thought it was a modern hiker for, you know, a while until the body came down the mountain. That's not the case. One of the things that when they were getting this body out, the accidentally esque excavated was a copper headed ax. And word got out that there was an axe with this body, and that is really weird. And it was copper copper with like, a wooden shaft. And everything was clearly a very, very, very old acts. And so pretty quickly they realized that they were on to something here for sure. And when they found out, was this body Hi Frozen body? Yeah. One of my favorite Simpson's lines ever 5000 years old. That's the same like same little bit as when he goes Boom Pie time, Abe. Oh, the best. No, that was not a Ba Abe's buddy. What's his name? It'll come to me later. I'll say it. Another screaming. I'm there. I can picture him. The long appeared Phil coz right now. Oh, what is it I want to say Like Chauncey, you're Chalmers Is not that very similar that I look it Okay. All right, I'm gonna keep going. So they get this body out and, um, removed it on September 23rd 91. Sealed it up like he said fluid out of town in a wooden coffin to Innsbruck, the Institute of Forensic Medicine. And there's an archaeologist named Konrad Spindler there who said this body's at least 4000 years old? At the very least. What saves friend's name? Jasper. Big Glass for right? Yeah, of course. So they nicknamed then, uh, let's see, because of the region of the oats. Whole Alps. Very cute little name it is. Other people call him frozen Fritz. Really? Yeah, I like it. See? Way more notes. He's nice. Yeah. So, um, in pretty short order, they realized that what they had just excavated in the roughest, possible manner and accidentally come upon was the corpse of a 53 100 year old body. Yes, And when I said, the guy said it was 4000 years old. He said that was the initial like, he's at least this old right. Yeah, but it turns out that after further study, they figured out he was actually 5300 years old, right, and that he lived in the copper age, which was a relatively brief period in human history, but a really important one. Um, between the Neolithic Age, the end of the Neolithic age, when the first farmers started to appear and the Bronze Age when the first what we consider society and civilization in history began. Right. And we know very little about this. And what these hikers had discovered was a snapshot of life during that time because, let's see, Appeared to have just died worry for fell where he died, died where he fell. Yeah, that was almost there. Um, and leaving is his belongings with him. And it wasn't He wasn't like a great revered figure. He wasn't buried. He wasn't prepared. He was kept intact for 50 5300 years on this glacier. Yeah, that was the biggest deal because they have mummies and they have older mummies. But like you said, it's their organs were removed. They're filled with, you know, embalming chemicals and things they used at the time for preservation for the afterlife. And all this s o. This was a really big deal to find this body just really, really scare Lee, Well preserved. And when we say, well preserved It doesn't look like Kris Kristofferson, but any more? The organs were there. And Mike, didn't the red blood cells have still inside still intact? Yeah, it's the oldest intact blood sample ever taken. Um, Betsy's was so in. The fact that he wasn't buried provides a snapshot. It was a ritual ized. It was This guy was just living his life and he died and happened to be preserved perfectly. Belongings were preserved along with them and things that are organic and typically typically decay long before 5300 years comes and goes. So his clothing made of like different types of leather, preserved his his coder cape, made of woven grass, is was preserved. It was all really cool when you look at the shoes and the mayor skin had and right, very cool bearskin hat was another one. His tool kit was preserved. All of the stuff that we had like like just kind of little hints and traces and glimpses of from different, like burial caches, or just happen to find some artifact or whatever. This is like a straight up Polaroid picture of life in the copper. Yeah, it was almost like someone stumbled upon a museum of natural history display. But it was real, right, you know? Well, put, Chuck, you know who would love that analogy? Kris Kristofferson. Are you going to say either Jasper and I don't mean would've in the fact that he's dead? I mean, would of Heavy heard it. I agree. He's never gonna hear this. You never know. I'm, like, using reverse. That call again is the manager right now. Well, do you mind as well, Willie Nelson will never listen to these either. Neither world Dolly Parton. Yeah. We want all the country legends listening. Ronnie Milsap will never hear that. You still with us? Sure. Okay. Not with us, though, because he doesn't listen to stuff you should have. Never will. So, apparently, where where curtsy actually fell was pretty lucky, because it was in a very shallow crevasse. And the fact that that was, uh, kind of walled up on both sides of him kept him. If he was just out in the open, the freeze thaw cycle over the years would have washed everything away and ripped him apart. And it didn't happen because he kind of fell in this crevasse. Um, all five foot, two £134 of him. Yeah, which is Ah. 158 centimeters and 61 kilograms. That's right. He had brown eyes. Ah, apparently at five to was even a little short for the time. But he was ripped. Yeah, he was pretty sturdy. Ah, you know, in his mid forties, like we said And really strong legs. And, you know, kind of the fun thing about this is the archaeological forensics of trying to piece together. Like, What was he doing? How did he die? What we'll get to all that. But just the fact that, like, he had big legs, they were like, this guy. He's probably got herder. He's walking up and down these mountains all the time, right? Look, of those calves, Yeah, He looked like the guy from the one Liberty Mutual commercial. I don't know what you mean. It doesn't matter. Like 10 people this laughed. What else said he had He had a dagger. He had that acts you're talking about. The dagger had a wicker sheath. He had, um, a backpack. He had a leather pouch. Yeah, with the backpack. By the way, we'll never know how it worked because it got destroyed by the people who went in that really dug him out of the ice, gets, um, rudimentary snowshoes. Had a belt. He had had a belt that matched escape, right? Yeah, a man. And we'll talk about that. But apparently they think that was on purpose. Yes, that here's a bit of a fashionista. Yeah, Um, he had a couple of like, vessels that were lined with some maple leaves that he used to carry embers from place to place. So we didn't have to start a fire again. And all the stuff you like, I'm cool of Flint dagger, Cool copper axe. Oh, it's the members think it's all cool. I do, too. But I can see people out there being like, Ah, talk about math or something, right? The thing is, is like all the stuff that seems kind of boring and superficial has been so thoroughly studied that it's actually been used to paint a larger picture like we understand the copper age in Europe way better than we did before. It was discovered just from finding this the few things that he died with you and him himself, Hey, also, interestingly, had 61 tattoos all over his body. Chuck, I've been waiting for this day. What? You said tattoos correctly. Oh, you mean the tattoos? Anything. So, uh, yeah, and they were. They covered him from head to toe in different parts. And they didn't use needles back then, obviously. But they would rub or cut the skin open and then rub charcoal inside, and they're all They mapped him out in 2015 and organized them into 19 groups. And they are basically, you know, like maybe three identical lines. Short lines, like an inch long or like a cross. Not a spiritual religious cross. But, you know, like a plus sign. Yeah. Or like a Chinese character that has some inspirational association, right? Perseverance or something? Get a lower back tattoo authority branch. But yeah, they met these all out, and for a while, they thought, and some people still think because they were largely found around the joints and along his back, um, and he had back problems, and they he basically was marked up where he hurt. It looks like, right. And they thought it might have been either accupay puncture points to mark. Or it might have been the acupuncture treatment itself, right? But it does. They do think that it had something to do with acupuncture, which, in and of itself was a big revelation because they thought up to that point that acupuncture had been invented 2000 years, after etc and way further eastern in Asia. Right? But now they think that may not have been the case. No, because they found, um, a new cluster of tattoos on his chest that they didn't formally recognize, huh? And they were like, there are no of acupuncture points there, and he didn't have any injuries there. So now they they didn't throw it out with the bath water. But there are people now. They're saying, like, we don't know if that's true or not. No. Okay, so I'm really glad you said that everything that we know about it. See, aside from the fact that he is dead, that we have a pretty good idea of when he lived, right? Probably was height. Weight was stuff like that. Everything else is interpretation. Sure. So you have to educated interpretation, super educated and usually displaying the current understanding of history. or interpretation of history or events. But, um, it is still interpretation. That's part of archaeology, anthropology and history, especially when you're talking about prehistory. This is he lived during a time before anybody wrote anything down recorded anything which makes it prehistoric. But you just bear that in mind that everything we're talking about and everything you go read about C is very much described in absolute terms. Yeah, but it is our picture. An image of him, how he lived, how he died has really shaped in and shifted over the years since he was discovered. And it still is it still malleable. Nothing is definitive. Nothing set in ice. All right, let's take a break. The bad joke. We'll talk about this Earth sees health right for this, you know, check out. Some people are like, Oh, the holidays come earlier and earlier every year, like it's some sort of problem. Yeah, well, I would tell those people, chuck, that they need to try Make Cafe's new seasonal treats because they're going to get them in the holiday spirit. Right quick. That's right, man. We're talking warm, flaky donut sticks made fresh every morning sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, They are back, everybody. And now a new chocolate dipping sauce comes along with it. Delicious. Yeah, plus, let's just talk about the new cinnamon cookie lot. That's right. It's made with cinnamon sugar syrup hand stirred with milk and rich, freshly brewed espresso man. And then it's topped off with a Sprinkle of cinnamon. Yeah, it tastes like the holidays, and it's gonna put you in the holiday spirit. Warm up to the holidays with donuts sticks, now a chocolate sauce and the new cinnamon cookie lot on Lee from McCafe Good is brewing for a limited time only at participating McDonald's. Is he healthy? E. I mean, he was No, he was a person of age in his mid forties of a time where at that age, he's gonna be pretty beat up. Yeah, he wasn't unhealthy. And, like the modern sense where he's like deliberately wrecking his health because he's eating too much junk food or something like, you know, me, Yeah, but he was unhealthy in the way that a person would be unhealthy from living close to the land at a time before medicine had really developed exactly no doctors, no dentists. So as you would imagine he had gum disease, heart disease, Lyme disease, gulf gall bladder stones, hardened arteries, Gall stones. Yeah, the disorder. So nice. We named it twice, right. He had, ah, whip worm parasite in his gut. He had H. Pylori and his gut. Um, and all of this is to say, Like he said, he was probably a pretty normal dude of mid forties of the time. Ah, he was. They couldn't find a stomach for a long time. It's amazing how much of this stuff like it was found over the years. Like this tattoo. This new tattoo was just found a few years ago. Yeah, after, like many, many years of study. His birthmark that looks like Abraham Lincoln alluded people for decades, but they couldn't even find a stomach. And the family like, Oh, here it is. 20 years later, they found it wedged up between his ribs and his lungs. Yeah. Then they found it because the notice t i gall stones. So they basically traced the path from the gall bladder to the stomach and said, There it is, We found it and they were really happy. They found it because when necessary, to dissect it or take samples from it. They found that it was full. Yeah, he died like within an hour or so of eating his last meal and hadn't digested it. He had food in his in his colon. Ah, he had food and his intestines. He had a turtle head peeking out. Alright. What? His last meal was dried ibex and deer meat with Ah, I think Corn. Wheat? Yes. And slow plums. I don't know why that wasn't mentioned. You can get that same meal in Brooklyn served to you by a guy with a waxed mustache and like some sort of armband and armed gardener. So yeah, an armed guard her. That's it. That's it, isn't it? Yeah, that's it. Um, so he ate. They think some sort of like fatty cured meat. Kind of like a bacon, a cured bacon today. And the ein iron I corn wheat was from bread. Any also ate slow plums? Gotcha. Okay. Slow plums. Yeah, that they make sloe gin from Oh, really? Which I've never had, Have you? That's s l o e, right? Yeah, right. It's like I supposedly a very tart kind of bitter sh plum but it's It's like a load of vitamins. Never had it, remember? Ah, it seemed like a old person drink was a sloe gin fizz. Like an old person who's, like 150 years old. Yes, on when I lived in Arizona, there were All those snowbirds were down there. They drink like sloe gin fizz. Really? I've never been present when somebody ordered a sloe gin fizz. Yeah, I would like to try one. So sure. Try one. Okay, Josh, go get us a sloe gin fizzes, stat. Make it a double. I guarantee there's a bar in this dumb building that has a sloe gin fizz. If you're sure, you know, with arm garters, um, can I keep the armed guard? Comes with a drink. So let's talk a little bit more about the copper age, I guess. Um, he had Well, what will save his injuries for a minute here? Okay. We'll talk about a little about his lifestyle in the copper age. Like he said he was is demonstrated by his meals. He lived a pretty like, far me pleasant life down there. It seems like, but not one without conflict, you know? Sure. Based on his meals. Well, based on his meals, he lived a farming type lifestyle. But based on injuries, we're gonna talk about it seems like that, you know, he had some enemies. So from from what I saw and I mean, we used a lot of different articles, but, ah, National Geographic is very well represented in here. Live science history dot com the BBC. I came across something from the pen, uh, Pennsylvania, The pen museum or you pen museum. I think they have ah magazine called Expedition. That was pretty awesome. Had a pretty great thing. And I saw a couple of things from, um historians that road up basically descriptions of etc. And thought co. Which is This is surprising. Great resource. Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever noticed? Yes. Yep. So, um, in in one of these I saw that it was kind of put like he he lived as a farmer and enjoyed like, the the fruits of village life too. So things like cheese and processed grains and cereals. So bread and stuff like that. And the, um the idea is that he didn't know howto bake bread or make cheese. He looked He was part of a Villager society where somebody knew how to bake bread and somebody knew howto break make right. So the professions were starting to emerge but that he also was pastoral and that, like he he herded sheep. And that's probably what he did most of it most of the time. And then he also lived very close to the earth. The land as well, Like his last meal was wild game ibex in dear ah, and slow plums that he probably plucked himself. Yeah, he was kind of like this transitional human, Um, from the hunter gather passed into the agrarian, agriculture based future that spread out just ahead of them. Yeah, like just ahead of them were, like, real deal Italians out there. Yeah. Bacon baguettes. Yeah. You know, that's French. Yeah. What? I mean, Italian bread. Yeah, Yeah. In Italy, they just call it bread. That's right. Ah, they I mentioned earlier that his clothes matched and they do think and of course, again, this is all speculation. But these garments were pretty refined. Even when you look at him now, like he had these for skin leggings that were held up by suspenders by Alexander McQueen. Oh, man. I wouldn't saw that. I know that was amazing. So good. Um, in a great documentary on him, too. That's good. Inside, Uh, the, uh They talk about the color of the animal skins on the contrasting colors. They think we're actually matched, like, elaborately. And he had, like, like he said, a sense of style, like, you know, Is that possible? Yeah, but I mean, it seems like a lot to extrapolated that his coat and his belt matched and said they were like, Hey, we had a real personal identity, whereas And it could have been just like that's the materials that he had on hand that fit. That's possible. But I think what they're what they would assert is that, um it has enough panache. Yeah, that the chances of it just being random are very unlikely or less likely and being, you know, asserting his sense of fashion and, well, anyone's Italian. That's right. So, you know, Italians in their fashion go hand in hand, love. Everyone who's been to Milano knows that your fear ends, eh? I remember when I was touring Europe as a youth, my friend and I laughing at the Italian guys and the hostiles were like 19 year old dudes were so put together and, like, would spend so much time in the mirror wearing the cologne and getting their hair just perfect. Yeah, we were just disgusting humans. And, uh, they got the girls, so yeah, it turns out that they were on to something. A little bit of extra effort really did that. And the big hair. Yeah, they were great guys. So we met some cool Italian dudes. One of the other things, too, though, that the fact that he clearly was involved in a village, they think that he was associated with a particular village to the south, in a valley near you know, the mountains. Um, those things like bread and cheese that they think they found in his body. Um, but also, the fact that he did not He obviously didn't know how to make his own tools. Somebody else had, um he probably did not know how to weave the k. P. Was wearing. Somebody else had done that. Yeah, they're all they'll have their specialties. That Yeah, the tattoos. He couldn't have put some of them on his own body. he probably went to see a medical practitioner to do that. So, yeah, this is at a point when specialists and specialized professions are starting to emerge. It's really cool time. Yeah, and this is These are the things that we've learned from, you know, that we've gleaned from the stuff that we found with him. I think it's just astoundingly fascinating. Yeah, it's really cool. This is a really interesting period. I think of human development. It's also called, by the way, the copper age or the ah, chocolate thick like copper age. I do, too. Chocolate thick, just kind of coughs out of the mouth. And it Yeah. So let's talk a little bit about what might have happened to curtsy and how he found himself dead on that mountain. Okay, because there quite a few theories over the years. And like you said, even this week, they have ah, some more leads. But ah, he was wounded. He had a really bad wound on his right hand. They found out he was right handed too. So this is a big deal between his thumb and his forefinger There. That area went all the way down to the bone, but it looked like it had healed up a little bit. Um, so it probably happened. They said within a few days of when he died, but it was healing. But it was a big injury, like we said, because he was right handed. And But it's not the kind of thing that killed him. Like he didn't bleed out from that or anything like that. No. Uh, so, um, it makes you think well did kill him and right? Well, they think that might have been from a fight, Perhaps that wound that has been almost universally agreed upon from the outset, right, that he probably didn't inflict that wound himself. That it seems to have been a defensive wound. Right? There is a guy named Alexander Horn who's an inspector with the Munich Police s. So we should give just a little background for a second. When Italy was found, he was taken into Germany down the mountain in tow, or Austria, Innsbruck, Austria, and the Germans were heavily involved, a cz well, as the Austrians and the Italians were less involved. And that's where he kind of stayed for the first few years. I think about a decade or less after he was discovered and then eventually was transferred to Italy. The Italian side? Yeah, because they were like, he's the founder on our side. Yeah, like it just a Bailey, I think also. I don't know if this contributed to her if it came later, but he does seem to have been linked to the Italian side where, like you said he was in Italian, right s o. He was transferred to Italy. And when they when they took custody of them, man, they pulled out all the stops. They put him up in Bolzano, Italy, near about, I think, like, 30 miles or something from where he was found. They built a museum specifically for him. Sure. An institute bill around studying him, and they proceeded to study him more than any other mummy has ever been studied. Probably any other body then has ever been studying in the history of the world for sure have just turned out paper after paper after paper based on their findings from, um so But at first, some of the ideas that we have about, but seeing what happened to him come from the earliest interpretations. Yeah, posed by the Germans in the Austrians when they had custody of it. See right, which weren't necessarily right. As it turns out, no, but some may have been, but my ultimate point was, everybody says from the outset. That wound the wound in his hand was a defensive wound that came from close combat with somebody else. That's right. For a while, they thought there was an Austrian archaeologist named Konrad Spindler that I mentioned earlier that they sort of recreated the scene. And their contention early on was like, Man, that axe is leaning up against the rock. It's propped up there like we think everything is literally frozen in time from how it waas. And I think that's one of the things did they have later refuted. Right? And they said that it looks like things might have moved around some. Yeah, they think that the, um what would you call it? The site, I guess from the freeze thaw cycle. Just kind of distributed, redistributed this stuff. Yeah, which, you know, it's still all valid, but it not. It was not necessarily exactly as it was at his moment of death. Indeed, they did find his hat, though off of his head, as if it just, like, kind of fell off of his head, which might have been true, right? So some of the early stuff. They also found what they thought were fractured ribs that had not healed. Right? So the earliest picture was this, like they treated it like this is Ah, dead body mystery. Where did this dead body come from? How did he die? Yeah, but well, quickly, though they also found pollen in his gut that they thought came from an autumn plant. So they were like, he died in the fall. Right? Okay, so that's the full set up of the bad information. So the first idea and I think it was Spindler who came up with the, uh, the disaster theory was right. I think so. Konrad Spindler said, Okay, here's what happened, etc. He, uh, came down from the mountain probably hurting some sheep or goats in the fall. Went down to his village. Ah, and got in an altercation with somebody. Cut his hand. You're looking to my wife, right? That kind of thing. That's nice. Um, and he fled or oh, in part part of the altercation also resulted in some cracked ribs, right? And either fled or laughter. Escaped up the mountain again, where he became exhausted from his cracked ribs, right. And his cut hand and, uh, lay down or fell into this little shallow crevasse and died of exposure to hypothermia that raise the disaster theory. And that was that, You know? I mean, they had that for a few years, and somebody came along. Is that I don't think that's right. That's right. Um, because they found out some of the things like the site had melted some. And then things were in different positions. They originally thought, probably They examined the ribs again and said they were actually not fractured before he died. Yeah, they were just a little bit. Yeah, from like, after his death. Probably from the push of ice. The pressure from ice gazing on him again. Exactly. That little crack your ribs in a second share or bend your ribs. The big one, though, was what they found in the X ray in 2001. Right? You know what they found? Should we take a break? Oh, yeah. All right. We'll discover what they found right after this problems. It's human nature to hate problems. But why is that? After all, problems inspire us to mend things bend things make things better. That's why so many people work with IBM on everything from city traffic toe ocean plastic, new schools to new energy flight delays to food safety. Smart loves problems. IBM Let's put smart toe work. Visit IBM dot com slash smart to learn more. What did they find, Chuck? They found a freakin arrowhead lodged in his shoulder back shoulder. That was a verbatim quote from the press conference. This is a big deal. They missed it at that for 10 years. They missed this thing and they found it. Ah, yeah, it was just a regular X ray. And they said, Wait a minute. That looks denser than bone. Yeah, What is that? It's a triangle. It's a triangle. And it was a 13 millimeter gash along a major artery in his chest, and they're like he bled to death up there. Yeah, this area, he said There's no way he would have survived. This is unyielding. This this is finally what killed them. So this disaster theory that he got in all education, but ultimately died of exposure. Hypothermia, um, was replaced by the murder theory. Right, Which is very similar. But there's some important nuance. Is indifference is one. So the cracked rib thing. Just throw that away. There was a red herring. Um, but the altercation is still the same. He comes down the mountain, he gets in a fight of some sort, goes back up the mountain with his cut hand. And while he's hanging out, maybe tending to his wound may be trying to figure out what to do next. That's my arrow impression message for you, sir. Yeah. Yeah, right in the back, in the back, Right. From a distance. They think due to the penetration from the arrowhead from about 30 meters, Yeah, it's good shot, That is It is a good shot because it was a kill shot from 30 meters, 150 feet. That's a That's a ways. Yeah, um, I can't quite put it into an easy analogy, but that's a long but that's a long way. Yeah, um, and the fact that it was in the back, he never saw it coming. And it would have killed him pretty quickly as a punk move is what it wasit waas. Here's the thing because his possessions were left intact. Um, And because he had the defensive wound, Yeah, they think that this was the result of his death, as murder was the result of a personal conflict. There was no theft involved or anything like that, Right? Because his copper acts alone would have been pretty valuable at the time. And somebody would have taken it had they killed them for something like robbery. And so this was a vendetta? Yes. Were released. A personal fight that happened that day? Yeah. Or maybe a long standing feud. There's no way to tell. Here. Here we reached the point where the historians and archaeologists are like, we really can't say. But you're some ideas. Yeah, for me, it's either the person who he fought came back for revenge, I think, and this is a total guess, But I was trained in history, so I'm allowed to do that. Sure. He was trained in history. Yeah, I was. I studied history in college. That's what they call it. Uh, they're like this. How you do it. Train history camp, right? Um, he was successful in that hand to hand combat and killed the other person, whether it was offensive or defensive. I like to think it was defense if he didn't have a choice. Um, but the person's family came back and killed him upon the mountain. Gotcha. That's the current idea, Will not that last part. That was his family. But what I said leading up to that, everything about that, um, everything else about that. I'm really sorry. Kris Kristofferson. Um, that's the current idea of what happened, I think. Eh? So you're not going with my jealous lover theory? No. Okay. No, I'm not all right. I think it was a woman with that arrow. You think the woman a woman shot him? Yeah. Jealous lover. I think he was stepping out. Ah, and he was, like, hold up his hands like baby baby wouldn't me. And she slices him with Thea her implement of choice, and then dices, um, with the era. And then he's like, this is getting too serious. You're crazy. And so he heads up the mountains and she's like, I'll show you crazy. She turns into Glenn close. She goes in, forges an arrow and then in that time, it took her to forage that arrow from hardened molten. You know, Flint Flint, your shirt. He's up that hill a little bit, and she's, like, no problem. Watch this right in the back. I like that one too. All right, I'm going with family family, cause I mean, yeah, you know, the rule can't trust family trust family. So, um, speaking of that shirt ah, he did not have, um he didn't have blanks. Yeah. So this is evidence that he didn't know how to create his own tools. Replicate these tools which apparently were sort of on their last leg. Yeah, that was another thing, too. So he did not have what he needed. Like, imagine if you had, um if you had, like, a ah ah, tool an ex NOAA knife. Okay. And it's made of flint, and you use it over and over and over again. It's going to get worn down, and eventually it's gonna get so worn down that you just can't use it anymore. This is essentially the state of his arrowheads and his knife and some of his others is stone tools in particular that he was not in a position to defend himself with his own tools because he'd used them up. And I wonder if the if he's not making these in the village if they're like, uh, thirties, you know, he's have you guys noticed he's on the way out like we're not gonna be making it. More tools for tea. Yeah, I can see we don't have many. He it'll just make do with what? He's got it so But he owes me money. So should we talk about Moss? This was astounding to me that this happened in the last few days because did you pick this out before this happened? Or was it? Serendipity is what I saw that made me say it's time. Okay, I got you. So researchers found ah, these mouth spores that were inside of him that he had ingested and just on him and around him. Um, 70% of the 75 species of these Mosses and liver words were not local, and they basically said there's no way these would have been on the side of the mountain if not for him. Right. Like a bird couldn't have transported it this far. Something like that, Like the gutsy brought these up here. And so in doing that in the in, tracing, like these Mosses and spores and everything, they have a big clue. They've been able to retrace his steps that lasts basically 33 hours of his life the last day and 1/2 and it was not a great day and 1/2 for him. He had his hand wound by now. By the time we're coming in here, he's already got his hand wound. It's got to be smarting. And it's a real problem for him, too, because even if he could make tools, he would have been really troubled to do anything because he was right handed. And that's where his wound almost down to the bone was, was in his right hand. Yeah, that's a big problem for him right there. Yes. So what they found in his lower colon witches would have been the last. I'm sorry, the oldest stuff that he had eaten that has not yet been the turtle head, Not yet not turtle headed yet, or I guess currently two related, um, were pine and spruce pollen. So they said, and it's kind of neat. That's what I love about this, like historical forensics, like, Oh, well, we know what was in his body, and we know where that stuff is. Yeah, it's not at certain altitudes. It was, Ah, high altitude for us around 8200 feet. And they know because of where it was in his body. This is 33 hours before he died, all right? But the middle tract of his colon, that's what all the secrets are in the colon. Yeah. You know, had pollen from hot horn beam, huh? And that stuff from lower altitudes. It's from lower altitude, but also it grows only in the spring and summer. It decays very quickly. So it's not something that you would preserve and keep for the fall of the winter. Would throw out the autumn the eerie. Yep. So they say he definitely died in the summer, Right? And bring I guess that means that he probably descended maybe all the way to the bottom of the valley within 12 hours, maybe 9 to 12 hours of his death, and then all the way back up again, right where he was found dead and they figured all this out. They retrace all this just from those spores. And moss is amazing. They think maybe so he He's down in the valley to begin with her in the village, gets that hand wound fleas up to the tree line. Um, and then they think because he's like, the little lady always needs a few days to cool off. Right? Oh, means you're gonna get me a bill for that one. Um, I retract my right, by the way. Ah, so and then he goes back down. They think to get some moss is because they have Anna by bacterial properties. Yeah, you can also wrapped meat in it, right? Apparently. Take, I guess, keep it or whatever. But also they may, he may have wrapped his hand in it or something as well. Or maybe what? So a doctor, maybe. Then he goes back up to the tree to above the tree line where he dies at about 10,500 feet. That along the way he had that last meal of ibex and deer in bread and slow plums. Pretty good meal. Not bad. I wonder if he was panicked if he knew like I'm in a bad way because of this cut on my hand in my tools and arrowheads, Irv, not in good shape. I don't know, cause it's interesting. You only know that stuff from seeing it at that point in history. Like it would have been like, Boy, I've seen that kind of wound before on Oh, yeah, Tuck Tuck in. Yeah, he did not last long, but if you thought somebody was coming after you and you knew that your arrowhead was useless and your knife was like Dole and you're your stab in hand was cut to the bone, right? You probably wouldn't have had to have seen that before. To be like, uh, probably so Well, he was in full retreat from what it looks like, right? Yeah. That's what he was going up that mountain. That's that's That's what most people guess. Yeah. So he was probably scared. Yeah, which is said, but that's how we spend this last day and 1/2 kind of on the run up and down the mountain, which is pretty impressive, that he was able to make you know, he went up and down the mountain. Don't for sure. He was wearing moccasin stuffed with grass And he was old for the time. Sure. And he had Ginger Vitus. Uh, kind of a neat thing is they have found, um they found some weird markers on his male sex chromosomes. And they've actually traced some genetic relatives. At least 19 people living today. Yeah, in Austria are not married but related to it. Yeah, pretty neat. Yeah, I think so, too. So check. There's another theory that says, Hey, you know, your hold murder theory. It's B s that maybe the murder part is correct. But he was murdered. Ritually, this isn't a vendetta or anything like that. Let's see, was buried right. They think that this was, ah, ritual burial on top of a mountain. Um, but he you know, it's not the kind of maybe they just want a group that removed the organs and did that stuff, right? Yeah. So the premise of the the the burial theory called the social theory, is that he's not a snapshot of everyday life, right? That they didn't that he would have been so heavily laden with all of this stuff. Because we even say here he had a bow and arrow. You ever see a lot of stuff. Knife A hatchet. Um, he was wearing moccasins with grass. And they're kind of like, Seriously, that's the best. They could do it this time for hiking a mountain. That's the shoes. You're like those air a mountain hiking shoes at any point in history. Um, and the fact that, um, the shaft of the arrow was removed I think they point to Is that Yeah. You an example of the idea that he was, um, buried that he was killed ritually and buried in this? Oh, so they think the killing was a ritual killing two. Yeah. A sacrificial killing. Yeah. Oh, I didn't get that part. And the other thing is, they're saying, like, this stuff these fancy Alexander McQueen leggings that he wore that were basically the predecessor of later Hoesen, then some pretty nice stuff for a simple, like sheep herder. Is it to be wearing? That's what this is what? The social theory people are saying. Yeah, they're like, we think this guy was actually kind of important and that he was buried here, um, as a sign, a symbol and what they found. What they point to is that there's still a like monoliths that were carved in the late copper age. 1000 or 2000 years after etc. Because he was born in a two beginning of the copper age. Yeah, that are depictions of somebody dressed a lot like, etc. Yeah. And they think that these air like heroes and legends ancestors. And they're saying this guy's wearing what? These people were carving images of 1000 years later. Yeah, maybe he was kind of important. And maybe this is a baby. Also had some ornamentation too, didn't he? Yeah, like a marble Be Yeah, which, you know, could mean something or could not. But the fact that he had so much stuff with him does kind of support the idea that maybe it was a burial. And then you send them into the after life with all the things he would need, right? Exactly. And then the other one is No one's ever explained how he was so well preserved that apparently being frozen by ice doesn't doesn't cut it. Really? Yeah, that that other people have been found who died far later, and we're in way worse states of decay. Then it's iwas. But they found no, Like chemical preservation, no evidence or anything? No. And admittedly both sides. If either one of them were being honest, they will say we don't know how he was this well preserved. Quite a mystery. Still to this day, as much as we know about him, he is still a mystery. He's our love and mystery man. That's right. If you want to know more about, let's see go type o T z I and your favorite search bar. And it will bring up some fascinating stuff and insisted that time for listening. Man, I'm gonna call this the accidental Iron Man. Hey, guys, Big fan. For a long time, I accidentally I did my first iron Man in July 28 Dean. And you might think, how in the world would that happen? I was thinking, Exactly. Here's how that happens. I've been doing triathlons since 2015. Always planned on doing an Ironman at one point, or at some point, my plan was to do 1/2 iron. Man in 2018 did the full thing in 2019. I wanted to do the Iron Man like placid, since it's reasonably close and as a lake swim as opposed to a river or in ocean swim. Okay, that's a hard race to get into the cells out so fast. I got an email from the registration was open and in my excitement I miss read it and thought it was for the half. So I signed up and realized after the fact that it was the entire 140.6 race and not the 70.3 triathlons don't do refunds. So I paid my $800 plus entry fee and couldn't get it back. I could have deferred for a year, but it's decided just to go for it. And I finished the race in 15 hours, two minutes and 43 2nd Nice to work, and that is from John Patan Yak and email John back in. It's like you wanna give me a couple of little tidbits here for listener Male, he said. Sure, and he wrote back. And he said, One thing I can say is it really takes over your personal life. At my peak, I was training 20 hours a week, and he said, that is literally just pool, bike or running, he said, doesn't count travel to and from the gym, cooking meals, prepping equipment, he said. It's a literally like a part time job. And he said the race was a lot of fun. He said the Lake Placid course goes through the old Olympic structures from the 1980 Olympics, and you finish at the finish line and the speed skating oval. Oh, yeah, it's pretty cool. It's like urban exploration. Uh, and he said, One of the cool things they do If you're first timers, you wear an orange wristband s. So all the volunteers and crowd will give you extra support and it says I will become one on it. And he said It really works. And he said, And finally, in the end, the race is so meaningful to so many people. Everyone has their own story. But almost nothing is better after a year of training than hearing you are Iron Man. When you cross the finish line Thought they have Ozzy singing it, I would I would too. Who else? I don't know. I guess D Okay. Can that is John Petunia Dio is dead. Oh, is he? Yeah. Ronnie James Dio has passed on Since when? Within the last couple of years. Okay, Yeah, one of the coolest tattoos have ever seen. Somebody got like on there, arm their forearm. Seen that so that when they make like the devil horns or whatever, it's Ronnie d'oh making the devil horns and the person's fingers like his armor. Come see your arm. Yeah, it's really need. It is astounding. I saw that and I thought, Man, that's the coolest tattoo overseas. I think it might be. It's pretty. Hats off to Kris Kristofferson, manager, who actually is the person with that. That's right. Uh, if you want to get in touch with us like, Who is that? John Petunia. Thanks, John.

Chuck Bryant Here on a lovely Saturday morning in Atlanta, Georgia. We're going back in time to February 18th 2014 to talk about salt. Our episode, how Salt Works is one of my all time favorites. I love salt because I'm from the South. Probably like a little too much, he asked my doctor, but that salty, salty goodness on food just makes it all pop for me, but has a really cool, interesting back story how you get salt, a harvest salt and how salt works on food. Learn all about it right now. Welcome to step. You should know a production of my heart radios. How stuff works that way with podcasts on Josh Clark and the Charles W. Chuck Bryant. And this is stuff you should know podcast. Oh, yeah. Jerry's over there. So Laffy today for some reason. Old salty dog, She Why did salty calling someone salty? I wonder where that came from. I meant to look that up. So when I didn't look up? Yeah, because you know your salty mood. Yeah, I've said that. Plenty. On what if that comes from like a salty dog Here. Here. This is my idea. Okay, so salty. Describe somebody who is a little coarse. A little rough around the edges. You hear me out? Uh, because their faces usually puckered into, like a ah sour puss face. Yeah. And what makes your face pucker? Eating salt. So they're salty person. Okay, I would call them Lemony. Well, s o take something with a grain of salt, actually. Ancient. That's from the Romans. Okay, Um, they would take poison with a green assault or something that was hard to swallow with a grain of salt to make it go down more easily. Okay, let's go ahead and cover these, then somebody not being worth their salt. In this article, it says that, um, slaves were traded assault. And if you got your hands on like a slave that wasn't worth much like that he wasn't worth his salt. Is that not the origin I found? The first reference in print came from an 18 05 description or book about an expedition to Guinea Bissau, and it mentions a guy who wasn't worth his salt is a good man. Peter Hale H A Y l e Um, but he wasn't worth assault, the guy said, and I looked it up, and I couldn't find that whether Hale was hired or was a slave. But I got the impression that, um, what the guy was talking about wasn't that he had traded salt for Hale but not worth assault, like in his body. No, he was not worth the salt meaning of salary. Which supposedly salary is rooted in the idea of paying someone in salt. Yeah, Same with soldiers. Saul Dari ends to give salt salad to the word salad comes from the word salt. Really? Yeah, currently. So assault is Ah, it's ah, it's an important thing. Historically speaking, there's been economies largely based on salt. There have been, um, cultures rated by other cultures because of salt. Um, if you were an ancient salt producing area. Probably the rulers controlled with the tight grip. Um, that salt production insult distribution? Yeah. Um and that actually carried on into the modern age when the when Great Britain was occupying India. They had a tight control on salt production there. Um and actually, Gandhi started Ah, revolution or helped along the revolution to overthrow the British Imperial power Through assault protest, he walked 240 miles to the coast, where the salt production facilities work and grabbed a bit of salty clay and boiled It boiled the salt out of it, which was an illegal act. Yeah, And that protest spurred other similar protests. And the British were like, Oh, you can't do that, mate. You can't mind your own salt, right? But he did, because he was Gandhi was called the Salt march to Dondi. By God, I got it. Uh, yes, All dates back to the 60 50 BC, and they actually found evidence of salt trading in pre historic times. So obviously it's used to spice food is great, but it's used to preserve food was super valuable. Yeah, back in the day and still today, because salt is one of these things you remember. Nature loves homo Stasis. It loves balance. Oh, yeah, If you introduce salt to the mix, it kind of throws off that balance. So to gain home, your state's assault is introduced into, say, meat. It likes to go into the meat, Yes, but it also draws out the moisture. Whether it's blood, water, whatever. Yeah, so it dries out the meat. It introduces the salt and it draws out the moisture. That's right. That's called curing, which preserves things because anytime bacteria comes in contact with that salty meat from that point on, the bacteria boom gets dried out and dies. Yeah, that's why package foods are still loaded with sodium. Yeah, unfortunately, I got some stuff on that later, but ah, it was used as a currency in Ethiopia up until the 20th century and was used as a form of suicide in China. For nobility, they would o. D on salt and kill themselves. Oh, yeah, because it was expensive and very valuable. So nobility. That's like it was like a noble way to go out. And we'll talk in a minute, like what happens when you have too much salt. It's not very pleasant. It's not very pleasant, but, you know, in medieval Europe, member, we did the 10 Medieval Torture Devices episode. Well, we skipped one, called the goats tongue. And it was apparently a real thing. A tickle torture. They would dip your feet of water bringing a goat, and the goat would lick the bottom of your feet, and then they would dip it again. And from that in the Arctic description, No. Okay, I'm saying, like, it wasn't in there. Um, from the description. Apparently being tortured, tickle tortured was not pleasant. I would love to have my feet like to buy a goat. They would do it until you did not love it. That was the point of the goat's tongue toward. Sounds like fun to me. Yeah. Ah, In the Middle Ages, salt was transported along the notorious old salt route, and I more than Germany. I know what I'm gonna get you for Christmas. Now go in some salt water. I've have had both at the same time. I don't know. I didn't think about it. Uh, play this big role in early America as well. Yeah. Massachusetts Bay Colony had the first patent to produce salt here in the colonies. Yeah, saltwater in the colonies. And ah, they did so for 200 years, the Erie Canal opened primarily to transport salt. Yeah, they called it the ditch that salt built. Really? Huh? That sounds like something just made up. No, I swear. I've been on the area. Canal aria? Yeah, they have this nice system of locks. Sure. And, um, they used to There's still, like, donkey trails where the donkeys used to pull these little flat bottom boats that would carry salt and whatnot. And now yuppies walk along those trails Jog Yuppies are there still yuppies? Oh, yeah. Thanks. Yeah, I heard one the other day. Ah. Dual income, large dog owner. All right. In the early 1800 salt was apparently four times expensive his beef because it was valuable, obviously. And we were a lousy with beef. And in civil war, salt played a big part in the union strategy. There were quite a few battles fault over capturing salt works in salt mines. Yeah, in Salt Ville, Virginia. Yeah, that's I don't know what they do there, and it actually had a big effect. The salt shortage on the Confederate troops. Yeah, not just the troops, but the people behind the lines back in the Confederate states were like, We want our salt when they had a huge impact on moral. Apparently, I would say so. And the reason why Saul is so important. If you haven't gotten the impression that it is important by now, you should rewind the podcast and just listen to the last several minutes over again. So is extraordinarily important, because the human body requires it. It's something that we need to survive and to live so much so that we actually have a taste sense for it. Yeah, it's the only you don't need bitter toe live no or sour. No or Mommy. As a matter of fact, things like bitter and sour are there, I think, to detect things that we shouldn't be eating. Sure, salt is to detect something we need. That's right. And we can actually, this is so mind blowing to me. I love the human body. I think it's amazingly wonderful in ways that we don't even fully understand yet. But consider this when you need salt. Yeah, your body produces a craving in you four Salt. Yeah, that is awesome. Like I'm one of those believers. I I don't follow it necessarily myself. But in a diet, well, nothing. But in a diet where you just eat what you crave, right? I think you could go off the rails because I think that we were afraid the wrong things. Now, Yes, now. But if you could go back 150 years yeah, maybe. Sure, I would bet you could survive pretty easily and thrive on a diet where you were just kind of led by your cravings like, Oh, I need to Meg's running a couple eggs have great things like Take, you don't know You should pay attention to yourself. Listen to what your body is telling you and I'll bet you find that you do have specific cravings for specific mood. I listen foods that air like very simple meat like Chuck going to stake Chuck, go eat some eggs like things that are basic staples. I'll bet you'll notice you have cravings. Salt. Uh, let's let's break it down chemically. Okay, um, it's sodium. And chlorine are the two basic elements in salt. I think we all know this, which are electrolytes. That's right, and we'll get into that in a minute. Um, sodium is ah, silvery white metal. And it is neither one of these air, like, super friendly independently of one another? No. You know, like, um, especially corny. Yeah. Sodium reacts violently if you mix it with water and oxidizes an air Chlorine existent gas in a room temperature. They're both really volatile. But when you put them together and you have sodium chloride and make beautiful music Thanks. Beautiful. Hal, I TTE. Ah, and beautiful music. And sodium chloride is about a 60 40 mix. Sodium chloride, by the way. Is that right? Yeah. Nice. It makes little cubes, right? Yeah. Like is that the molecules are cubicle, right? The sodium packs in pretty tight, and then the chlorine fills in the rest, and they make a tiny little cubes. It's actually reversed. That's what I said. Yeah, chloride is packed, and then the sodium fills in. But you know how I thought I thought the sodium was bigger. Well, um, but what you have is any CEO. That's right. And you mention electrolytes, those air minerals that conduct electricity in our body and our fluids and tissues, which is very important. So ever important. Like his muscle movement, we run on electricity. Heart contraction. Yeah. Involuntary muscle. Um, moves through electrical impulses, I guess. All muscles. Do you want your eyes to blink, buddy? Yeah, eat some salt. Right. And so there's two conditions that you can have. Conceivably. Well, 33 would be just All systems are normal, but the other two is too little salt and too much salt. Too little salt is called high podiatry. Mia. Yeah, that's what that lady died of. The, uh, hold your wee for a week contest. Oh, is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Um, you can od on water. And I guess that's what you would ultimately die from this hypo Nutri Mia? Yeah. What? Their water toxicity. Um, if you have too much water, you probably have too little salt because water flushes salt from your system. It's the method that kid your kidneys use to maintain the balance of salt and other electrolytes in your body. And that's why you might drink Gatorade if you're working out because it has electrolytes in it, right? Exactly right. They salty. You don't wanna water your crop land with it, though. none. As we found from the movie Idiocracy. Yeah, and actually found to that in the 19 eighties, there was a lot of controversy over salting roads killing. Ah, roadside vegetation. Well, yeah, for sure. I mean, like that If you were in the conquests in that kind of thing. Yeah. And you wanted to make sure that the land you just occupied couldn't be used to grow crops to feed the opposing army army. You would plough the land with salt, salt, the earth, which is not the salt of the earth. Because that means you're good fella, right? Yeah, but not a good fella, because those guys are salty. Wow, look at you know, that that was a team effort was clever. Word play, my friend. Ah, if you take diuretics, um, or you have, like, massive diarrhea for a period of days or vomiting or some sort of stomach bug. Ah, you might be at risk for Ah, hyponatremia. Yeah, because you're flushing out all of this. All their electrolytes. Yeah, this assault that your body needs. So if it's out of balance, you're going to suffer things like, um well, in an ability for your heart to beat, which is often fatal. Yeah, kidney problems. Yeah. Um, on the other hand, you can have hyper new treatment, which is too much salt. And like you said, if you're a Chinese aristocrat, um, you may die from hyper Nutri Mia. Yeah, they even had Ah, I am, man. Sometimes a blanket on word how to manual. Well, it's sort of like how many grams of salt you needed per pound in your body. They like a chart, I guess. Yeah. If you want to kill yourself and China is, here's how you do it. Yeah, there's some insult you need. Yeah, but that was rough. Is he like that? Yeah, I'm off today. No, You know, I'm a little off. You're on my microphone just swerved to the left. That has ever happened. There's a ghost in here. Um, so too much sodium. I think you said already is hyper Nutri Mia instead of hypo. You're hyper hyper hyper. Oh, exactly. It's like glassy mia, but with no tree. Mia. Exactly. And with hyper and a tree mia. Basically remember how salt if you, um if you, uh, introduce it to say a jerky of some sort it will dry it out or slug Yes, which is a shameful thing to do. Don't do that. Um, if you introduce it to a meat or something like that, it's going to dry it out. Because through offs, Moses in search of homo Stasis, Um, it does the same thing to your blood and your extra cellular fluids. That salt will draw out the fluids in yourselves. Yeah, but will maintain it in your blood. It's water retention. Basically, Yeah, Your kidneys. When has too much salt to deal with Kicks it around the blood supply just like remember in the hangover episode. Yeah. When you why drugs are so fatal. When you drink a lot of alcohol because your kidneys are trying to process, you're, ah, the alcohol. So it keeps the drugs just going around and around in your blood supply, right? Same thing with too much salt. If your kidneys have too much to deal with, they just keep the excess going around in your blood. And since that salt is drawing out all the excess moisture, it increases the volume of your blood, which makes your blood pressure rise, which makes your heart beat harder yes, which, supposedly, logically would put you at risk for a stroke or heart attack. And that's how you would die from hyper and a tree. Me? Yeah, I have high blood pressure. Well, supposedly sodium. Cutting your sodium down isn't gonna help. Yeah, there's a lot of conflicting data on that, for sure. Um, what will get the nutrition will cover that. Hey, friends, we want to talk to you about the future of phone service because it is here and it's called visible. Yet for 40 bucks a month, all in you get unlimited data messages and minutes on Verizon's four G l T E network and Visible doesn't do annual contracts. They also don't do shady hidden fees or foot long phone bills, either. When they say 40 bucks a month, they mean 40 bucks a month. Yeah, and when they say unlimited data that means unlimited data. They also don't have physical phone stores. That means no waiting in lines or dealing with annoying sales. People with visible you can sign up by a new phone or bring your own device. Get help that's a tap away via chat text or tweet and get better phone service, all from their app or website without ever leaving your couch. Yep. So are you ready to learn more? Switch to visible than head too visible dot com slash stuff and get $20 off your first month of service. An exclusive special offer just for stuff you should know listeners that's visible dot com slash stuff. So we chuck um, there. Like you said, there's a lot of controversy over how much salt or how little salt you should have on a daily basis in your diet. Yeah, um, the heart, National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute say no more than 2.4 grams of sodium about a teaspoon per day. Americans, they found, consume an average of about 3.4 per day s. So that's one gram too much on average. And, um, you actually don't need more than about 1/2 a gram a day. If you want to maintain that Stasis you so yeah, just for your electrolyte intake. The thing is, though, um, there was for many years because it makes sense that if you're if too much salt increases your blood pressure, then too much salt should be, um, should put you at risk for strokes and heart attacks, right? Yeah. Well, the CDC panel surveyed material and did an all sorts of studies that found no cutting your sodium intake doesn't really doesn't decrease your risk of heart attack or stroke. And, as a matter of fact, there is. Was it just more hereditary? They don't know what it is, Okay? They just know that basically below 3000 grams for 3000 milligrams of salt and above 7000 milligrams of salt a day were two groups that were at higher risk of heart attack. Okay, so if you have too little salt, you're a higher risk of heart attack, too. Okay? So try to keep it between, uh, 7000 milligrams 3000. 7000 7000. The thing is, they they don't there weren't comfortable making any recommendation. They were descending. Scares is what we found. Everyone's scared, like, go on the record. Yeah, because we just don't know. Like, it doesn't make any sense that you would have a heart attack if you ate less than three grams of salt today. Yeah, that that flies in the face of conventional wisdom, and nobody's figured out. Why yet? Interesting. Well, something should monitor the very least because I think a lot of people look at fat grams and calories and all that stuff is great to look at nutritionally. But when you start poking around on the soup can and you see Wow, this chicken noodle soup has 890 milligrams of sodium. So good in this one little can, which is almost a gram of sodium. Yeah, close to it. 1/4 pounder with bacon and cheese. You didn't do big Macs. Now. Should it have been met? You Communist, I think. Big Macs. Actually, I did. See, this is 1440 milligrams. A big Mac, I think, was around 1100. Wow. Pounders more with the bacon, I think. Oh, ads. They have, like, a whole bacon onion ranch or something topping that you can put on quarter pounders. Now. I've not yet tried this, but, like I think about it from time to time. Like right now? Yeah, right now. Especially, uh, So, at any rate, just give it a look. Like soups are notoriously high in sodium package foods are notoriously high in sodium. Um, don't just think about the table salt that you use. Like I didn't solve my food that much today, Feed a lot of packaged food, read a lot of sodium. Yeah. And nobody can tell you how much you should be eating or shouldn't be eating. But like you said, it's good to just pay attention to that kind of thing because you probably are eating a lot more than you realize. And you should be in a lot of packaged food. Anyway. I'll just go and say that. So, um, Chuck? Yes. What kinds of salt are there? Well, first of all, I should say, I love salt. Are you to salt pepper? My favorite to spices. I'm from the south. Have a taste for salt. Um, And pork fat? Yeah, that's pretty Southern, too. Yeah, for sure. Ah, so I love salt. Like good meditating sea salt. That's what he used at my house. Ah, and I'm gonna plug this local salty. Eh? I just made that word up. Oh, later in the show. Okay. But, um, I'm a big salt fan. I like salt too. I like sweet. I like you, Mommy. I like, um Sour. I'm training myself to like bitter through the use of Campari. Yeah, like I found out that I'm a bitter super taster. So, like things that seem like normal, the other people are, like, really bitter to me, Like you. One example. Grapefruit, Campari. That's better. Yeah, but it's like like, disgustingly bitter to me. Like, I can't understand how the rest of humanity eats grapes, but I don't like grapefruit. Well, maybe you're a bitter super tester tube. You anybody? But I have to tell you this. I've trained myself to like, um, grapefruit and come party just by exposure. Like I've come to appreciate him more. It's come party. It's a bar. Ah, think a bitter ah d just e for effort, Chief. Okay, you do like a compartment. So it's in a negroni, right? Oh, I think I've seen people like if their stomachs upset or is that bitters and soda? That boy welcome party is a type of bidders. Okay? It's not that super compact bidders write or Angostura, but it is a type of bitter. I think it's a digestive. Okay, It's good stuff. Anyway, I like salt. What I'm really saying there is I like, well seasoned food And if you're a chef or ah, home Chef, you know that salt is important to cooking. Super important and baking, Obviously, but bland food can't do it. No. What's the point? What is the point? Agreed types of salt. We'll start with table salt and listen, man, if you if your doctor put you on like a bland food diet Yeah, I feel for you. But there's stuff out there. You can eat there, Spike. There's Mrs Dash. There's You should be seasoning your food to some extent. Sure, like bland food is like it's bland life. Yeah, they even have the imitation salt to the new new salt. I didn't do any research on that, but of bought it before you. Do you like it? I didn't use it that much, but it's exist in my home next to the empty thing of Mediterranean Sea salt. I got you. Yeah, All rights, the table, salt. The 1st 1 We should cover this. The traditional. Um, either. I owed eyes for non iodized, fine grained salt that you see in many, many homes in restaurants and its eye dies. It did a little research into this. Did you look up iodized salt. Yeah, well, I mean, I know that they added it because at one point, it was sort of like fluoride. They thought, Well, we need this in a good place to put us in salt. Yeah, because most people use salt, and we'll just put it in the table salt, because it's an easy additive. But, um, there was a real problem with hyperthyroidism. Things like gliders, mental retardation. Um, just poor fetal development linked to you, Um, iodine deficiency. So they put it in salt. And apparently it's considered to be responsible for this thing called the Flynn Effect, which there was, like, a three point rise in the middle of the 20th century in Western nations. And nobody could figure out what it is. And they think now that it was because they added iodine assault. Really? And so it had the aggregate effect of raising our I Q By preventing poor fetal development, huh? Yeah, well, it's still a problem in other parts of the world. Just not here in North America, right? Other parts of the world that don't have iodized salt, you know how dumb they are coming. That was terrible. Just kidding. You need to apologize to the rest of the world. I'm sorry. Everybody s so like I said, table salt is the most common salt. Ah, they remove all the impurities, um, have things in there to make it, not clump and stick together. And so it porous, Really? So even when it rains, it pours. Well, should we get to that dance? You have something? Yeah, Um, I just for some reason thought of the Morton salt girl. And like, every great advertising story, they were like, how do we sort of a new thing at the time in 1911 to package salt this way in a container with a spout? How they package of before? I don't know. Big blocks probably is all right. Like a deer lick or something. I'm not sure, actually, but I know that this was a fairly revolutionary product to package it like this and process it like this. Um, So the agency was, um, n w Ayer and company. And Don Draper walks in and says, I've got 12 proposals for you. Which one do you like? And Sterling Morton of the Morton Company. Of course, it's always someone else like his son or his wife or something. It was his son and secretary. Um pointed toward one of the ads with a little girl holding the umbrella and said, This is the one. And he said, You know what? I think you guys were right. The whole story is right there in the picture because the whole point was this. Salt doesn't clump. When it rains, it pours right. And girls can't be trusted to be sent to the store by themselves because they ruin all the salt by keeping the nozzle open on the way home. Ah, some of the different slogans they had. What's flows freely? Runs really pours. It never rains, but it pours. And then they finally settled on. When it rains, it pours. Yeah, that's best one because it never rains. But of course it's in Guinea sense. They probably fired that person, and she's been updated. 12345 times. Really? Yeah, the last time in 1968. And she's been the same since then. Yeah, and there was never a real model for that girl. That's a question. They often get totally made up. Yeah, because he was like It's Morton's granddaughters. What? You know you want to think, Selma. It's so Morten. So that is the story of the air scheme. That's an old timey name. If ever there was one. Her scheme? Yeah, that's a college, right? No, it's like a person's name is. Well, it's a college D'oh! Okay. Not offended. Played soccer there. Erskine e r s k i n e. There's a college name. Colgate, too. It's like crazy to may. Ah, see, Salt, sir, is next, uh, gonna cost you some more money because of several reasons, One of which, if they go old school and in some parts of France, they still harvest this stuff. My hand, which is pretty cool. You might see it called Flared decell, which is French for flower of salt. And, ah, it's not processed like table salt is. So you're gonna have a lot of this trace minerals. It's gonna course and flaky and colors that too. It can for sure. Like you can have white sea salt in a pink black grey. Yeah, or combination of them pink salt air traditionally associated with Himalayan salt. Yeah. Um, and the pink is often for the result of things like copper or iron. Yeah, Or apparently, um, there's a type that contains an algae assault tolerant algae, which would make it an extreme of file. Um, that gives it has the beta carotene pigment in it, and that gives it a pinkish hue at salt interest. If the years you you're eating algae pink algae in yourself, it's pretty neat. That is pretty neat. And that's Hawaiian, right? A lot of times, Hawaii has a different one in al L l A. Uh oh, I read. That is algae. Yeah, I did, too, a couple of times. And I was like, Why would they separate these two out? There's no G. No, it's Ah, Hawaiian allay. Assault has iron oxide in it from the volcanoes? Uh, yeah. Makes sense. And who I also produces black salt, too. From the lava? Yeah, in a little bit of charcoal. I have to try some of those, actually. And yeah, and then there's grey salts to, um, which is Ah, there. Cell. Agree, which is from France, and then smoked. Salt is also great where they just take some salt and smoke it. Yeah, they put it over a smoky fire and you have smoked salt. Do you like Smokey Foods? Sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. Could be a little overbearing for me. It done? Yeah. In the hands of you know, I guess somebody who knows what they're doing with the smoked It's like I like a good smoked meat while day. Sure type of thing, but not necessarily Like, uh, you know, when the ad like artificial smoke, uh, in the kitchen to it to a meal right now I'm saying, Yeah, although smoked cheese is good. Oh, yeah, man. Good smoke. Hey. And thanks to fan Hillary, lows are from sitting a set of some great cheese. Yeah, I have a very good to you. Add some of that smoke duty yesterday. Actually, when I got home, I haven't had yet. Is it good? And as soon as I walked in the door, I got a knife out. Yeah, it was like I got to try. This stuff is delicious. Anyway. Thanks, Hillary. You know, Chuck out. Some people are like, Oh, the holidays come earlier and earlier every year. Like it's some sort of problem. Yeah, well, I would tell those people, Chuck, that they need to try make Cafe's new seasonal treats because they're going to get them in the holiday spirit. Right quick. That's right, man. We're talking warm, flaky donut sticks made fresh every morning sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. They are back, everybody, and now a new chocolate dipping sauce comes along with it. Delicious. Yeah, plus, let's just talk about the new cinnamon cookie lot. That's right. It's made with cinnamon sugar syrup hand stirred with milk and rich, freshly brewed espresso man. And then it stopped off with a Sprinkle of cinnamon. Yeah, it tastes like the holidays, and it's gonna put you in the holiday spirit. Warm up to the holidays with donuts sticks, now a chocolate sauce and the new cinnamon cookie lot on Lee from McCafe Good is brewing for a limited time, only participating McDonald's. So chefs and Gorman's will say sea salt is what you want to be using because you're gonna get a unique flavor from those minerals that are not in table salt. Sure, I agree with him. It's tough to bake with the yeah, it's tough to measure. You get a lot more precise, measuring for sure from table salt, right, and they don't recommend you bake with sea salt? No, because baking is a specific chemical reaction. Cooking is different. Yeah, they say that most chefs don't cook with sea salt, but they will just add it as a topper. But I've cooked with sea salt, and I know plenty of chefs that cook with sea salt. Yeah, so I disagree with it. Well, with the topper, they mean like, it's a finishing salt. It brings out, like all the flavors. If you Sprinkle it on. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely for you. Serve it. But I've also seen it used in the food, right? So, well, that leads us to kosher salt. Apparently, some people like to cook with kosher salt. If you are using following a recipe and you're switching out that whatever amounts of castles is called for, you want to double it because kosher salt is larger, coarse grain salt and here, to me, is a fact of the podcast. One of several kosher salt is not necessarily kosher itself. It's used to make things kosher. You didn't know that I didn't. I thought kosher salt was like salt that had been blessed by a rabbi or something. Really? Yeah, I never understood it, but now I do. It's it's salt. They used to make things kosher. If youse table salt to make something kosher, it's not gonna work, right. Kosher salt, because large and coarse grained, uh makes me eat kosher by drawing the blood out is eating blood ain't kosher. Yeah, so if you salt it with kosher salt, it's going to draw the blood out of the meat and, bam, you have a kosher cut, a steak baby boom. And it's not iodized either, right? By the way, um, and then we have the red headed step child of the salt Family Rock salt, which is used. Um, it's got a lot of impurities, its unrefined. It's very large brained, and it's used to melt ice on roads and sidewalks and to make homemade ice cream. Yeah, and probably some other stuff. But do you know of any other uses? I think Rock Salt, e's and, um, some chemical productions that makes sense. Yeah, um, if you want to make a good industrial brine rock saltier your man Yeah. All right. Salt mining until you get salt. Because it is a natural thing that exists in the Earth. Um, the largest producer of solved these days. No surprises. China. In 2012 they produced about 65 million tons. The U. S. Is not too far behind at 44 million. Then you've got Germany, India and Australia is the other leading top five salt producers these days. Yeah, and India gets to profit from insult production thanks to Gandhi. I guess so, huh? Yeah, that's pretty neat. And think about that. Their number four on the list. Yeah, And they weren't even allowed to produce it. Not so long ago. No, they were like to produce it, But already money went it. Yeah. Okay. Jerks. So Ah, there's three types of mining main, three main types. There's deep shaft mining. Ah, solar evaporation and solution mining and deep shaft mining is basically like any other type of mining where you just, um, drill a shaft down into a mine. Yeah. Which an underground seabed is what? Where the salt is, right. That's where you get your salt. Um, yeah, that's nothing. That's one of the facts of the podcast. Yeah, they're ancient underground seabed ancients. Yeah, it's that dried up and the salt remained and they formed. Um, these basically salt deposits that can be dozens or hundreds of feet thick. Yeah, and massively wide. And you drill down into these things, you create a couple of shafts, and then they usually use what's called a room and pillar system. Yeah, which really helps. It's very difficult to explain, but if you see a picture of it, it makes perfect sense. Agreed. But, um, you're basically creating a checkerboard pattern going down in mining the salt deposits. So you're leaving out a room, right? Yeah. You blast a room, but you leave ah, couple of adjacent rooms for support, right? And then eventually you've mined out all the salt, and then you fill it with industrial waste. Yeah, that is one thing. They dio deep shaft mining. Yeah, and they'll remove this out there and crush it and, ah, haul it to the service and further process it from there. Depending on what kind of salt you want in the end. Right? And there's this awesome mine called the wheel ish a salt mine in Krakow, Poland, and it has a full on cathedral made out of salt. What amazing there. Several like chapels, But then a full cathedral. Um, and it's all made assaults in this old salt mine. Wow, that's not a UNESCO site. Um, and they went to the trouble of boiling salt. It was a table salt mine. They would boil this raw salt and purify it, and then used that purified salt to make crystal chandeliers out. Assault, like the whole cathedral, is just solved. It's amazing looking, man. Yeah, check it out. No goats allowed so they would re cab Or know Chuck's allowed. I just walk around licking stuff, right? They would ask you not, uh, a deep shaft. Mining, by the way, I think is usually rock salt is what they're producing their right. And then there's solution. Mining. Yeah, That's, um basically, they take a well over a salt bed and then inject water in there and make a brine and then pump it up from the underground is a wet solution and into a vacuum pan, which is going to seal it up and they're gonna boil it and then evaporate it. Which is you know, how they made salt back in the old days to they would, you know, boil it, evaporate it and scraped the pan, right? So it's kind of a modern version of that right. Then they dry it out and refine it. And then from there, they're gonna either add anti clumping agents or iodine, depending on what you want. And then, um, with solution mining. You've got, like, a salt bed or a salt dome that's exposed because it's somehow through tectonic action. Ah, an ancient seabed or salt bed has been exposed to the above ground. Yeah, like the surface of the earth. Right Then what's the last one? Well, the old school solar method. Solar evaporation. This is when you have a salt lake or C water and wind and the sun cooperate with the shallow pools and they leave salt behind and you can only harvested about once a year once it reaches a certain level of ah, harvest ability of thickness. And ah, like we said, sometimes it's still done by hand, even although it is industrialized in other places, for sure. But you know, they wash it, they clean it, they drain it, but they leave the, um, a lot of impurities in there, and this stuff is almost 100% pure sodium chloride. It's good stuff. And like I said, I used the Mediterranean merchant generally. But Australia's big on it to come on this method. And, um, we should probably mention also that salt has a lot of, ah, religious significance. Oh, yeah, it's just a It's an ancient important thing to mankind. Yeah, they were, like, use it to seal important things. Yeah, in the Old Testament, which is pretty old. Sure, uh, slots wife, I believe her name is Sarah was the Sara Ruth who's married a lot turned into a pillar of salt when she looked behind her. Even though God said, Don't turn around, I'll turn you into a pillar of salt. Yeah, and she did. And apparently there's a There's a salt pillar, a mount, a rock. Um, that's called lots wife. People are like, That's her right there. And who, Ah, Is it Buddhists that ward off evil assault? Yes. Um, you me has a little shaker of salt that her mom put in the glove compartment of her car. Really? Yeah. Just shaking people with a flicker off, though. It's just a protector. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah. See, I would have eaten it. Okay, Let's I don't let you ride in your mom's car. That's right. One of several reasons. A out of the glove box. Uh, anything else I do? I have this good thing. And there is a Roman senator named Casio Doris and he said, Quote, mankind can live without gold, but not without salt. He was at Casio Keyboard Us yet. Well, you got Jerry again. Yeah, she's giggly today, and I have a plug because here in Atlanta, there's a ah, a lady who makes assaults. But if you go to Facebook and type and beautiful briny sea salt, go to her Facebook page and click on the about thing, you will see her lovely homemade handcrafted salts, and my favorite is the Magic unicorn. See if this sounds good. Sea salt isn't, of course, the main ingredient. Smoked paprika. Yeah, lemon, garlic, rosemary and celery seed. But it does some good. It's delicious. You get some broccoli in some cauliflower, some like beets and big chunks of garlic. Throw it out the window, then buy a steak and put this magical unicorn on some olive oil. Sprinkle it with this stuff. Bake in the oven. Delicious to go with that steak, You know, you know? Yeah, Magic unicorn is my favorite, and the black truffle salt is delicious. And then she has one called campfire, which is smoked salt with cumin and ancho chili powder. And, ah, if you email info at beautiful briny sea salt dot com, you can order some of this stuff is very nice of you. And I told Emily she's friend ours. I said, tell her I'm gonna plug her so she better get her little fingers working. You know, I start making some salt. Yeah. Good stuff you should. Arming is a salty crowd. So if you want to learn more about salt, I don't know how you possibly could, but if you want to look into it, you can type. The word s a l t into the search bar howstuffworks dot com. It will bring up this article how salt works. And since I said ah, search part. That means it's time for a listener mail. I'm gonna call this. We should apologize to cops. What do we do now? Well, this cop rode in and want to treat it. Is it the police chases one? Yeah. Yeah, they didn't like that one. Hey, guys. My name is Glen. I'm a police officer in Southern California. I've been enjoying the podcast for years. I suspect our political leanings made different times. But I always enjoy learning and listening to different points of view. Uh, listen to the December 17th manhunt. Podcast? That's not the police chase one. You're right. But I think it involves something like that. I felt it was very accurate, with the exception of some information you provided by the LAPD. Um, we bashed the LAPD before for their history of corruption. They have a pretty thick history of corruption. But they're not all bed ladies and men. Well, no, of course not. You mentioned that officers were super jumpy during the manhunt for Christopher Dorner, which was a fair assessment. But ah, here is where you got something kind of wrong. You stated that the LAPD fired on two uninvolved vehicles. It was the L A P. D. Who shot at one. And the Torrance Police Department shot it, the other. It could see how someone not from the area might think they're LAPD, so it's not that big of a deal. Okay. However, the bigger mistake is that you stated that these shootings killed two people. Nobody was killed, so I need to go back. I saw in several places that at least two people were killed. Yeah, accidentally, from those shootings. I'll go back and look again. Okay, But Glenn Josh takes issue. Well, he's not the only one who's written, and I just haven't gotten around going back in looking and double checking. But, I mean, while we were researching, I came across that and it wasn't like on a forum or message board or something like they were in articles. Okay, we'll get to the bottom of it. Uh, he was. Glenn says, I'm very surprised you would make such a statement without doing your homework. I did my homework. You typically appear to go to great lengths to fact check. Sometimes I get the feeling you guys, we're not the biggest fans of law enforcement. I'm not naive, unrecognized, my profession. Shortcomings for sure. Just like you, though, I want facts influencing the show, not personal opinions. Missing email was not intended to justify the actions of those two police departments just to set the record straight. Understood. And despite the goof in the cop bashing, huh? I still love the show. That's from Glenn. Um, and Glenn. I don't hate cops. I love cops. Um, we've done a lot of, like, super supportive shows on loan forces. Your checks like the law enforcement dude. But I don't like jerks. And I think a lot of times people's experience with cops or when they're pulled over and not being helped by a cop, which is unfortunate. Sure, because they do so much great work. But, you know, when you get pulled over and your hassle Bajor cup, you think, man, what a jerk got It's like eating at a bad restaurant. You know what I'm saying? Like you doesn't make already bad. You tell one or two people you have a bad experience at a restaurant, you tell like 20 people. Yeah, it's like 50 fold with cops. So we have a lot of respect for law enforcement for sure. For all they do s So I hope that doesn't across come across is any differently. Thanks, Glenn. Yeah. Thank you, Glen. I'll go back in double check if I'm wrong. I'll also admitted I just haven't had a chance to look again, we'll give him 20 licks. Oh, of a Bacchus ball from a goat and I might die of hyper Nutri Mia, a man that wrapped it all up right there.

There's guess Producer Andrew, this is stuff you should know. Let's get busy. I'm excited about this one. This was your, um, your pick. And I was like, What is Chuck talking about? Where you Really? Yes. And then Chuck, I happened to stumble upon. I don't know what I was looking for, but an email from somebody who sent like a Google doc or something. That's that was a list of episodes we said we should do, and people have set those in before. But this one was kind of condensed, and that was on there. So I've stumbled upon your dirty little secret. I don't think that's where I got it. Oh, really? I don't think so, but maybe. Okay, I just know that I am, um, always fascinated by not only New York City, but by the fact that New York City functions with that many people in all that everything. It's just all amazing to me that that city functions with that many people, that many buildings that, like, I want to do an episode on trash removal. Okay, I want to do one on birth. Male on wastewater treatment. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That is New York in general. That's been long brewing. Are you okay with that? Yeah, just just. Well, I mean, we can mention New York or whatever. Big thanks to Dave Rose, though. One of our great writers, they put this together, and it's really, really fascinating days, Justin. Amazing human. All of our writers are amazing. For sure. Dave is great as well. He's one of a few select amazing right. So, um, the reason why New York why anybody would ask about New York's water is because if you've ever interacted with the New Yorker, they talk about their water. Ah, lot. It's like kind of a thing in New York where they're like our tap water is the best water in the country. And they have, like, a lot of, um, stuff to back that up with and so much so that that that they say this this water is actually the reason why our bagels and our pizza are so good. Yeah, I was Ah, we were both just there for our final shows of the year. The Bell House. Thanks for people who came out. Yes, they were great, a lot of fun. And by the way, the guy that fell asleep on the front row on night number two, I think it's night number two. I was walking down the street and he randomly passed by driving in a car and rolled down his window and said, Hey, man, he's a great show. The other night, right? And I was waiting for him to say, Is that freedom Rock? And I said, Thanks, dude, I was like, front row, and he was so excited that I remembered that's any sit front row and he drove on before I had a chance to say you fell asleep. He's like I feel like I was there. Maybe I felt like a dream to I don't know, But, um, we were just there. And there are many, many restaurants in New York where there will be like a water cooler or a place where you can help yourself to your own cup of water, and it will have a big sign on it that says New York City Tap water and proud All caps underlined letters. Yeah, and and they mean like they're just getting water out of the tap or is in other cities. That's a dirty, shameful secret that people don't talk about that right in New York. They probably boast about it. And, um, the just the fact that New York or any New Yorker in the city gets water at all is pretty spectacular. It's like you said, there's a lot of people. There's a lot of buildings in something like more than a 1,000,000,000 gallons of water flow into New York through the taps every day. Yeah, I said day with the D. Yes, it is the largest water system in the United States. People from all over the world, uh, government officials fly in and taking meetings with the New York City water people just to see, like, How have you done it? They're just agog. How could we do better? So So that's impressive enough that a 1,000,000,000 more than a 1,000,000,000 gallons of water is delivered every day to New Yorkers. Pretty great. But the idea that you can just drink it straight from the tap and it is 90% unfiltered. Yeah, that is a truly impressive feat. Yeah, and by 90% unfiltered, We mean 90% of the water is unfiltered and 10% is filtered. Right? And you might say, How can you just filter 90% of the water? Well, it comes from different places. So 90% of the water comes from two places to watersheds that combined are called the Catskill Delaware watershed or water system. I think, um, and then the other one from the Crow Crow didn't always want to say crow tone, but from the Croton Reservoir, that 10% is actually filtered. We'll get into all of that. But 90% of New York's water is not. It doesn't go through a filtering process. And that makes New York one of only five major cities in the United States to get a waiver from the E p. A. That says Your water is so deliciously pure in delightful that you don't need to filter it. Um, almost every other city has to have a filtering process before it gets delivered. Two taps. That's right. And the other four? Naturally. Seattle. Portland, Oregon, San Francisco. The one that's a bit of a surprise is Boston, Massachusetts. What? That's that's That's how surprising it is, Chuck. Yeah, that's right. So let's talk a little bit about the history of New York in their water, because back in the day, we've always talked about how, what disgusting, disease ridden poop and horse urine ridden place New York City was? Yeah, like supposedly, there is a good 12 inches of horse manure on the street at all times before they, um before they really started cleaning the place up. It's pretty bad. I think that was in the win cries Typhoid Mary episode, which is a great one. Another great New York episode. So if we're talking New Amsterdam, pretty New York City, they got water where you would think from ponds and natural springs under water springs and they had a 48 acre pond. It's about 60 feet deep in Tribeca. What is now TriBeCa called the collect. And also the little collect that was just south of there on that name comes from the Dutch word call HQ, which means small body of water. And the collect was where they got the water for a long time until the city let Ah, Cem Tanner's built a tannery on the shores of the collect Not smart New York, which ruined everything. Yeah, because it started to get polluted. They also were able to drill wells and stuff around places where people pooped, impede and then dumped their poop and pee. Um, it was a dirty, dirty place because this is pre germ theory, or at least around the time that germ theory was being developed and people didn't understand it. Um, and I think it was our great stink episode where they traced a cholera epidemic to a public Well, um, a public water pump. Jon Snow, if I remember correctly, did that. And this would have been around the time that New Yorkers were suffering from cholera epidemics, one of which took place, and I think the 18 thirties 18 32 it killed 3500 New Yorkers, and that was a substantial amount of of the population at the time. And another 100,000 New Yorkers had to flee just to get away from this caller epidemic. And it was because their sewage and their water was co existing in very unhealthy way. So New York said it. Maybe we should try something else. Let's look a little further outside the city where we're dumping are wasted everything. See if we can get our order from there. And they did. They built the Croton Reservoir. They dam the river in reservoir collected, they said. Now we have some beautiful pure water. We will never need to do anything again to get our water. That's right. Previous to that, though, in the 18th century they had these public pumps like you were talking about on street corners about every four blocks or so, a big wooden pump where you would get your water from underground underground streams and springs and stuff. But there are only a few of these that actually delivered good water. A lot of it was really brackish and gross tasting and Americans in early European settlers obviously love their tea and said they've marked This is almost like an early yelp or whatever. They had these pumps that actually delivered, like the two or three good pumps in the city that delivered good water labeled tea, water pumps like it was good enough to use for t Good enough to use for making good tea. Okay. And so they would go to these tea water pumps. He would have to buy the water. Um, the best one was apparently at Chatham in Roosevelt. Ah, there was another and sort of what the lower east side is today. That was a good tea water pump. And this worked out for a long time until ah, the, uh the collected, all this stuff. It started to sort of get nasty and stinky. And so they built a canal to channel that water into the river like that. We gotta get rid of it and drain this thing. Right? So they build this canal 40 feet wide, they channel it right after they finish it, this canal begins to sink. And in 18 21 it got so bad, the smell was so bad that they eventually just covered up the canal. And guess what that became? I don't know. Central Park, Canal Street. Oh, come on. That's stupid. I wasn't even there in the right part of the city. That's all right. We've even done an episode on Central Park and that wouldn't forget it. Yes, Canal Street obvious. That's where Canal Street came from. That was literally a canal. And then, eventually an underground sewage system under running under Canal Street Right on. And there's another cool little tidbit if you want. Like your little New York history. If you like to walk around on subways and tell people about cool things. Yeah, um, one of the first public reservoirs in the city was dug by Aaron Burr and his Manhattan company, and that didn't work out. They transported it through wooden logs as pipes buried beneath the city. Somebody found a piece of that wooden log it in, and one of the museum's up there now. No, no way. Yeah, that is very cool. But the water didn't taste great, and it didn't work out for Aaron Burr. So he ah, chain. He still kept the Manhattan company, but he got into banking and the Manhattan company became Chase Manhattan Bank. I saw somewhere that that was his aim all along. That the water thing was just basically a fleece to raise money, to found a relic and that that's why the water was so shoddy and the delivery was so shoddy. But what they were selling was so bad, supposedly the horses wouldn't even drink it. So it's a scam. It was basically a scam. Aaron Burr was not the greatest historical American shot. Alexander Hamilton. I know that that's enough right there, right? And then also scammed a bunch of people out of there. There, Um, water investment. That's right, because I mean, if you want to invest in a bank, you want to invest in a bank. If you want to invest in a water outfit, you want to invest in a water off. You want people to be above the boards with stuff like that. That's right above the hall. That's my tirade. So you mentioned the Croton Dam and the curtain reds of war. I want to say crotona as well. Yeah, uh, that became and that Aqueduct became operational and things were okay, but then tragedy struck with the great fire of 18. 35. Yes, which actually, I guess that the great fire took place right before the reservoir was open. Which is why the great pianists or bad. Yeah. So in 18. 35! On a night in December, a warehouse caught fire and it just leveled lower Manhattan, like, just destroyed something like, um, 17 city blocks 50 acres of the most densely populated part of New York at the time. And, um, luckily, only two people died. Two is two too many, but considering that it was 17 city blocks that got reduced to ash, that's not bad, actually, especially considering that the way that they ended up fighting this fire was by setting buildings on the perimeter on fire because they didn't have the amount of water that they needed. Yeah, that the reason for that I was just sort of really bad luck. There were two smaller fires that drained our our like I'm a New Yorker. Listen to me. You're an honorary New York. Over guess. It drained the cisterns, the reserve cisterns that they had, and because of those two smaller fires, they didn't have enough to fight the Great Fire. And the long and short of all of this is New York said we gotta really speed up this Croton reservoir work. Yep. And they did. And so the Crimson Reservoir was brought online in the middle of the 19th century, and they had a big old parade and everything, Um, and it delivered something like 90 million gallons of delicious pure water to New York. Um, in the in the middle of the 19th century is a really big deal, and it worked really well for a very long time. But, um, there was also they built the Murray Hill Reservoir. So the the Croton Reservoir would be where the water collected upstate. And then they build an aqueduct system, which is still around in parts today. An elevated aqueduct to what's called the Murray Hill Reservoir, which is a four acre above ground swimming pool. Medically, it's pretty cool if you look at pictures. Yeah, yeah. It was like a really spot in the city. While it was around. I think something till went 18 42 to 1900. It was around. People used to take strolls around it and make paintings of it and that kind of thing. And it is where the New York Public Library is now. Today, where the Ghostbusters did some of the early work. All right, all right. But the it worked really well for, you know, the time. But then, as New York grew and grew and grew, it became very painfully obvious yet again that New York had outgrown its water supply. Yeah, they needed more water. 90 million gallons a day wasn't enough. Ah, And then what made matters worse was in 18 98 New York City officially made it a declaration that we're now not just lower Manhattan, Of course, didn't call lower Manhattan at the time. That was just sort of where the city ended. They called a manna Hata a Mana hatta. I saw that episode, by the way. It was one of the better ones ever. Which one of, ah, think of what we do in the dark? That's right where they go to party in Manhattan. Man, I had a, um what we do in the shadows? Yeah. Yeah. Um, that's all right. The five boroughs were included in 89 8 officially, so New York. Um, and the water needed to get to the people was officially grown to more than three million people by the time the 40th century turned right, which is just precious today. Three million New Yorkers. Oh, my gosh. Really? D'oh! So they started Look upstate again because they had hit upon, like a pretty good idea. The city is is a cess pool. Um, we need our water from outside of the cess pool, and they started looking upstate. So this time they looked up to the Catskills and they found two watersheds which we did an episode on watersheds that I would love to forget. But it came up just now. Oh, I thought it was good. Now Oh, man, it was horrendous. Was it? Yes. I thought was terrible and boring. January 2017. I don't remember when it came out. Like I said, I tried to forget that it ever happened. I thought it was pretty good. But anyway, so watershed is basically a specific topographical area where rain, snow, whatever precipitation falls down into this area and is delivered to a specific Creek River stream, something like that that eventually and empties into, like, a real acre reservoir, something like that. So there's two watersheds. The Delaware in the Catskill Water said that put together create something like, um, 2000 square miles of water catching goodness and it delivers it to, ah, number of different reservoirs. And that is now today. Where? New York. It's like 90% of its water. Yeah, so, you know, obviously they had to dam up rivers. You create these reservoirs. And this all happened in Reno in the early 19 hundreds. And then finally, they were like, Great, We've got all these reservoirs in the Catskills. But let me remind you, we're on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, surrounded by horse urine and a lot of it and poop. We need our fresh water. How do we get it here? So in 1917 the engineers of New York City completed the 92 mile Catskill Aqueduct. Yep, which is amazing. It's basically a big concrete tunnel that sends water, uh, 92 miles from the Catskills down to New York. It's his wife is 30 feet in some places. It is not a tunnel the entire length, as we will see here in a minute. Not a continuous tunnel, Right? I'm not sure what that means. What is it? Just like open? There's parts of it that aren't technically a tunnel in that it's a covered trench. Okay, cut a trench, and then they covered it back up. Which I don't know how you do that, but it's not technically a tunnel, like a circle or tube. Interesting. And here is to me one of the facts of the show. You get this water down there in the aqueduct and you get to the Hudson River on what you gonna d'oh. You've got to go under it right to me and just be like, just pump it in the Hudson and hope it comes out the other side. But then I would have gotten fired immediately when I tried that ideas. No. Engineer? No, He's a sham. He's a rapscallion. So it gets to the Hudson River, and then it goes way down into the ground about 1100 feet below sea level and then climbs back up the other side. And it does all this via gravity. Yes. And they did that not just to show off, but because they decided I read this Awesome. Are you know, I'm always, like read the contemporary articles I read one from 1907 where they were talking about the construction of the aqueduct. And they said that the reason why they were going down that far is because they wanted to hit bedrock because it would be Fisher free, meaning there would be no leakage. And they could just pump the water through the hole that they board in the bedrock. Well, they thought the bedrock was gonna be about 500 feet down. And by 1907 when they rode the Scientific American article, they'd reached, like 700 feet, still hadn't hit it. It ended up being like 1100 feet below sea level, where they finally hit bedrock. And that's why they had to drill so far down. And they drilled a tunnel, a vertical shaft from the ah, from the Hudson down to that tunnel, and they built like a tube to pressurize it. So the water 1100 feet under the Hudson is that, like 15 tons per square foot of pressure, which also helps. But the fact that there's no pumps or anything, it's all gravity and pressure driven. Yes. And sadly, though, that story has a sad ending because it took so long that they're Fisher free, and, 03 t shirts were all rendered useless. What? No, I don't know. It's a great joke. I'm gonna go back and listen to it, and I'll probably think it's hilarious. So many compliments on it in advance. Oh, man, That was a quality joke. Three. Oh, God. Okay, sure. Sure. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I got you. All right. And we're all together now. Okay, That is a pretty good joke. Uh, cheese. Should we take a break after that? Yeah. All right, let's take a break. We'll talk a little bit more about this. So called Aqueduct right after this Problems. It's human nature to hate problems. But why is that? After all, problems inspire us to mend things, Ben. Things make things better. That's why so many people work with IBM on everything from city traffic, toe, ocean, plastic, new schools to new energy flight delays to food safety. Smart loves problems. IBM. Let's put smart toe work. Visit IBM dot com slash smart toe learn more. Okay, Chuck. So we've got the Catskill Aqueduct delivering water. Um, there's another one to called the, um, the Delaware Aqueduct. And this one actually is like a genuine tunnel. Yes, it's 85 miles completed and 44. Not gonna make a t shirt joke about that. And it is still the longest continuous tunnel in the world at 85 miles. And they did this all you know, just this digging process is amazing in and of itself. Digging these tunnels and these trenches with steam shovels and pouring the concrete tunnel, which I was like, How do you do that? Even? Yeah, you do the bottom half let it set, and then you do the top half and let that set. So they were like Charles Bronson in the Great Escape. They were digging tunnels. Yeah. I mean, we're talking like dynamite and stuff like that. Like they really did it. The old school way to build these aqueducts and they're still in use today. So much so that there's there's three tunnels. Tunnel number one in tunnel number two have been in operation since 1917 and 1936. They've never stopped operating. They've never been stopped up and drained and inspected in over 100 years for tunnel number one. Yeah, I think the current memo going around is, I'm sure it's fine. Well, so they're building tunnel number three and they decided to start building tunnel number three in 1954. They actually started in 1970. They're still not done with tunnel number three. It sizing parts of it are online. And when it does fully come online tunnel number three will have a capacity enough so that they can individually stop and drain and inspect and repair tunnel number one and then eventually tunnel number two. So that's number three. Yeah, totally. Tunnel number three will save the other two, and it's good that they're doing it now. But I saw that it's going to be fully operational in 2021. They think, Wow, so we're almost there. The almost man. Yeah, it's the New York longest running municipal project. Ah, $5 billion price tag so far and counting, I guess. And then those three tunnels are to and however many parts of three year working deliver 1.3 gallons of water a day through a network of Mainz and then individual pipes leading to apartments and homes and businesses and skyscrapers and all of those pipes, if he total them up, would lay out about 7000 miles. That's pretty impressive. I would also like to point out that I think you meant 1.3 billion gallons. Would I say 1.3 gallons? Didn't really, which would be hilarious, that they went to all this trouble, spent all this money, and they're like We can crank out 1,000,003 gallons of a New York, gather around and get your water. I was still thinking about my T shirt joke joke. And here's the kicker to another great fact of the show. Only 5% of all of the city's water relies on pumps to get to its final destination, which means your tap. It's pretty awesome. Yeah, so that means that it can't break down. Or if something does happen, they still have things like gravity to help things along. It's great. So the reason why the e. P. A. Gave New York a, um, a waiver and said you don't have to filter the water coming from the Catskill in the Delaware watersheds is because his Giuliani grease the poems of the E p a. Exactly it start. Well, it started out is so pure and pristine and just great, um, water to begin with. But they have taken steps along the way to ensure that it stayed that way because one of the things that happened with the Croat in reservoir is development was allowed to grow up around it. Um, agriculture was allowed to pollute it. Um, it just got it turned. And after that the e p A. I think in the nineties, the late 90 said, You guys have to start filtering that water. It's no longer unfiltered. Herbal. Um, it's it's not drinkable as is. So they had to start filtering. It used to be 100% of of New York's water was unfiltered. That Croton Reservoir now is 10%. That is filtered. But so they learned a valuable lesson from that. And now they're very proactive in keeping the Delaware and Catskill Reservoir water shed water from becoming corrupted by things like development in agriculture. Yeah, and but, you know, the lesson they learned is money because you might be thinking like, What's the big deal? Why don't they just filter all of it. It's a lot cheaper to take care of the land and make sure you never have to filter it than to install a filtering plant. Yeah, because they estimate that a filtering plant would cost something like $10 billion up front and then $100 million a year to operate. New York is spending something like $1 billion every several years to protect the the Delaware in the Catskill watersheds. So it is an enormous investment. But also it's great because it's natural water that's unfiltered. Yeah, and you know, they do this in a number of ways. Aside from buying up 40% of the land, which was a good move and making sure nothing happens to it. Yep. So? So New York City owns a lot of land upstate. Oh, yeah, to Steph. I have 40%. Yeah, it's a lot of land, um, not 40% of New York State, but 40% of the property around the Catskill in Delaware watersheds. They also did things like, Hey, let's look at all the waste water treatment facilities upstream on. Let's invest a lot of money and upgrading those Hey, all you people that have septic tanks that are falling apart that matter. So we're gonna reimburse you 5200 homeowners. Yeah, that's impressive. Yeah, installing the septic tank and we're gonna pay for it. Um, they remove dead trees. They replace those with little sapling trees who apparently have roots that are young and can absorb a lot of harmful nutrients from that rainwater. And here's another good fact of the show. Some of the water from those reservoirs are from that that watershed can take up to a full year to make its way down to the tap that you're drinking out of. That's a good one. I like that one. It's almost like the how long you take sunlight to reach us. And you were gonna say that it's the same thing. It's the same thing. They also did you talk about farmers. The only difference being the stats is you don't have to explain what a photon is. You can just say water. It's a tiny packet of light. It's Thea give a carrier of electromagnetic endings, right? What did you ask right before that? Did you talk about the farmers? How they trained farmers up upstate to I did not. So they say, Hey, you Hicks. You're gonna learn these techniques, man, too. I'm just kidding. I love farmers. I would actually, as a matter of fact, Chuck, when I, um when I retire, I really, really want, like, a small working farm. Oh, yeah, Very small. Like what do you want? Like 1/10 of an acre small. Know what kind of stuff do you want? A farm? What do you want? Oh, I don't care. I Yeah, Yeah, some animals, but just, you know, having pigs around, not to eat or milk, but Thio Picture like basically, but to like, um, churn up like a field. Okay. So that I can plan it the next year and move the pigs to the next part of the the land. That kind of stuff for chickens to just walk around and eat their eggs and things like that. Chickens, Some pigs. You want some? Probably a couple of goats, a couple of goats. You want some planting? You want to farm some plants and vegetables? Sure. Yeah, but mainly just tow. Have something to do, like with the earth. So I was 100 1,000,000% teasing when when I said that New York was calling the Farmer Sex New York Probably dig. Call the farmers Hicks. But I wasn't condoning that. I was just making a joke, right? You're the guy who wants 1/10 of an acre one day to do something on the notion that the pigs are gonna be like There's some pretty tight quarters around here. Oh, you know what else I would do? What? And I would need more of 1/10 more than 1/10 of an anchor for this. Raise bees. That is where I will actually raise bees. It's on Josh's farm. Well, brother, you better get some land soon because it's it's leaving that around face. Land is leaving. Yeah, I mean, it's people are buying land. It's theirs. I remember my parents looking at land when I was like, 10 years old and they didn't buy it, says leaving. And it's a different deal now. It's a lot harder to find the land that you want. You know, people bought it all up. I know you can still get it, but you gotta pay through the nose for it. Yeah, or it's up to them. If they want to sell it or not, you know? Sure. We're getting second rate. We're getting sloppy seconds. Okay. Oh, man. That's gonna be one of those things that, like our younger listeners, is going to be in college smoking pot in a dorm room and it'll just hit him. What? You just said 15 years on. Oh, goodness. So you mentioned the curtain. Watershed needs the filtering. Um, and they're trying to avoid that at all costs with the other watersheds. But, ah, the Croton water supply. When they built this filtering system, it costs $3.2 billion it's under a golf course in New Jersey. It's is so appropriate. That's where the tainted water is under a golf course in Jersey, In Bedminster, perhaps. Sure, I don't know what that is, but it sounds right now. Some people will get that one. New York's like, Hey, you Hicks, build a golf course over this. New York just calls everybody else hicks. And that's right. They dio when we could fly in a welcome hicks. Okay, so, um, but it will be taking our second break it now we probably should, though there's a good time Okay, We're going to take another break, and we're gonna come back and explain what New York does due to its water and whether or not it is a secret ingredient in bagels and pizza, you know, check out. Some people are like, Oh, the holidays come earlier and earlier every year, like it's some sort of problem. Yeah, well, I would tell those people, chuck, that they need to try Make Cafe's new seasonal treats because they're going to get them in the holiday spirit. Right quick. That's right, man. We're talking warm, flaky donut sticks made fresh every morning sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. They are back, everybody, and now a new chocolate dipping sauce comes along with it. Delicious. Yeah, plus, let's just talk about the new cinnamon cookie lot. That's right. It's made with cinnamon sugar syrup, hand stirred with milk and rich, freshly brewed espresso man. And then it's topped off with a Sprinkle of cinnamon. Yeah, it tastes like the holidays, and it's gonna put you in the holiday spirit. Warm up to the holidays with donuts sticks, now a chocolate sauce, and the new cinnamon cookie lot on Lee from McCafe Good is brewing for a limited time only at participating McDonald's. All right, Chuck. So one thing that you're gonna want to say If you're a New Yorker and your boasting about your tap water, there are some things you should know. Number one. It's chlorinated number two. It's been run through a UV filter. Even if it hasn't been filtered. Filtered. There's still things that are done to it. It's not like it's coming straight out of the Catskills into your tap. Yeah, they take it very seriously, obviously. Ah, here's a good stat. In one year, there are more than 15,000 water samples taken and analyze at the source. So this is upstream? Um, they have Ah a I will not a I or is it a I? There's a I involved. Somehow there always is. I always ask if it's a I want I always ask you because you know, sure, no. Thanks to the end of the world with Josh Clark. Thanks for the plug. Still available on iTunes, the I heart podcast app or wherever you find your podcasts. Wow, That wasn't just a plug. That was an ad. So they have these robotic buoys that monitor the Kensico Reservoir, one of the reservoirs that feeds down into New York. And these things take 1.9 million measurements a year and wirelessly transmit that back to the Department of Environmental Protection in New York. Yeah, which is pretty awesome. And they had a buoy before, but they had to remove it in winter because ice would mess with it in this new one. Um, apparently is ice loving. Oh, yeah. Yep. They also if you walk down the street, um, there's something like 1300 no. 965 965 little gray boxes that if you could open up, you would find a little sink in a faucet. It's adorable. Maybe a ah little sample size of locks attain soap. And that's a water sampling station. It says. N Y d P. Department of Environmental Protection and scientists walk up to these things, unlock him and take samples and test for all sorts of different things to make sure that Thea the water getting to New York is good. Yeah, it's just more than that. It says New York City drinking water sampling station on the front of it. Oh, wow. they really? They really spell it out. You haven't said Fisher free, you know, three him down. There s so that you know, they're testing. They take 1300 water samples a month. Musharraf. He said that? But they were from these particular stations on they do. All kinds of tests are testing, obviously for ah, turbidity, which is cloudiness ph chlorine bacteria. Does it stink? Like all kinds of tests that they're doing right? Um and usually the New York City water is going to pass all these tests like it's there's not gonna be a problem. This is just a extra little quality assurance that they're doing, because by the time it reaches these testing stations, that's where it's going to the taps. Anyway, it's tapping into the tap water. But that's right. So, um, that 10% of water goes through a couple extra steps. That is, um, that that the other 90% doesn't go through. One of the first things that doesn't a treatment plan is it's mixed with alum, which is a component of aluminum, right. An alum attracts organic compounds and basically says rise to the surface with me and creates flock, which is a white, frothy sludge and all that is just skimmed off the top. That's step one. Yeah, this sounds so gross. And it is Yeah, but like in the end, you get your good water. The next thing that happens is it flows through these giant water filters. Um, they've put it is like these giant Britta filters, it's essentially sort of the same thing. And this is just gonna further purify the water, passing through the layers and layers of stuff like sand on anthro site. And then comes the ultraviolet light that you referenced earlier, right? Yes. In 100% of New York's water is sent through a UV filter because UV filters air really good at disrupting reproduction of bacteria. Um, and so all water is apt, but that 90% of water that's not filtered that goes through a separate UV filtering plant that's built just for those. That's right, that that's where, like a 1,000,000,000 gallons of water a day or zapped with UV lights. But, um, so all of that gets combined together eventually and comes out your tap, and New Yorkers drink it straight from the tap literally. It is very bizarre because I don't know if it's a placebo effect or what, but I feel like it does taste pretty good for tap water. It does. But at the same time, I typically don't drink just straight tap water, so my frame of reference isn't necessarily right there. You wanna hear something funny? Yeah. You know what my brother's favorite water is and what? It's probably just a bit, but he claims it's true. What? Hose water. Oh, I know what he's talking about. Yeah, like when your water in the car or watering the car when you're washing the car here. All right, grow car when you're watering your mini so it grows into an SUV, right? So, um, I think the reason why Scott is onto something is because when you're drinking from a hose, it's summertime and it's hot out. Yeah, and you're probably working hard. Maybe definitely. It definitely does taste different, for sure. So when it comes to New York water, everyone says it's the best in the country. There are rankings, actually, and it is 13 out of 100 metro areas in the U. S. So it's not the best, literally, by definition, not in the best water. And then you gotta move to Arlington, Texas, if you want. Uh, and this was this was from 10 years ago, but I'm not sure the current status is Imagine Arlington still up there, though? Sure, but you're gonna have to have a lot more reasons than that to move to Arlington, Texas. Ouch. That when I'm not taking what are some of the problems that with New York water? Well, there's two big problems. Turbidity, which you mentioned earlier, which is, um ah, sediment suspension in the water, which gives it kind of a cloudy or darker, gritty kind of look, which is It's not just that it looks bad. It's pathogens can cling to that sentiment, so it's not something you want suspended. Plus, it also makes it much more difficult to filter that stuff out. It's like extra work that has to be done to try to get rid of that settlement. And if you're not filtering your water to begin with, that's kind of a problem. Um, and then secondly, the other one is nutrients over. It's over nutrient, meaning it's just packed with bribe. Oh, Flavin. Well, what? It actually is his fertilizer runoff. You know those farmers, they're doing their best. But there is fertilizer that goes downstream and runs into the watersheds. And phosphorus is one of the biggest problems because farmers do fertilize with phosphorus and if it runs off, the phosphorus alone is not great, cause it can cause algae blooms and stuff like that. And it can taste bad and stink because when the algae dies, it decays, and it does not smell good. Now it does not smell good, but, um ah, bigger problem, though, is when you combine that with the chlorine because, like we said, New York water is chlorinated in florid ated. We had the T shirts to prove it, all right. I don't think we said it was floored dated, but yeah, everybody knows yes for dated. And when you combine that chlorine with the phosphorus, it can create byproducts called disinfection byproducts on that is no good at all. No, those air nasty. They're called D B P's, and they are basically like chemicals that are accidentally made from from sanitizing water and not just with chlorine but chlorine chloramine. There's a bunch of different stuff that they used to disinfect water, and all of them can can combine with organic called compounds to create really just nasty stuff like, um, Carson edges. Carcinogens. Um, some can produce miscarriages that just really, really bad stuff that can be produced in the drinking water. Chloroform is one of those byproducts. Yeah, which is why New Yorkers frequently faint when they're drinking tampon. But this all sounds super scary. New York City they are, They think there are eight known contaminants, but they're still apparently well under the legal limit, depending on what you think about how the legal limits are set up for right. Exactly. It's a good caviar, but New York City drinking water is 30.9 parts per 1,000,000,000. Chloroform on the national averages 11 so their way higher on chloroform. But as far as all of those d B P's total there far below the legal limit and just a little bit above average nationally, right, and then the total number of D B. P's that they have is actually less than those in Arlington. So interesting chew on that. Arlington. That's right. You on that bad pizza. Speaking of chewing chuck and pizza, let's just answer this question. Is New York City's water the key ingredient to New York City bagels and pizza? Uh, I think I mean, you can't definitively say, but I think it does have something to do with it, for sure. It's got to because science is involved. So here's the thing. The water from the Catskills and from the Delaware is naturally soft, meaning that it's low in calcium and magnesium. Where do you fall on loving, softer hard water? I'm a hard water guy. Same here, man. When I lived in Arizona, they had soft water where I lived in, uh, my sister's house that I lived in. And most of the house has had water softened error, I guess hardening units or whatever in the house. Yeah, because you can't feel clean like you never feel like you got the shampoo or the so half its own awful. It's just awful. Does anyone like soft water? I don't know. Weirdos. Probably. I mean, hard water. Sorry. No, I had it all backwards. Okay, so So you like soft water? Yeah, that's why that's why I Actually that's why I misspoke. They had water softeners right in Arizona because the water was hard. New York water is soft. I like soft. Okay, I like hard water typically cause I feel like I'm clean afterward. But soft water, like just the New York water is fine with me, but a softened like a chemically softened water I can't stand. Really? Yes, Interesting. But New York's is naturally soft, so it doesn't have calcium. Magnesium words very low in those things, comparatively. And that actually has an effect on taste, like calcium and magnesium can provide, like a bitter taste toe water. So there's one thing that they're saying like, Okay, the dough isn't going to taste naturally bitter because of the calcium. Magnesium. That's something that is something. And it also interacts with the flower if you're gonna make a bagel or a bialy or pizza crust, baby, or, you know a lot of things when you're baking. But those of the big three in New York Yeah, you're gonna be using flour and water as your base for your dough and hard water. The minerals in those tap water gonna fortify the gluten, and they're gonna make it tough and less flexible. You don't want to soft, though, because it'll have the opposite effect. It'll be gooey, and you won't be able to work it as well. And apparently, the American Chemical Society says New York City tap water is the Goldilocks of bagel water. It is just right. Yep, not too hard, not too soft, just perfect for a bagel and for a pizza. And that the American Chemical Society quote came from a Smithsonian article, and they went on to say, Probably, though it's actually the techniques that New Yorkers used to make bagels like. They poach the bagel, though first like they boil it. That's the only way to do a bagel. Sure does not boil on a bagel. No, it's not. It's like a big doughnut. It's not a doughnut, basically, and then they also, um, will, ah, they'll let the yeast sit for a little while that make it ferment, which creates volatile flavor compounds. So, um, it just tastes better, they're saying, probably those are the reasons why New Yorkers make better bagels or pizza, and it's not really the water. The water's just contributes a very small amount. I think it's all those things. Why not? No one can say for certain So let's just say yes, it is things. Well, if you want to know more about New York City's tap water, go on a New York City and try their tap water. And since I said that it's time for listener mail, everybody, I'm gonna call this, uh, house rolling. And we talked about TP ing houses. Yes. Let the podcast guys just finish up trick or treating and you're talking about rolling houses. I grew up in Franklin, Tennessee, where we used to roll houses all the time in Franklin, Tennessee. For people don't know is where a lot of big shot Nashville bigwigs live because you can buy a huge house with lots of land. That was Chuck speaking, right? Funny thing, though, guys, I'm back to being Brandon. Okay? Anything that guy's My neighbor was Brad Paisley. There's a couple of years before his first Grammy Award. Once we found this out, we knew would that we had to get him. So my sister and I gathered all of our friends dressed in black and snuck out to roll this country Music stars house. We were halfway through the job when his freaking tour bus rolled up on us. At first we all ran away. Frightened, but we were pretty much caught in the act. No, where to go? He got off the bus and was super nice about the whole thing. Actually, he gave us a quick tour of the tour bus, chatted us up for a little while. We even cleaned up the little bit of mess we had made and left starstruck. Highly doubt. He remembers that night at all. But my friends and I will certainly never forget. Anyway. That's all I got. Guys have a spooky Halloween. That is from Brandon Saunders. That is very nice, brain. And thanks a lot for that e mailing hats off to Brad Paisley for being so cool. He doesn't take his head off, but all right, exactly. But also, how about just a hat tip in? Are actually I was thinking Kenny Chesney because he's bald. No, none of those guys take their hats off dude s o. But also, he hangs out with Peyton Manning, which means that he must be a good guy, right? Oh, yeah. Didn't paint a good dude. Sure. I'm just started seeing him on my TV. Oh, that's not gonna happen any time soon. Pretty soon you'll see him in augmented reality. You're going to say that where you go like it or not.

I'm Josh. There's Chuck. There's Josh. Let's go! Key West Florida Dateline. Southernmost point of the United States Smugglers Island That's what it's called sometimes, yeah, because Key West, obviously just the location itself is gonna lend itself to smuggling, smuggling stuff in from other places by boat. And I mean, it has like, it was a pirate haven for a very long time, but apparently that the local population really took to that and just kept it up. But like over time, what they were smuggling just kind of changed. And at this point in question, this point in history that we're going to kind of dive into right now it had become marijuana and cocaine. Those were what was being smuggled through Key West, the glorious eighties keys of cocaine in Key West, shortest shorts you've ever seen. Oh, imagine eso these drugs were coming into South America through Cuba. And then, obviously from there, it's a It's a quick 90 miles to get to Key West. There's a report from the U P I. In 1983 the quote cruise on fishing boats brazenly unloaded bales of marijuana high school Utes made big money driving the contraband 100 and 50 in mine miles northward to Miami. Drug dealers have live a champagne parties at Pier House, the posh waterfront hotel. So these kids were driving this stuff up in Just sit in the back of the pickup trucks? Well, yeah. Around the island in particular, I think when they left the driver to Miami, they're a little cooler, but it was a tarp over it, please. Why? It opened in key west of the time. Like the local law enforcement, the local, Um Ah, like city government. Yeah. Everybody seemed to either be directly involved in smuggling or turning a blind eye to it, probably because they're getting kickbacks or whatever. Was there a fire station that was shut down? Yeah, because so many firefighters were busted for marijuana smuggling that they had to shut the thing down and one of the Fire chief's was actually put in prison for it. Amazing. So by the bite, 1982 with the latest, if not earlier, the Reagan administration said This totally contradicts what Nancy's saying. We're going to do something about this, and they set up the South Florida task force against Crime, which doesn't really create any kind of good acronyms. And I found a little death. F ing t f. You gotta have some See vowels in there. Yeah. Come on, Ronnie. Right. So by 1982 he Ah, well, not he. Yeah. Ronnie alone. Sure. He named the organization to Hey, they intercepted $2 billion in drugs coming through South Florida in just 1982 alone. Imagine how much they missed. Oh, sure, you know. Yeah. So they were really cracking out. They also, like, basically took over the city government. Um, investigated the police like they really went into Key West and the keys in general and said we were cleaning this place up, and that was two billion in street value, right? But that always cracked me up that they used to always say that, Yeah, I think they kind of inflate that to make a little street like the manufacturer's suggested retail price. And that's our P. So one of the things they did on this tax task force was set up A border patrol checkpoint and between the again in the Florida Keys are off the mainland of Florida so they would set it up between the keys in the mainland. Florida City? Yeah, just right there at Florida City on Highway one, just south of that. And basically effectively, what they did was shut off Key West's from the rest of the United States. Yeah, they say the only way in and out. They raised the border up above the keys and basically made the keys like another country. Ostensibly, that's exactly what happened. And the keys did not like this very much. Shall we take a break? Okay, Sure. Problems. It's human nature to hate problems. But why is that? After all, problems inspire us to mend things bend things make things better. That's why so many people work with IBM on everything from city traffic toe, ocean, plastic, new schools to new energy flight delays to food safety. Smart loves problems. IBM. Let's put smart toe work. Visit IBM dot com slash smart toe learn more. OK. Chucks of the Border Patrol is now basically doing drug searches because they were saying ostensibly we have this roadblock to keep migrants from coming through illegally. Yeah, that was sort of how they dressed it up right right, but legal aliens. But they were looking for migrants. According to Ah, I think Florida history dot or ge They were looking for migrants in the glove compartment under the seat of the car. Something like that. So really, that was part of this drug crackdown. And I mean, that was bad enough that they were masquerading. You know, one thing for another, but the effect that it was having was really negative on the keys in general. And Key West in particular. Yeah. I mean, they rely a lot on tourism. You couldn't get enter out. There was a 17 mile traffic jam. Imagine what it said. 17 minutes it for ourselves like that. I just feel like I just drive right into the ocean. Yeah, 17 miles. Are you kidding me? So, you know, hotels are empty restaurants or not doing any business bars or not doing any business, which was a big deal there. It's You know, it sounds silly to talk about restaurants and bars not operating, but when that's a big part of your income, sure, it's a big deal. So they said we've had enough. They got together and they filed an injunction against the U. S. Border Patrol. This is the people of the keys. The government's Yes, Yeah, the community. The people at large said, We're doing this. They took him to federal court in Miami. The court said, No, you can. You can keep that roadblock. So the mayor of Key West, Dennis Wardlow, which I looked him up, and I fully expected him to look different than he looked. Oh, really? Yeah. I expected him to look kind of like a Jimmy Buffett type. I did, too, and he didn't. What does he look like? He looked sort of square. Did he look like the evil banker from It's a Wonderful Life because that's kind of the opposite of Jimmy Buffet. No, but I fully pictured like a guy in like a Hawaiian shirt and no shoes and long hair. But he looked square. He looked a little square. That's fine, but it was 1982. He did on short shorts suit, So the press is there. He leaves the courthouse after the defeat. They said, you know what's going on? What you gonna d'oh? And he says, a very I attention grabbing, ear grabbing thing tomorrow at noon, The Florida Keys will secede from the union. So you had a sense of humor. He did, But he also had a lot of follow through on a sense of humor. So yeah, it wasn't just a joke. No, because the next day people showed up to see what would happen. And at noon he came out and he said, Okay, first things first. The Key West is no longer a part of the United States. It's its own independent nation called the Conch Republic. Yes, a sovereign nation of the Fifth World. Yeah, And there's this really great Atlas Obscura article about the Conch Republic. And they described the Fifth World as, um So you know, of the first world. Second World. Third World is Yeah, everybody. We should say this is an outdated Cold War thing. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So the United States and its allies were first world. The Soviet Union and its allies were second World on Aligned countries or developing countries. Third World, Fourth World, where people who were stateless I'd never heard that before. I had neither. Apparently Dennis Wardlow had because he said that the Conch republic was the first Fifth World Nash in pretty free smart, which existed as a state of mind. He said we exist is a state of mind in aspire, only to bring more warmth, humor and respect to a planet we find in sore need of all three. That, by the way, you guys don't know this was in the exceptional Dennis Wardlow. Impressive. He sounds exactly like me. Flowers. That's crazy. So he officially changes his position from his title from mayor of Key West to Prime Minister of the Conch Republic. And I felt like I had heard this somewhere before, but I might just be thinking of other crackpot weirdos like sea land and the pineapple called that There's a history of people that do things like this. Really? Yeah. When we've talked about a lot of them. Okay. Number See? Land? Yeah. Not impressed. No, I I had forgotten about them. Did they declare themselves sovereign? Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. In the ocean. It was like a floating apart or something. Can you start your own country? I think was the episode. Yeah, that was it. That was a good so, uh, prime Minister of the Conch Republic. And he had a mock secession. A declaration of war on the United States Right off the bat. That's a big one. He declared war and, uh, ended with loaves of Cuban bread being broken over the head of a man dressed as a U S naval. Sir, that was the war of aggression that conch republic inflicted on the United States. Yes. So they're having fun at this point because the press is there, and this is the whole point is they're trying to get press. They are. They're trying to draw attention to the road block. They're also trying to draw attention to their tourism. Um, And then after after a minute of this war, Wardlow officially surrenders the Conch republic to the United States, and, um, he went to a Navy base and surrendered right and then requests a $1,000,000,000 in aid foreign aid from the U. S. To rebuild after the war. Pretty great. It is great. Of course, the U S didn't give him a dime. Did you ever see that movie? The mouse that roared? I did. It was Peter Sellers the same thing. Yeah, s o I I'm guarantee Wardlow saw that. Probably, um, so he The U. S didn't give any of this foreign aid. There was an ascent given, but that roadblock ended almost immediately. Yeah, very quickly afterward. So have the effect that he was looking for. That's right. And they still celebrated. Today, they will issue a passport to you for the conch republic I saw and I couldn't verify this. I saw the same thing in multiple places. So, you know, it's like, yeah, sure that they'll stamp your passport. Really? Which I'm like, I I'm sure they do. But do you want them to do that? Because I could see us Customs being like What is this your passports void? Now? You can't just go stamping a passport with whatever you want. That's what I would think that, of course I'm not feeling it all. There's a Pokemon stamp on the next page. I probably shouldn't have told you that. Oh, I imagine that customs has seen a conqueror public stamp. I How about this if we have any customs agents for the U. S. Listening. Okay. If you get your passport stamp of the Conch republic or some other made up stamp Pokemon, whatever, like does it you know what he did? Invalidate your passport. You know, customs officers were famous for their sense of humor. Sure. They're just tickled by just about anything s o. They also fly a, um, a flag with the motto We succeeded where others failed. This is just And then every April, they they celebrate still their little nutty down there in Key West. Well, they are island people. Yeah, they celebrate the independence of the Conch republic. Still in April? Yeah, for like, nine days. And I looked. There's a good chance to party down there. Sure. There was a guy named Peter Anderson. Who? Ah, was the Prime Minister. No, I'm sorry. He was the secretary general of the Conch Republic, and he was like, a guiding light, keeping things going. And he died. This still they still do it. I thought maybe they were to discontinue too, but they still keep it up. Have you ever been down there? Yeah. I've never been to Key West. I did not realize they don't have beaches. And that's what we went there for. Were kind of surprised. Is it just like a little Rocky Island is a rock. And buddy, if you like to fish or scuba dive or drink, you're gonna love it down there. If you go for beaches, you're gonna be unpleasantly surprised. I like to drink. Yeah, well, you should take up scuba divers snorkeling that much of a fisherman never was like a fisherman's paradise. There it's It's one of the most otherworldly looking places I've ever been. It's like a rock coming out of like the ocean. Uh, yeah, an ocean so blue it doesn't It doesn't even look really amazing. It's a neat place them like There's a really crazy, awesome like gay community there. I'm sure you've seen on CNN and on New Year's Eve. That's right, Um, and it's just a cool place. It's a neat place, but I like the keys in general. 01 other thing. If you go down there, there is a museum. I think it's just called the Key West Museum, but it having layer? No, there's Hemingway's house. This is different. This is some weird, clunky museum that it's almost like somebody who's never been to a museum said, I'm gonna put a museum together, and this is what they came up with. There's rooms where you like. Is this a storage room? Or is this like part of the museum? It's in an old stone fort, but there's this one exhibit. There's a bunch of them. There's Robert, the famous doll, Um, who's like, Haunting, cursed They have him there. It's really neat to see, but there's one exhibit is just amazing. There was a famous key West resident who engaged in necrophilia for decades with the love of his life. Could not let her go. Um, and there's like a whole thing on him there. That's really neat. And they redid this mannequin that he basically turned his wife into trying to preserve her. Wow. Definitely worth going to. Well, if we're plugging very quickly, weird museums and I should plug the Museum of Umbrella covers. What? And that is on Peaks Island, Maine, right off of Portland, Maine. OK, take the ferry out. Two Peaks Island. Sure. Go to the Museum of Umbrella covers, not umbrellas, umbrella covers, relic covers. I don't even know there was Put your umbrella in a little sleeve. Yeah, that's it. Okay. It's like he's got a bunch of So there you have it from Chuck. That's right. uh, if you want. No, we don't do that on this doing now. Short stuff out, huh?

Radios have stuff, works Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark and there's Charles W. Chuck. Brian, There's guest producer Andrew over there on. And, um, this is stuffy snow. Everybody really really Edition, but not the online consignment retailer. Just meaning riel twice over. That's right. Very really. Yeah. Not augmented it anyway, as malefactor about his low tech as it comes as faras podcast go. Oh, I think I'll podcasts are pretty low tech right now. Some people really kind of, you know, jazz it up a little razzle dazzle. Sure, but could you imagine a world where someone listens to stuff you should know and they're wearing headset, all right? And in front of their face, it was either us. All right, what we're talking about or any of a mix of those things. I like the second idea or what we're talking about. Or if it was an animated version of us members, animated shorts. Yeah, cash. Those were good. Yeah. And, you know, we have a mutual friend, uh, who I will tell. Name off air to you. Who was getting into this quite a few years ago with another company and came to me and was like, Hey, what do you think about Maybe one day you and Josh you know, doing these shooting videos in the first? I was like, Nope, No hearing out. Ah, shooting videos to where we were. Let's say, walking people on a virtual tour of, like, a neighborhood in New York City and telling about the history in the way that we d'oh and stuff. Well, man, that would be awesome. You think? Yes, dude, I think people would love that. I would love that. Well, this person was also a big believer in a R and said, Dude, in a few years you won't be ableto buy a pair of glasses or sunglasses that don't have this built in. Yeah, I don't think your friend is right. Well, no, this was a few years ago. It's like it. It should be happening right now, according to this person, right? Yeah, I remember the time thinking, not only will that not happen in a few years, but that will never happen. I don't know, man. I don't know, I So I see what you're saying. Like with a lot of tech. There's like, you know, in five years this is going to be all the rage in the five years comes and goes and we're not that much further along. But if you step back and look at the progress that augmented reality is making yes. Um, it's I think your friend is ultimately going to be proven right. Maybe not over the same timeframe, obviously, because they totally failed with their prediction. But I think in the end your friend will be vindicated. I didn't hear a thing. I hope is this somebody. Is this somebody that I like, as I hope it's not someone I dislike, And I was indicating them because I feel like I'm trapped here. Here's my prediction is that in the future there could be for sure, people that are into this and that you can easily buy glasses like this, right? But I think the notion that this is all of humans at some point walking around like this is silly. We'll see. We'll see. We'll revisit this in five years, and I think things will be a lot different than I think you'll be singing a different tune walking around with your V R glasses on mark the date. Everyone okay, five years from now. Yep. I'm not going to say I'll buy everyone a beer If that Dalek country, Halloween 2024. Yeah, that's five years from now. If we don't look out of our house and see everybody walking around with living a virtual augmented world, right? Or I guess it's possible that that could also be the title of Ah Rob Zombie movie to Halloween 2024. There's nothing but augmented Michael Myers everywhere. That's true. I just wanted to go ahead and guest foreshadow my future pooh poohing. Okay, that's fine. That's fine. That's easy to do when you're talking about predictions, but I guess we should probably tell everybody what we're talking about. Augmented reality. It's in the title, so you should have some heads up. But Thio give kind of a brief definition of augmented reality augmented reality. I'm gonna say it 1/4 time here. Augmented reality is a type of technology that adds like a digital layer computer generated layer of, um, augmentation to real life, and it could be really, actually any kind of sensory input. Typically, it's something visual, but it could also be haptic feedback, so tactile like touch. Sure, it can be, um, sound. You could be walking through a certain place that will trigger like a sound. Eventually, it might be smells, um, warmth. Who knows what we'll be able to do? But right now, most people are typically talking about visual stuff. Yeah, well, they could combine. Ah, the I smell with v r a r. I'd love that idea, man. I think the Iceman was just ahead of its time. Not that it was a bad idea. They've already got music. They've had that since the Walkman. E guess that's a primitive a our share. So I don't know that I would call a sound a r except for the fact that maybe you could look at something and it's triggered right? But it's all there. It's already to have us leave our material world on a daily basis and go somewhere else entirely. Well, that, technically is virtual reality, where you're plunged into an entirely alternative version of reality. Augmented. Reality is it's really it's our normal reality. But there's there's an extra little touch to it that's digitized. Yeah, but the videos that I've seen there was so much going on, I, in my opinion, you are leaving the real world. Gotcha. I'm not saying you're transported to, You know, Venus or anything. But when you're sitting in a room and there are screens all in front of your face and the couch is, you know, you can change your couch to a different fabric, virtually like I don't consider that the real world. Okay, I I think that you're might be in the minority, but Okay. Oh, I think we'll see in five years that I'm not Okay, so if you if you kind of like, well, I still don't I don't quite get it. What we're talking about is Pokemon. Go basically. Yeah. So Pokemon go In 2016 it was an enormous hit. It's this game where you walk around and you basically play Pokemon in the real world, you go visit with Pokemon creatures and try to capture him and like your scores as shown on the screen of your phone and you're using your camera, and it's adding that digitized Pokemon layer to the real world you're seeing through your camera screen, right? And it was huge. Apparently it just past the $3 billion mark, which is a pretty pretty substantial profit made for a game that's actually free. It's a free game, but there's a lot of in app purchases, and they've made $3 billion off of that so far. So there's a huge appetite. Four. Augmon reality that Pokemon go showed everyone. Oh, for sure. I think there are plenty of applications. Four augmented reality in the future, right? And so we kind of got into it a little bit. The difference between virtual reality augmented reality have seen it put really well in that virtual reality takes the user anywhere. An augmented reality brings everything to the user. Um, I think that's a great description, but the ideas in V. R. You're transported to a different world in augmented reality. Your World is has that digitized layer added to it. And then there's also something called mixed reality which, if you read about it, that, to me, is that's the future of augmented reality. Yeah, I wasn't quite sure. The exact difference here it seems like very fine lines. Definition wise, it is because augmented reality and mixed reality are virtually the same thing, is just mixed. Reality is kind of like the, um, more sophisticated version of augmented reality, but a good example that kind of distinguishes. The two that I've seen is, um, let's say that you are You have your augmented reality phone going and you hold the soup can up in front of it. Okay, well, your your app says, Oh, it's the soup, you know, it's Campbell's low sodium tomato soup. Obviously, user friend who's holding the phone up to the soup cam wants to know more about this soup, and it triggers like some nutrition facts that aren't found on the label or maybe a recipe or something like that. And when you're looking at this soup can through your phone, the additional layer of information that's digitized over that makes it augmented reality. It doesn't look like it's on the soup can. Now. It's just like a little. It's like you're looking at your computer screen, but it's in front of your face. Yeah, we're kind of yes, but not nearly sophisticated. That's a different thing that will get into later. But it's just kind of like this layer of information that's just floating in space over there. Mixed reality is far more sophisticated where if you, um, held your hand up in front of in between the soup can and your phone your your hand would would what's called occlude. It would cover up that information. That's a big thing. And it's really, really hard to do, but it makes the the stuff that digitized layer of augmented reality interact with reality that much more so it could wrap around the soup can. It could be covered up by something that comes in between you and it. Um, that's mixed reality. And that's really ultimately what augmented reality will be in the future. That's right. Ah, well, see, I'm starting to suspect you have a real opinion about this. No, again, I think they're totally people. The same people that loved Google Glass, which we'll get to later. Uh, where is at the time? I was like, This is not gonna work. I'm gonna I think you're wrong. I'm gonna argue against your argument. Great. Later on L a bit. Okay. So, um, we can explain a little bit about how this works. It is we're not tech experts on, and we're not going to go by there. Jonathan Strickland right now. No. Or bother ourselves, frankly, but we can give you sort of a brief the briefest Lehman's overview of how this stuff works. There's, ah, field of I mean, there's a lot of disciplines in it called computer vision that's really super complicated, but for our purposes, I guess we can just say that computer vision basically, ah understands what's going on in the world around whoever is using the augmented reality, and they do this by you know, there's there's got to be an interaction and we'll talk about the wearables and the headsets and stuff. A supposed to smartphones. But what they use is something called the Time of Flight Sensor, which is sort of works like bats use echolocation acceptance, not echo location. It's infrared light, so they bounce to this light. And if you look at these things, it looks like a almost like a little GoPro camera or something like that, right on your forehead, which sends out these pulses of light that are reflected by the objects around you. And then it measures the delay of that light reflecting back to you to calculate, you know, everything basically the depth of everything around you, right, And then every time it makes this measurement, it also says I'm a dork. That's right, because you're wearing this on your forehead, right? And we also see what two eyes we have binocular vision. So in order to simulate that they have something called stereo cameras that are, you know, basically place. Like your eyeballs are a two fixed distance and then triangulate ce everything together to work with your two eyeballs, right? Exactly. So if you look at that, if you have a new iPhone, if you look at the back, you'll see that there's two cameras on the back. Um, some cameras, I think. Who way? Highway. I can't remember how to pronounce it. They have, ah, phone with three cameras, but I think the new iPhone does too. Now does it? Okay, um, but the input from these cameras are providing slightly different information to the onboard brain on your phone. And so it uses this different information to triangulate. Basically, um, differentiates between the information and says, Okay, this is how far away this this thing is. There this wall is or this, you know, walkway goes and it uses that information to create, um, the digitized layer that that is augmented reality within the space that it realizes it's looking at. It's like, Okay, this is what I have to work with Let's get rendering And that's the next step is rendering, which could be a simple as, um adding, like that layer of text in front of you when you hold up that soup can. Or it could be far, far more sophisticated, like, say, using a Snapchat filter that makes you look like you're wearing a cute little cat mask. But no matter where you move your face up and down, or if you open your mouth or something like that, it follows it perfectly, which would actually technically make the Snapchat filter mixed reality rather than augmented reality. Yeah, I don't do the Snapchat thing, but you can do that on FaceTime. And I made the mistake of doing that. Face timing. Ah, my kid. And now that's all she wants to do when I will share this time. Yeah, is be a monkey or a dinosaur in our ally and her worthless turd or a robot or whatever you are, which is kind of fun. And it is, you know, Ah, it is pretty amazing that on this little phone you can stick your tongue out and wrinkle your eyes. And you can do that as a kitty cat or a monkey in real time. And so it does all this because of all the face for facial recognition. Um, software aboard your phone. Um, the gyroscope. You know where you're, like, who crew needs a compass. So I'm not gonna walk around in the woods with this thing. Well, there's that all the time. Actually, you really? Yeah. I mean, I'm not in the woods, but you know me, I'm a terrible sense of direction. So if I'm in New York or wherever and I'm like I need to go north, then it's very simple way to find out. Yeah, true. But I've always just used maps, and it's really good for maps. That's how it knows which way you're facing. Is that gyroscope in GPS coordinates? So it's using all of this stuff, um, along with facial recognition, to to map and track where you're moving. And no matter whether it's rendering the soup can information or the Snapchat filter, Um, it does this. It does all these calculations and figures out where what's going on in the room in your motion and where your face is or where the suit can is all that stuff. It does it every time the camera sends a frame of info to the to the onboard computer on your phone, which happens 30 times per second. So these calculations are being adjusted, analyzed and re measured, and then the output is being put out 30 times per second, which is pretty impressive. You know what I think you just hit on the key difference in our outlook on this. What it sounds like you are primed for a R because I am someone. If I'm in New York, let's say and I will say, I will say, Uh, all right, I know I need to go North East to get to this place. Yeah, so I'll just chart what Northeast is. Put the phone in my pocket and I'll start walking. Start. We'll hook. And I think you're more prime to look at your map and go along the streets that it's telling you to go on. I listen to the computers what you're saying? No, not necessarily. But like that, I think those were two distinct differences of like kinds of people and how they interact with technology in the world around them. Whereas I just want to know I'm going northeast. And that's correct, right? A lot of people are wanted to look at that map the whole way, and now they're going like on the exact right street to get them there. So I guess the quickest right. Which one do you think is correct? I don't know. I mean, I like to meander, and I like me and doing to I'm with you, too, for sure. But I also use ways like everywhere I drive to have never used it. It's really helpful, But I don't I don't just like I don't sit there and, like, follow the ways app or anything like I'm looking out the window. So I would say I'm somewhere between between you and like a Pokemon go player. Well, I Dr Emily crazy, because I am quite comfortable. Get it unless I'm in a hurry, not getting some places quickly as possible. And she's always like, Where you going? I'm like, we'll get there eventually. I like that too. I like that too. So don't mistake me, but I'm somewhere in the middle. But yes, I feel like I'm a little more, um, into tacky or, um, exploited by tech than you are saying, Where did we leave off here? Um uh what? The two types of augmented reality? Yeah, that we did you say those know we haven't talked about OK, because I was just about to talk about marker and marker less. Yeah, those were the two broad categories. Yeah, and these, mean, is very simple. And it makes a lot of sense. Marker based is basically if something is sort of pre programmed and loaded into your program or your app for your phone and it knows, You know, once you look up at that thing like the New York Public Library, if you're let's say you have an app about New York history, I keep picking on New York here because it's easy. Well, we were just there, too. Yeah, that's right. So, uh, it would have something preloaded about the New York public Library that will pop up in front of your face. All right. It recognizes the library goes Oh, I know that thing. Yeah, exactly. And it spits out the information. It's a marker. Yeah, or, you know, could be a Q R code. Um, marker looks can don't forget Super Hans Chuck out to know those soup recipes, right? It's add water, right? Don't even add water. I think you're a chump if you add water to condense suit because it's condensed to perfection. If you ask me, how do you just do the straight up? Uh, yeah, I'd like it to not run off the spoon when you hold the spoon upside down. Wow. All right, it depends on the soup. Actually, I'm I'm kidding, but I I have eaten soup that I have not added water to. I will use a little less water, like in a Let's say, Campbell's chicken noodle. Sometimes you can get a little watery, so I'll use, like, 3/4 of a can. Maybe. Hey, I've got one for you. Have you ever had progress owes? I I don't remember. It's like supposedly they're like healthier version or whatever, but they have a creamy chicken. Noodle is good. It's amazing you, me got it, and I just happen to be like what's in the pantry. All open this and I ate it and I I like it so much that I would have felt bad not mentioning it since we're talking about soup. Yeah, I'm a fan of canned soup of having that around. Yeah, it is that time of year to it is it's candy time of year. Everyone no one ever eats can gazpacho in the summer. Canned soup is like a fall winter kind of thing. This episode brought to you by progress. Oh, it's that time of year, everyone. I wish it were that easy. Uh, where were we? Mark Earless is a little bit different and a little bit trickier. Uh, basically means there are no markers, so your device actually has actually recognize things and be smart enough to say that's a soup can. Ah, and it's not pre programmed in, but I know what a soup can looks like. So here's what you do is add water, right? Exactly. So, um, that Pokemon go apparently did that, For example, when you were walking by a river, Yeah, it would say, Oh, I recognise a river or I recognize this bit of land or something like that, and it doesn't have actual markers at a pre program. It's just smart enough tea. No river when it sees a river, and it will show you like a water loving Pokemon like Gira dose or something like that. Oh, boy. All right, let's take a break. I'm gonna forget that ever happened. We'll talk about the history right after this. You know, you should know. So, my friend, would you judge me if I bought that sea by G e d lighting but didn't gift it and kept it for myself? Like you go to buy it for somebody. But you just never actually give it to him. Yeah, I'm asking for a friend. Okay. Well, I don't think I could judge you. Really? Anybody could judge you for that, because what we're talking about is si bi g lighting, which allows you to connect, control and automate your lighting with a full suite of smart products. How could you be blamed for wanting to keep that for yourself? Chuck? That's right. Because it gives you the ability to set lights, trees and decorations to your schedule, keeping things merry and bright, the ability to turn them on automatically to the perfect brightness every single morning without waking guests. And don't forget, you can control your lights and appliances remotely through your phone, which means that what we're talking about is the future. I feel like you definitely just sold yourself on these sea by G e Smart home products. I kind of did. I think I'm going to actually buy several for friends, and one of them might not make it. I get that urge. Well, if you two are interested in transitioning your home quickly and easily into a smart home visit, see by g e dot com. That's the letter C be Why g dot com So there's this brand new, right? Yes, although you knew no one has ever done anything with augmented reality until Pokemon go in 2016. I thought it was interesting, though, that the very common thing that people might not think about football fans is that that first down line. Ah, and now they have all kinds of stuff, like yards to go, to make a kick, maybe, and stuff like that. But they're overlays. We talked about that on some other show. Some other episode I can't remember. I couldn't remember which one it was either, but we've definitely talked about it. Yeah, but those screen overlays and from 1998 is when they debuted Sports Vision, that glowing line that is augmented reality. It is the kind I can get down with, right? Well, that's the So that works because you can only see it from one point of view, right? So it really works on TV because you can only see from one point of view, which is the camera's point of view when you're watching TV works really well and you can overlay all sorts of cool stuff. But, um, what differentiates that from the augmented reality that's coming around today is that in this in the stands or whatever, maybe they can project it. So, you know, you could see it from one angle, Um, in the future, meaning, like six months from now, everybody will be sitting around in a football stadium, and they will be able to see the first down line from whatever their vantage point. Our point of view is by looking through their phone for their Hedley. Yeah, their head said. Eventually, I'll bet if there's not a nap out that you can do that with your phone yet. I'm it's coming. Yeah, yeah, very soon. I'm sure I'm surprised they haven't over laid ads on the field and stuff. I'm surprised by that. To which will probably push things forward as well. Advertising. Sure. So that was 1998 that the first down line came out. But it goes back way further than, as a matter of fact, 30 years before that. There is a guy named Ivan Sutherland who is a computer scientist, and he came up with a headset that you wore, Um, that looks a lot like a scary, clunky old turn of the century version of a V R headset. But it dropped you into these, like wire frame rooms, wire frame like a line drawn computer generated line drawn like Tron ish kind of rooms. I was gonna say battle zone, But sure, um, I don't know. That is No, it was It was another arcade game where you put your face into a ah into ah sort of a headset. Oh, yeah. Was it like a battleship? Yeah. They were like tanks and things, but it was green wire frame. It was sort of three d looking and ah, you controlled that your tank with two two controllers like shifting controllers. I got you. I'm thinking of the one where you It was like you're looking through a periscope, and you had to, like, torpedo, um, ship. So, like, you're like, you're the joystick where two handles coming off of, like, the periscope face plate that you're putting a face up to. Do you remember that one? I do. What was that one? I don't remember. It was probably just called periscope for something stupid. Like that sub submarine bomb. Maybe. Maybe I don't think you said what year was for. I've been selling, though. That was the summer of love. My friends was 1968. I thought 69 was the summer of love. I mean, in a joke. No, I really wasn't. But now I'm blushing. I didn't mean that. I think is what I'm saying. Like, these things just kind of happened to me. I'm a victim. I think 68 was the summer of love. I might be wrong. Well, let's just say both for okay. 69 was put post coital right? Or pre. Wow. Uh, so there was another, um, researcher in 1974 named Myron Kruger at UConn sounds like a Halloween villain, and he sounds like a seventies computer researcher if I've ever heard vibrant Kruger. Yeah, that's true. The crew eggs. He, ah, invented something called video place, which, if you look up, is kind of fun to look at, too. It was interactive and just think of the most rudimentary V are you could think of, um, which is like someone going up to like a 19 seventies apple computer. Right? There was such a thing, and being able to touch the screen to make something happen very, very rudimentary, very rudimentary. But for the seventies in particular, this is, like, really ahead of its time. And, like, you know, um, Ivan Sutherland admiring Kruger, they were both working in in computer science labs, just generating, like proof of concept, the fact that this was even possible. And here's a Here's a possible path forward to this, um, and then that's kind of how things like augmented reality get pushed forward is the people who figure out how to do it in the clunky ist most primitive way possible. And then, over time, other researchers and other students come along, and they figure out how to shrink it down. And then the next thing you know, you have a smartphone that's capable of doing this kind of thing. And that's really where V. R. Just took a an enormous leap. Forward was when the first smartphone started to come out because if it weren't for smartphones, we would still be pressing like bed sheets. Yeah, at Video place, you know what I mean? But the fact that smartphones were able to carry the hardware needed, like things like onboard cameras and gyroscopes and GPS coordinates and connections to the Internet the fact that all this was suddenly in the Palm people's hands, people said, Well, we should start doing things with with this. Yeah, and I'm not knocking those those early pioneers, like, I think that's the coolest part about any anything like this is the people that were brave enough to say, like Hey, put this microwave on your head right, and this is the future, You know, um, if you want to talk about an adorable presentation, you could go back to February 2009 and look at the Ted talk on six cents. It's really great because things were smaller, but they still didn't know howto like Bring it all together in one small like thing they had to Kabul a bunch of stuff together, right? So they had, like, a camera that you wore around your neck. It like chest height. You had a smartphone, you had a mirror. You had initially a projector strapped to a helmet that you were on your head dork, and it was all strung together. And you wore these little colored caps on your fingers. Ah, to be able to interact with the thing that the projector on your head was admitting they do they work for that. They also work really well to keep your fingers clean when you're eating Buffalo wings. I used to work with a commercial director named Tom Schiller, who was one of my idols because he was an early writer for Saturday Night Live and did all those old black and white SNL things with Belushi. Sure, yeah, and Schiller was great, and he kind of took me under his wing, and I want to get in touch with the guy again. But he wore ah, just a za gag. He would walk around on set and eat Cheetos with a surgical glove. Oh, nice. And he told me one day I was like, Man, that's so funny. And he went I don't even like Cheetos. He's like, I just do it for the gag. It's pretty great. Get, um, those So they make surgical gloves. That air Just fingertip protectors. Uh, and you me got me some of those in one time. We went out to you with a friend and I was eating buffalo wings like that. Continue. Really? Yeah. And he like it. Didn't say anything that make a big deal out of it. Just looked over it. I just lost it. It was pretty great. It was. It went about as good as you can hope. I think I've seen those one of those four. I don't know, man. I don't know. But I can tell you, they really do work for eating Buffalo Wing. For some reason, I remember my grandmother had those when I was a kid, and I think it may have been like, ah, to protect a cut or something if you're washing dishes. Or maybe that's what she used him for. Sure, I think it's one of those things where it's like we're just gonna manufacturers and put him out there in the world and, you know, whatever, using weather, whatever you whatever you want. Of course, this is the mid seventies. This is pre buffalo Wing, uh, when we're okay. I was about to get crazy. I just wanted to rile up all the people in Buffalo, New York. So, yes, you're wearing these caps on your fingers That is used, T o. You know, act is your go between and manipulate the images. That projector on your head is showing everywhere, which is kind of cool, cause it's on your head, right, So anything can be turned into a surface. Sure. Like I mean, ideally, you're looking at a white wall, right? Or your wrist was one that they used to like. You could put like a numeric keypad projected onto your wrist, which is neat, but it doesn't mean anything unless if you press the numbers, it does something. And that's where those finger caps came in. Like the allowed the camera to track what your fingers were doing. And that was a really, really big proof proof of concept that Oh, yeah, since put out there, which is tracking how we move because there's a difference between just adding a layer of recipes on your soup can and being able to swipe through recipes just by making a gesture in the air with your finger and rat with something that six cents show could be done and that is starting to show up on phones as well. Where now you know, you squeeze your phone like the screen your phone. It's using all sorts of sensors and pressure gauges and, um, vibration measurements to to figure out what you're doing with your fingers. Now they're starting to track it, using things like the infrared ah, time of flight camera so that you don't actually touch your your screen. You just kind of make these gestures above it. And when, when that becomes further and further developed, that will very clearly be used for a are in the future, Yeah, and is kind of funny and clunky. Something from 2009 appears now, Just 10 years ago, Just scrub through to the end of that Ted talk and see the audience go wild like that. That's the cool thing about this early tech of the people of these Ted talks, man, they can see it. They can see the future because they know they can see beyond the fact that you've got six different things hanging around your neck and strapped to your head. Sure, it's the proof of concept because, like you said, they can always package it in the future in a nice, little tidy thing that you can sell. Well, everybody knows that Ted talks were populated by only the best people. Only the best, huh? So there's a lot of this going on now all around you, beyond the NFL, on the football field, The way they use that stuff too, right? Yeah. I think everybody uses that that glowing line for first downs. And remember, they had it following the hockey puck for a little while. They last it didn't. And I specifically remember we talked about that too. Wherever we talked about this before, you lucky fans were like e. I don't like it. Yeah, I don't want my puck to glow. Um, but the kind of has popped up here, there and all sorts of random places. There was an esquire cover once where when you waved your smartphone over it. Using the APP Robert Downey Jr would start talking to you. Um, there's Starbucks, Valentine's. You could send where you like, looked at a cup and it would say, Hey, be my valentine or something stupid like that. There was a theatre production in the nineties called Dancing in Cyberspace. Amazing people are like, Oh, you can do stuff like this. So let me figure out a neat way to use it. But it hadn't really started to accumulate until the last probably five or seven or 10 years when people really started throwing money at a our development in an APP creation. Yeah. I mean, one of you know, I use some of this stuff here and there. Um, I'm not like a total poop were. I'm just saying I'm never gonna walk around the world with a headset on. I don't think that that's correct. Oh, man, I will not do it just despite, you know, like a no, it's correct. But it wouldn't have been had I not said had I just been like Sure, sure, of course, he'll he'll be doing stories on the Last man on Earth. Do not do this right I wish I could go back and edit out your mind. You're there because this is one time I would do it. Ah, but I like stuff like the sky maps these apse where you can go out at night time or in the daytime. But it's one run at night. Sure, And look at the stars and hold up your phone. And, um, see what? What Planets and constellations were out there and tap on one to get information. Stuff like that's really need my uncle. Ah, are rather guess Emily's uncle Tim came to visit to not too long ago and he looked over, was with, um with my kid showing her the room around him. And I was like, All right, what's that all about? And I went over and looked and I don't know what the program was, but it was just the walls were dripping with blood and dweller that wasn't there. But it very well could have been because there were, like, sharp. You're like an aquarium. There were sharks, fish and all these things, and she just of course, it blew her mind. Sure, but this is the world that she's growing up In the end, it'll be totally normal there that in that application when she's in her twenties, will seem as primitive and clunky as a Walkman does today. Oh, for sure, you know. Oh, I mean, it looks clunky now. Yeah, I would say I would say so. How about like people walking around with the photograph? We're going to say that one. Instead. I'm going to just double down even more triple down, I guess you could say triple down. There are also other applications, like there's one for the for the Gatwick Airport. It's a passenger app where you can hold it up and find out information about wait times and where the restrooms are, where you know where the restaurant you want to go to is. Yeah, there's also one that's helpful are. Actually there's a handful of them where, like you remember where you parked your car, and then when you're walking through a parking lot, there's like a big giant like arrow or something over your car that you just walk towards. I would use that. Go ahead, but because it's out there right now, I use the primitive version now, which is just take a picture of the, uh, the road number. Knowing you, you probably like just car of a picture into a piece of tree bark, and then Rohit will use your You'll use your phone to know where you know what direction and car is so you can walk into No, man, I'll drop a pin. I'm not a total Luddite. The military, obviously with anything tech, is where a lot of the application goes. Um, they are. They have something called synthetic training environments where you can fully Ah, well, they're a couple of ways to use that. You can fully practice stuff like you could practice Ah, raid on a terrorist compound over and over again. Um, with, like as much information as you have about the compound and the building, you can build that out virtually. Or you can potentially at some point, have soldiers on the field that where this stuff and look up and have overlays of, uh, you know, stuff beamed down from satellites, about blueprints or just information bring, you know, instead of hearing it to your walkie talkie or whatever. Yeah, you know how like when you zoom in at us and you accidentally like move your your thumbs in a certain way. All of a sudden, the street map. I think Google maps, like, becomes three dimensional like you're kind of looking at it in a little bit of a three. Well, you wouldn't know everyone else Listening to this episode knows what I'm talking about. Um, but that's what they're saying. Like you could be on a battlefield and all of a sudden there's like a three dimensional visual ization of what's ahead that you can know where to go. That's right. And it will show you where your car is parked, which is great or potentially. Ah, my friend was working on an app in Los Angeles for, like, music festivals. Uh, you can find your friends. Yeah, stuff like that. Well, that's one that's that kind of pops up for something called Wick itude. And this is Ah, it's a pretty good example of, ah, an entire kind of type of augmented reality app where you're just are looking at the world around you, and it shows you all sorts of different information. So, like a building you're passing might have a restaurant in it, and it will show you like the daily specials for that restaurant. And then over here, there's somebody walking down the street, and it has their twitter handle over their head. Um, and then there's, ah, you know, like the hotel rates for a hotel down the street. And all of this stuff is right there on your phone, which is pretty amazing. But, um, I guess I hopefully you have to opt in for your twitter handle toe, like, be shown in an app like this. But that's a really good example of an entire variety of apse, which is just basically like that overlay of information, additional information about the world around us as we're moving through it. Yeah, And I could see a world where and this is what I told our mutual friend because he was just, like, what applications Could you see what could be cool? It was like I could get, I guess I could see. Like if you go to the Museum of Natural History, you could load up anyone from Jerry Seinfeld, tow us, tow us to be your dose it for the day. We we could dress like Teddy Roosevelt. Good. Yeah. Or you could just point your camera at someone and addresses them is Teddy Roosevelt because that's the thing. If that's not a thing, it's about to be next week. I'm sure s so I could see applications like that, um, historically walking around the neighborhood, getting information instead of, um, going through the trouble to read the plaque by the statue. Yeah, for sure. But, um, there's also when there's one for Pompeii that somebody built. That's where you hover over the ruins and you look at your screen and it shows you what the building looked like before Pompeii was destroyed. Yeah, that's gonna cool. Yeah. So there's a lot of you know, um, really great applications already for learning about our world. My prediction is that is what our worlds is gonna look like when you're walking on the street or walking around a historical site. You're walking anywhere. You're going to be inundated with information like that. And I think you will be able to curate it yourself where you select say, you know, if your instagram user and you don't really use Twitter, well, it wouldn't show you people Twitter handles. It would show you their instagram handles or, um, if you if it knew you were looking for a hotel hotels dot com would would show you rates, but it wouldn't otherwise, like, if if it was in the city that you live in or something like that, Like you, it will be ultra Taylor to the to the individual. Yeah, they would never just feed you content that you didn't want to see automatically, right? Exactly. No one. No one does that. No. Ah, healthcare is obviously a big, big field for a R. Because you can do practice surgeries that aren't just generic. You can do it very specific to the person there are. Maybe the situation is like somebody could come in and have a wound. And they could point a camera or, you know, your phone a phone. I guess I would imagine the hospital have something a little more advanced, but maybe not. I don't think you need it. You think you just need a smartphone? I just think they would gussy it up, at least, So you didn't feel like what you did. You set that down on a food tray on an airplane. I mean, like, is that thing clean? but it would look at the wound. And it would send a message that says you're screwed or yes or your great. Yeah, the, um uh, yeah, one of them. One of the diagnoses is you. Yeah, but reading about this, I was like, I guess I'll go look up images of wounds for a little while. And I did. Did you really? Sometimes I can't help myself whenever I see the word wound. If I'm researching, I'll just be like, let's go see what some wound pictures look like. I'll do that. And Emily always is like, What do you do that? It's like picking at a scab or something. It's tough. Not too well. And I also argued this just happened the other day. I was like, You know, it's that same curiosity that, like, is why Josh and I do what we do for a living. Yeah, the same one that also kills cats, right? Ah, what are some other great applications if you're have sensory impairments, that is huge. Yeah, yeah. I want to give a shout out real quick here because I got this from this article called. 39 ways. Augmented reality can change the world in the next five years. And it's by yet see Weiner on Thrive. Global Medium, huh? It's a lot of words I just spit out, but they all make sense eventually, if you type them into Google. Um, and the itsy wiener, I guess, asked like 39 different people what they thought about the future of a R and stuff that's just around the corner. And this was one of them. Yeah, if you think about if you have partial vision and it can actually help you to see you know it can make things pop more and edges more visible, it's, you know, it's not gonna restore vision, obviously, but it can actually help out partially sighted people. Yeah, or if you have a hearing impairment, Um, you can say walk around and it'll say, Oh, there's a train coming because that hears the sound of a train, you know, flash on your screen, maybe a picture of a train or just the word train or something like that. There's a lot of applications for that that will basically, um uh, cure is not the right word, but that will make a living in, you know, Ah, the world so much easier for people with disabilities that it's just that's a really exciting thing. Two and dropping is also excited. Well, that's probably a cz. Muchas. The military's funding will push this technology forward. Retail will be at least as big a contributors. Well, and it already is like some of the coolest V r wraps around or ones that help us consume better. Yeah, I mean, I definitely see this happening, Um, all around us and in the near future, even more and more, you walk into a store, you're shopping for a couch, let's say, and you can, um, you can see what that couch might look like in your home, or if it fits through your door or in your space, or your glasses look like instead of trying them on right. They don't have them in the store. You can virtually try them on. Yeah, and you don't even have to leave your home either, to another way to do it is like you could just hold your phone up and you condone, you know, look at the space where you want a couch to go and select that couch, and it'll show up and you'll be able to see what it looks like in that space. Yes, and I'm sure it will be complete with suggested purchases and add ons. Right. You'll just be ableto like click it you see in purchase it and it'll show up at your house. And you might also want this ottoman in this throw rug, right? The Yeah, Yeah, you're right about talking about yet for sure. Um, but the the idea that all of this that our world are augmented world in the not too distant future is going to be very personalized. That kind of comes through to one of those people that yet see Wiener spoke to which, by the way, it's the wiener has one of the better names of all time. Um, you see, Reno spoke to somebody who said, You know, this is gonna be really personalized. So this a our world that you're experiencing if you go to a restaurant that a friend recommended, they might have left like a recommendation for a dish for you to eat, just scrawled on the wall. And no one else would be able to see it because your friend left it for you. But this is This is like the kind of personalization that will have, or if you walk into a store, and rather than like tailored ads coming up in your in your Web. Searches like tailored ads will come up in your field of view where it's like, Hey, we heard that you were talking about this. Ah, this Depeche Mode album. Well, it just happens to be right there. Even though nobody buys albums anymore, go buy it. Because this is a terrible example. But you get what I'm saying. That's what the ad will say. You get what I'm saying. All right, let's take our last break here, and we will talk a little bit about some of the potential pitfalls and hurdles facing a r. You know, you should know. So, Chuck, let me say something about this sea by G lighting. Right? Okay. Like it works your round. It's great. You can control the lighting your house, but it's particularly handy in the holidays. You got more lights going on? Yeah. Exact the time of the year for great lights. Yes. You could turn some on and not turn others on. You can adjust them to your schedule. You just kind of keep things merry and bright. Yes, and by bright I mean the perfect brightness for you and your needs. And you can all do this remotely through your phone. How cool is that? It is awfully cool. The ability to set the perfect scene with the touch of a button. Yeah, man. Well, you have just sold me on the C bi g e Smart home products. And if you out there in podcast land are interested in transitioning your home very quickly and very easily into a smart home, you should visit. See by g e dot com. That is the letter C b y g e dot com. Ah, uh, okay, Chuck. So ASIS, which makes, um, all sorts of tech hardware and stuff. They released a phone recently called the Zen phone A R. Yeah, and it is basically made for augmented reality. It does all the other stuff that a phone does, but it has, like an extra a bit of hardware and software that makes it like a ace augmented reality. And one of the things that has on board is Google's tango software, and tango is basically like an a r sweet. It has things like amazing motion detection area learning. Um, do you remember how we talked about marker list? They are where it's like, Oh, that's a river. Oh, that's a walkway like it's really, really good at that at determining, um, Mark Earless objects to to figure out what needs to be projected where, um and it's a really amazing phone as faras a Argos. Um, the fact that it's out there really kind of shows like people are really pouring money into this. This idea, this a r idea. Um, and eventually that is why I think it's going to hit. Yeah, those in phone looks. Ah, it's not. It's not so clunky. It's like a regular smartphone and just in the top in the center as a little bit of, ah, hardware situation, right. But it seems like it could probably still just fit into your pocket nicely, right? It's not super bulky. Nothing on your forehead. Nothing on your forehead yet. But that's the thing, though. You still need a phone, Um, and most people, not most people, but over three billion people close to, you know, inching toward 50% of the global population has a smartphone at this point, right? So that's not an issue, not the biggest issue. But there are some challenges. Ah, and they're basically boil down to hardware and bandwidth. Um, bandwidth is a really big deal right now until five g is like fully integrated. Um, it's just really tough to meet the band with needs of a R right now on the eighth day basis. Yeah, and like the kind of a r that we're talking about, where it's called always on augmented reality, where you're just walking through the world and there's just digital. That digital layer is everywhere really mixed, too, so that it's really interacting with reality in a very believable way that is, extraordinarily band with hungry. Where is like walking down the street and streaming A Um, YouTube video in HD requires something like five or six megabytes per second of bandwidth and something like 30 to 50 milliseconds of Leighton. See, which is lag time between when your phone sends a commander server and then receives the info back, That's that's That's about what it takes to watch an HD movie to stream in HD movie but with, um, with augmented reality absence, that's nothing like you wouldn't get anywhere with that Now you'd need about 100 per second bandwidth in the late in sea of one millisecond, and they think five g could solve this problem. But we'll see. I think they did definitely. Well, I think I mean, they're talking about, like, an average download speed of a gigabyte, a second peaks of like, 10 gigs a second, which is way more than enough for an a r um, in a our app. So I think five g really will help move a are long, but you still you said it early. We still have that problem with hardware. Yeah, a phone like the phone Holding your phone up in front of you is no way to move through the world. But that's basically what you have to do if you want to take part with augmented reality. Well, Google said, we have an idea. How about Google Glass? And everybody said, That's a terrible idea. Get that thing out. Yeah, this is six years ago. Remember Jonathan Strickland? I think he was sent some in his defense. I don't think he purchased them, but going definitely. He really warm a lot if I remember correctly. Yeah, that did not work out. And one of the big problems was they didn't have it fully worked out before. They said, Hey, do you want to go ahead and try this thing out? They should probably worked on a little longer, but the prototype was released as the product and they thought that this would just get such a claim that it's gonna be the next big thing. And then we'll work out the kinks as the money comes flooding in. Right? And that didn't happen. Um, because people didn't like the idea of people walking around with a camera honed on everything or themselves. No, that was a That's a big one, and it still is today. I mean, privacy is an enormous problem with, um with augmented reality, because to to be a part of it, like you have your your your your wearable or your phone or whatever has to be taking in the world around it. And that very frequently includes people. And it's like you said, Maybe there will very soon be, ah, an augmented reality app where if you look at somebody there suddenly dressed like Teddy Roosevelt. That's probably pretty innocuous, but also maybe takes their clothes off and it shows them naked right there standing in front of you. And all of a sudden you're leering at them and they know what you're looking at. And that is an enormous invasion of privacy. Plus also with a CZ much stuff as we share on social media, all that stuff couldn't be cobbled together. You're pretty amazing profile of you. And if all of that comes up when you look at somebody, when somebody comes into your field of vision while you're wearing an augmented reality wearable or something, um, that's an enormous invasion of privacy, too, especially if the person hasn't opted in for that to be shared. That's right. And they are. Here's real scary thing they're talking about A are contact lenses that you wear on your eyeballs right where this is just the world you see at all times. They're not clunky glasses. They're not headsets. Ah, you wouldn't even know that someone has. He's unnecessarily, and the problem now is they can't provide a power source, which means that they have not figured out a way to make them run on human tears right here in tears there. Um, blinking. Surely there's a way to make him work from blinking, You know what I mean? Well, yeah, I could see that. You just gotta blink a lot. Yes. So there was something that we ran across, Um, that I think if you ask me, this is why a lot of people are going to start using things like, um, augmented reality wearables or implants or something like that. There's gonna be what's called or there could be I should say, I don't mean to say gonna because it's definitely not a foregone conclusion, but there could be a, um ah, like a career arms races. How I've seen it. Put where somebody who has, like, this implant or who has gone out and bought these contact lenses or whatever, is going to be a much more productive employee than somebody who still goes to the trouble of typing out. You know how to go, You know, a Nintendo et search or something for information, and they're doing it the old school way, right? They're going to get left behind. And when you're talking about things like livelihood. People are going to say, Well, I need to go get those contact lenses there. I need to undergo that surgery to get that implant so that I can keep up in today's job market. That is what's going to get everybody into the world of a R. Yeah, And there are also clearly just dated a physical pitfalls, like walking into traffic or driving off a cliff. Because you're wearing those wearable while you're in a car or something like that. I would think that some of those are gonna start coming with, um, like you won't be able to operate it if it's moving, you know, over certain miles per hour or something. I don't know how they're gonna I don't know, man. I do not know. I do know that one of the issues that was raised about that that was the ability to hack into stuff like that. And I mean, if we're if we're just completely reliant in trusting of our app servers are a our app. Still, it kind of take us from place to place. We might stop thinking for ourselves and just kind of follow him blindly. You don't use Waze, but ways is very well known. As good as it is, um, for leading you on some real, like ding bat side side trips. Sure to save you, like 1/2 of a second. Yeah, um, and I follow him like very rarely am. I like. Okay, wait, where you taking me? And you'll scroll ahead or whatever. Look, ATT. The turns, you know, in tax. Instead, you just follow it. And, you know, you have to look over sheepishly. The people who just watched you get off on a spur and then get back on and really not get anywhere. That's a really great example. But imagine if that lead you off of a cliff or something like that. And that happens. People literally have walked off cliffs playing Pokemon go because they weren't paying attention to the real world around him. Yeah, and this isn't exactly a r. But my ah, again, Emily's uncle. I came to see us, and he has He's a drone guy and he had a setup where you could fly the drone up, and then he put a headset on me, and then I could see through the drone's camera. Mmm. So, the drones 200 feet in the air and then I can look around and operate the camera. Cool as if I was up there and I could not get that headset off of my head quickly enough. Yeah, well, that's another thing, too. I think that's another reason why that five G is gonna have to take place is like this thing needs to be as smooth as possible If people are just gonna walk around throwing up everywhere. Oh, it didn't make me sick. I just It's just not my thing, man. I was like, I want to be in the real world. I don't wanna wear a headset and look at something projected. I think I think that that is I think that will definitely be a thing, Chuck. Or there will be like there'll be a whole movement of, you know, back to reality types. Where, rather than back to nature, will be back to reality where people are like, No, we Yeah. We just want to experience reality as it is. One of the people would be like, How can you ever see what reality really is? You know what is subjective consciousness? you moon and then they'll say, You're right. We might as well just get digitized. You get anything else? I've got nothing else. Well, let's revisit this one in five years. Okay? What's the Halloween 2024? If you want to know more about augmented reality, go online and start finding APS and see what you think you'll love it. There's also a pretty good article on how stuff works you can check out to Since I said that it's time for listener. Man, this is called disagreement about trunk or treating. Okay, You had a very minor spat. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hey, guys, been listening since 2016 and consider myself a Deb. Okay, I've marveled for some time about how good natured, good natured your toward each other. Even when you disagree slightly on some of the controversial topics. I think it's important skill to have, especially in the midst of divisive ages. After over three years of listening to your dulcet tones, however, your masks finally began to slip the most unlikely of episodes drunker treating. Yeah, I thought that the disagreement over the presence of apple bobbing it drunken treating was going to boil over But being the consummate professionals, you are. You swiftly moved on. I did find the momentary annoyance in your voice is hilarious, though, and it just goes to show you to take that. You take every episode very seriously. Despite the seemingly laid back manner in which you deliver your pearls of wisdom. Have long been waiting for a conflict between the two of you because I found your on mike relationship Very funny. And the fact that the first sign of an argument came when discussing a child's Halloween event is the most stuff you should know thing that has ever happened. She even made me laugh out loud. That's awesome. So that is from London, Alex in London. Thanks, Alex. You should go back and listen to the Barbie episode. We had a little spat on that one, too, if I remember correctly, and I will say this is not a grass, water and grass level vindication, but we got at least one e mail from a guy that said, our trunk or treating has fall festival stuff, too, because yes, that's fine, he said, because the kids it would take them 15 minutes to visit the cars and that's no long enough, right? So in this case, a trunk or treating is a feature of the larger fall festival. But apple bobbing has nothing to do with trunk or treating. Let's just end this. Okay, let's do it. All right.

And for this week's s wise case elects chosen. Can we treat mental illness with psychedelics? Spoiler alert. The answer is a big, big Yes, This is one of those neat pieces of history where things just kind of fell out of place for something important. And we also have the rare luxury of seeing where it went wrong and exactly who was responsible. So enjoy this really interesting episode of stuff he should know. Welcome to step. You should know a production of I heart radio How stuff works. Whoa! And welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles. Cheech Bryant. Cheech. Yeah, man. I wanted to start this one out like a 12 year old. So that's what I'm going with. A 12 year old on acid maybe maybe which has happened before in France, actually. Really? Thanks to our old friends, the C i A. They just kids. They just the whole town to see what would happen. And one kid came at this grandmother and tried to strangle her. Really? Yeah. I can't remember the name of the town. I could you find that funny, But, um well, no, people were like showing up in the hospital right there. A lot of it was funny. Yeah, in that. Like, you know, all these 19 fifties Frenchies. Er, right, losing their stuff for no apparent reason, right? Right. But you know, the suicides that resulted yet not far from that. Not very funny. Before we get started, I think we should do like an official C away for this one. I think that is a very good idea, because what? Josh and I are about to talk about our illegal drugs, but we just find it fascinating that they used to be used for certain things, and they're starting to be used again in certain scientific research labs. For these things, it is extremely fascinating, which is what we're talking about exactly against this could be a follow up to our M K ultra cast. It's a follow up, and, uh, it's an epilogue. And a prologue. Yes. Yeah, Very nice. Because we kind of came into the the C i A l s d m k ultra podcast, like, right in the middle. Yeah. Of the history of LSD. Play out well toward the beginning. But, um, one of the things after 1943 when Ah, Albert Hoffman, right? Yes. The chemist who created LSD, LSD 25 tried it. It was his 25th attempt. Ah, and tried it on himself intravenously. As I understand it, he injected it. We always says first he took it by mistake because there was a blood thinner. And then he took it for real. Yeah, for that first bike ride home is like, gotta do some more than our readers. Quote, please. I became aware of the wonder of creation. The magnificence of nature. Yes. That create Dr Hoffman. Yeah, and he was just some Swiss guy in chemist. Um, he was that the first person to come up with a synthetic hallucinogen Varun, 1914 a German chemist who worked for Merck, the pharmaceutical company came up with m d M a better known as Ecstasy that far back, huh? Yeah. And here's a tip for you truckers. Um, any time. According to the Associated Press, you write about a designer drug and use it by its designer name capitalized. So Ecstasy is always capitalized. The word ecstasy when you're talking about the drug. Guess that. Well, sure. Yeah. And not just the euphoric feeling you get from life. That's different. Yes, this lower case. Okay, but it should be all caps. Yeah, sure. So, uh, it was 1914. The m d m a with create. That's crazy. Yeah. And it was, um I guess it served as, Ah, it's not a catalyst, cause I think it's changed. But it was to be used in the synthesis of other chemicals, and it kind of sat on the shelves for a little while until somebody along the way and did a translator. What? What happens if I take this stuff? Yeah, and they did. And the CIA again looked at it and wanted to see what it could do. Passed it up. Um, and a guy by the name of Alexander Sheldon. All right. Yes, He's a Dow chemist. And in 1978 at the age of 74 he published a study on the euphoric effects of MDM. It was the first time anyone had ever published a study that year 1978. Wow. But he was 74 he first noticed the euphoric effects because he liked to take it and go to cocktail parties. Of course he did. Yeah. Um, so he's like, Hey, man, this stuff is the bomb. And here's my study on it here. That my findings and let's everybody start taking this So he starts giving it to his friends. Um, including some psychiatrists. Did he give up pacifiers? Not yet. Okay, that's coming, though. That's a very, very close. 1978 pacifiers came about 1988. Okay, um, so Sheldon gives some to a friend who's a psychiatrist, psychiatrist. Some of the more avant garde psychiatrist, um, start giving it to their patients. And it gets called Adam for a little while while this is going on being used by established psychiatrist. A mysterious financier in Dallas, Texas, finds out about this stuff and starts taking It. Hires an underground chemist and has it made himself and then start selling it at clubs all over Dallas. And so this this illicit use of this substance, simultaneous to its emergence on the club scene in about the mid eighties, led to the outlaw of India. May we'll get into it more. But the point is to this very long and rambling in trim. Both of these drugs and others were legal at one time. Yessir were put to good use, beneficial use and then outlawed, possibly unfairly. And then now we're starting to see them come back into use hallucinogens being used to treat mental illness and mental harm in legitimate circles. Very legitimate. Quick question was that Dallas person was at Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. I don't know. I don't think anybody knows everything. Still got its start. Maybe. Yeah, I think you don't don't it to begin with. So, Josh, you mentioned C I A. I do want to point out it wasn't just the Americans. The Canadian government and British is British. Is it works. Britain's M I six also experimented with LSD, and between 1950 65 40,000 people all over the world had been treated with LSD. Yeah. And treatments. Yeah. Um, Cary Grant? Yeah. Can we go back to Hollywood? Yeah, in the 19. Ah. What year is this? 19 fifties, huh? So a couple of guys set up shop. Arthur Chandler. What was the other guy's name? Oh, hey, Hartman. Hartman. Mortimer Hartmann, who was a radiologist, took Acid Hartman and said, You know, I'm gonna get the psychiatry. These guys set up a shop called the Ah Psychiatric Institute of Beverly Hills right in the middle of Beverly Hills. And this is back in the day when things were clean living going on. Aside from that, rampant alcoholism and cigarettes being smoked. Yeah, adultery probably eats a marijuana use going on here, there. But that was among the hop heads. Yeah, exactly. So he sets up a couple of rooms with a couch in ah, starts booking patients a rate of, like six or eight hours a session. Yeah, depending on what was going on with the person and five days a week, there were booked solid 100 bucks. A pop 100 which is a lot of money back then. Sure. I guess that included the drugs, the drugs, and the time that you were there, right? Yeah. So they would sit with you. They will give you some blinders to block out distractions. And then you would go into sort of like the more meditative sort of acid trip. Essentially, you were trip trip in hard That would cause you were on pharmaceutical grade LSD produced by the Sandoz company. Yeah, we're talking about Alice Huxley. Uh, novelist? Yeah. And actually, he died tripping. Did you know that? Really? Yeah, he was. He had throat cancer, I think. And the last thing he ever wrote was a note to his wife requesting, um, such and such milligrams of LSD or micrograms of LSD injected intra muscular, intra muscular Lee. Really? And that was about six hours before he died. So he died tripping and grateful Dead record. That was his last request before the Grateful Dead around. Shocking. Ah, Screenwriter screenwriter Charles Brackett took it. Director Sid Leela met. Is it lemaitre lament? I limit, I think. Ok, well, we said we may, but I think I'm wrong. He took it a few times, went through sessions, called it wonderful. He re experienced his own birth, which apparently people did. I'd never heard of that. I haven't even And, um uh, Clare Booth Luce was a playwright married to Time magazine publisher Henry Luce. She was also an ambassador and possibly an agent. Um, for the U. S. Government. And they both took acid so much that Henry Luce and Time magazine said we need to write about this. This is awesome. Yeah, there's a lot of good press that Time magazine gave LSD in the fifties, um, as, ah, basically a cure all, Um, and again, Cary Grant got into a big time. Apparently, he had, like, at least 100 trips, I believe. Yeah, he was. Yeah. Let's talk about him for a second. Because he was one of these guys that carefully constructed his persona. He worked very hard. Apparently, he was the The line he always gave was ah, lot of people want to be Cary Grant. And I'm one of them. Yeah, indicating that this suave Mr Cool persona was completely fabricating, created by himself so he could get, you know, the fame and everything. But deep down, he suffered as a human, huh? Until he started taking acid, right? And then he had Well, he had some pretty interesting revelations. One of which I read one of that. Somebody thought to write down the stuff that he some of the insights he had, um, somewhere kind of deep. Others were like, If I have to look at a man, he should be required to comb his hair and brush his teeth. And we're clean shirt. That was an acid revelation. Yes, it was interesting. So it kind of ran the gamut, but yeah, he, um he became a real Dave. Oh Tae of LSD. He was ex wife, too. Yeah, Betsy. And, um Well, she got him into all right? I think so. Who wrote that were part of this? We're basing this part on a Vanity Fair article. That really good article. Yeah. Um, it's called that carrying the sky with diamonds. Yeah, but hey was a huge advocate for LSD. He wasn't the only one. Um, but he lived to see it outlawed in public sentiment turned against it, right? Yes, just like India may, um, Tillis. I've been magic mushrooms and part of the well, really one of the you could say that Timothy Leary almost single handedly led to the tremendous suffering of a lot of people who might otherwise have been helped by LSD. Ron, with his naive bravado. Yeah, of, you know, the establishment just needs to get over its hang ups, and we should all take acid. Yeah, whether or not you agree that that's a good idea, it's a stupid thing to say. Sure, Leary was originally a Harvard psychiatrist, right? Yes, and he started taking, I think, Mushrooms. And then he eventually started taking LSD and was fired from Harvard because it turned into a hippie. And, um, that was pretty much the beginning of the end of LSD. Yeah, they may have continued to use LSD as treatment for mental patient's mental illness and depression. If not for Timothy Leary, who was trying to spread the word about acid. That's right, uh, back to Cary Grant real quick. He was so into it, Josh. He ah had a couple of stories written about him in 1959 in Look magazine. Yeah, the curious story behind the new Cary Grant gave a glowing account of LSD, and then this is the best. The following year, the Good Housekeeping magazine. It got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval in the 1960 issue, and they called it the secret of Grant. Second youth. I want to get a copy of that magazine. Yeah. How awesome would that be? Yeah, and that's kind of like the theme of this podcast is so weird that these things were considered incredibly wonderful and benign. Um, and now they're just viewed us. Just so they're evil in their outlawed simply because they were made illegal, right? Prohibited. Right. Um, And again, there's kind of a movement toward saying, Hey, you know, maybe Timothy Leary did give this a bad name. Maybe that that, um, underground chemist in Dallas really kind of put a terrible spray on this. And we should look at these again, right? She can't tell one more story. Yes, from Hollywood in the 19 sixties. Yeah. Esther Williams, famous diva actress from the MGM studio for enough Cary Grants called Cary Grant up after these articles and said, Hey, can you introduce me to your doctor? Dr Hartman? He did so at the time. She was aging. Just had gone through a divorce. Ah, her husband left her with huge debt with the I. R. S and she was still struggling with the death of her 16 year old brother. She goes in the office. She takes acid that's recession, goes home to her parents, still on acid. Ah, has dinner with them and then goes into the bathroom mirror. Says good night to her parents. Looks in the mirror, and I'm gonna read this quote. I was startled by a split image. 1/2 of my face. The right half was me. The other half was the face of a 16 year old boy. The left side of my upper body was flat, a muscular. I reached up with my boys hand to touch my right breast and felt my Penis stirring. It was a hermaphroditic phantasm, and I understood perfectly in that moment. When my brother died, I took him into my life so completely he became part of me. Yeah, that's a pretty huge thing to understand. Yeah, pretty jarring. Wait. It come to terms with that, right? Yeah, but that's what they're finding out now, though, is that these people are having these breakthroughs in the throes of their final days of let's say, cancer. And they have these epiphanies, you know, check out. Some people are like, Oh, the holidays come earlier and earlier every year, like it's some sort of problem. Yeah, well, I would tell those people, chuck, that they need to try Make Cafe's new seasonal treats because they're going to get them in the holiday spirit. Right quick. That's right, man. We're talking warm, flaky donut sticks made fresh every morning sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. They are back, everybody. And now a new chocolate dipping sauce comes along with it. Delicious. Yeah, plus, let's just talk about the new cinnamon cookie lot. That's right. It's made with cinnamon sugar syrup, hand stirred with milk and rich, freshly brewed espresso man. And then it's topped off with a Sprinkle of cinnamon. Yeah, it tastes like the holidays, and it's gonna put you in the holiday spirit. Warm up to the holidays with donuts sticks, now a chocolate sauce, and the new cinnamon cookie lot on Lee from McCafe Good is brewing for a limited time only at participating McDonald's. So L s D is outlawed. We're following a timeline here. Yes, LSD is outlawed in, I think 65. Something like that, um, at the very at the latest 1970? Yeah. They shut down the shop in Beverly Hills. Yeah, and Sandoz stopped making it. And you ain't got it was outlawed and pushed underground. Yeah, MDM may made it until 1985. And MGM story is linked very closely to a guy named Dr George A Quart A Ah. Who is Johns Hopkins researcher. This floored me. So in 1985 about the time the d a. Is reeling from being caught totally unaware by the crack epidemic. Yeah. Ah, and basically, a lot of people think looking for a whipping post. Sure. Um, they start considering outlawing MGM made at that moment. This guy, Dr Jorja Quarter, um, publishes a study that he says this drug deplete your serotonin levels permanently. Yeah, causing brain damage. Right. It can kill you. Yeah, well, that didn't think it was that later. Yeah. Okay, So this guy who is unknown at the time publishes this study starts to get National Institute of Drug Abuse funding. So basically, this is his job. He starts a career, um, creating scientific evidence. Yeah. In favor of banning drugs leads to the outlaw of M D M. A. Right? Yes. That wasn't quite enough. They scheduled it. The the Feds went after MGM a even harder. And in 2002 they came up with this thing called the Rave Act. That's okay. It's, um what is rave stand for? Reducing Americans vulnerability to ecstasy. I wonder how long they sat around looking at the word rave, saying we gotta make it fit. Yeah, I don't think it fit. Yeah. So, um, the rave act basically said, if you are a club owner and somebody gets caught taking ecstasy or has ecstasy at your club, we're going to shut down your club. It was a huge, huge law, and it was bolstered by another. Um, another study by Dr George Record, eh? Um, that found that he tested on 10 monkeys. Yeah. This is the big one. He injected them with m d M a. Um, a bunch of them went psychotic. Some of them showed early signs of Parkinson's all of a sudden, and two of them died almost immediately after being injected. Yeah, So people started asking questions about this. Like what? What are you talking about? People have been taking this drug forever, and this has never happened right. So they started kind of going after recording, and, um, they found out that he had actually injected him with methamphetamine. Right now, the first thing that tipped them off was he injected him because people were like, Well, you don't inject ecstasy. So that's kind of a weird way to do it right. And then they found out it was methamphetamines, which he blamed on a miss labeling of a drug shipment, which they traced back. And they went No label right here. Yeah. The drug providers, like don't pull a muscle power. Pretty clear. So this is by this time, the rave act is already pastor, and the rave act didn't get past, but something that included that, right, um, was passed by that time. The study that record a produced was pretty was published in science. The journal Science Like that. Z eyebrows. You get as far as scientific journals. Right? Um and finally he gets beaten up enough that he he prints a full retraction. They came clean. The science runs this retraction, saying the hopes, the whole study, Then I produced right. Just forget it ever existed. That that doesn't happen much. No, it doesn't that's very unusual. Required a I get The impression is kind of this. Um well, I just kind of seems like the scientific community views him largely as a shill for the government. So, yeah, um, there's a couple of articles that he shows up in on reason in reason Magazines were checking out. Yeah, and you know, the other interesting thing about that whole story about the big fake study he did with meth, methamphetamines as ecstasy Is that the Parkinson's foundation? The people Parkinson's researcher said. I don't think that that's true. That doesn't make much sense to us, either, that they would show signs of Parkinson's, right? So they looked into it. People went about reproducing a study, Yeah. Um, and the people who run the Parkinson's Foundation actually issued a statement saying, Ecstasy does not do this. Yeah, so they basically came out in favor of ecstasy. It's kind of neat to watch from the outside because there's this guy who's again. I kind of viewed as a show for the government whose beating up on this drug that a lot of people who are also in the scientific community feel is being unfairly outlawed. sure, And so there's kind of beating up on him and retaliation, right? It's kind of neat to see eggheads beat up on one another. You nerd fights, huh? In the end, I d. It went so far that the n I D a. Just kind of quietly pulled their fact sheet on ecstasy is like, um, let's just take this down off the website after the retraction. Yeah, 2003. We'll rewrite it. I'm sure it's back up now. Sure as something else. Yeah, but it doesn't include immediate death and Parkinson's disease, I would imagine. That's right. So Timothy Leary dies. He gets shot into space. He's out of the picture entirely. Everybody gets sick of hippies generally. Yeah. Um, Georgia record days that basically the guy who single handedly getting ecstasy outlawed his work comes into great, great question. And people start going back and looking at MGM again, and they start looking at LSD again. And that's where we find herself right now. Yeah, slowly. But surely people are starting to run studies on whether or not you can use thes hallucinogens to treat mental illness. And the results are pretty astounding, actually. Yeah, and you know where they're leading the charge in Switzerland? Uh, in Los Angeles? Yeah. All these years later. Same place, Yes. Hippie freaks. Yeah. So yeah, Josh, they are. Ah, I think in Switzerland, in Solothurn, Switzerland. They have been experimenting with LSD. Um, psilocybin, which you might know is magic mushrooms. Yes. Ketamine. You might know a special K. That kind of surprised me that that was in there. Yeah. I hadn't heard much about that one either. And they're getting these, uh, these studies published in, Ah, nature reviews neuroscience and other. You know, leading industry peer reviewed publications. Yeah, it's not all under the table. Backroom experiments. Oh, no. These air very heavily overseen. You have to be a very legitimate researcher to get government approval. They're not funded. That's still there. State say they're still having a hard time with funding, and they're just sort of looking to get some restrictions loosened. They're not saying make all this stuff legal, right? They're not battling a legalization on the legalization front at all. No, But what? There was the reason why so many people are kind of starting to put their reputations on the line. Um, is because the results that they're seeing So we have antidepressants, right? Yeah. Um, they take weeks to kick in. Sure, they have all sorts of side effects. Are. And what? They're what we're seeing in the studies now, are that the things like ketamine? M d m a L s d are having, like, a huge impact right out of the gate, right? There's one study, um, that came out in July, I believe. Um, and it found it was a study of 12 people who were diagnosed with PTSD. Post traumatic stress disorder. Yeah, that's one of the big ones. Yeah, that's huge. They're looking at, um, that's where you will. It's what we used to call shell shock. If you go through a traumatic experience and you relive it over and over again, um, and it's it's debilitating. Um, they found that of the 12 people in this study, 10 of them, after going through the study, um, after taking M d m. A no longer met the criteria to be diagnosed with PTSD Afterward. 10 of the 12 Yeah, and for my understanding, and most of these studies is it's not like you have to stay on ecstasy your whole life. Like a lot of people have these epiphanies, and they quit taking it, and they have changed their outlook and that, right? Yeah. That's the impression I'm getting to. Um, ketamine apparently is good for depression in the same way. Um, just a very tiny dose. I can get you over severe clinical depression, or that's the results of the early results we should say. Yeah, um, and everything from quitting smoking, two suicidal thoughts, cluster headaches. Yeah, Harvard is studying this. Those air migraines for men, right? Uh, what, they called my visit? Migraines? I think so. I know they're so debilitating that you consider suicide. You know, not everyone does, obviously, but sure, it's just this awful, awful pain You can't leave your house. You get to sit in a dark room. And so it's helping there. And, um what I thought was interesting. Johns Hopkins. You might have heard of them. Sure. Little reputable institutions are required. Is from Was it? Uh, they did an experiment where they gave psilocybin to emotionally stable individuals like this wasn't even people who are mentally ill people that had never taken hallucinogens before, which is interesting that you would be. I think they had a 64 year old that signed up for this. Yeah, it's crazy. And they said, Ah, ages 2040 64 they said the experiment a year later. They said the experience is one of the most meaningful and spiritual experiences of their entire lives. Yeah, and that those were mentally stable folks. Sure. And this is a year on, right? It's still had an impact on him. Um, they're also finding that ah o C d. And basically, mood disorders are the primary target of hallucinogenic treatment, right? Psychedelics for treatment. And the reason being, we think, is because they target serotonin in the brain. This is another reason why they're not addictive. They don't. They don't employ the reward circuit in the brain, right? Which is how we become addicted to things were flooded with dopamine member. It just affects the mood circuits in the right serotonin. And we don't really have a very good grasp on serotonin and exactly how that works. But we do know that, um, there's correlations between ah, high levels of serotonin or low levels of serotonin and depression. Right? Right. And we know that, um, using anti depressants which block the re uptake of serotonin, um, reduces symptoms of clinical depression and people. So we know that serotonin is in there somewhere. We know that the more serotonin you have, the better generally or low serotonin bad, right? Right. Ah, and then we also know that hallucinogens target this somehow. That's pretty much where the research stands right now, it makes you wonder where would we be if l S D and M d M A hadn't been in the wilderness for the last few decades? Well, yeah, They may have a pill like a low dose pill, because a lot of these studies just so you know, back in Cary Grant states that mean if this full, full on acid trips But a lot of these, like the solo Simon pills, they'll give you be very low dose. So I don't get the feeling that it's not like this huge mushroom trip that a lot of these patients are going through because it said think 80% of the people recognized when they did not have the placebo. So if it was 100% then it was probably a pretty low dose. Yes. Would be my guess. Um, would you if if everything was legalized, um, and MGM a came to be prescribed for just happiness, right? Would you take it? Would you take a happy pill that was legal and didn't have side effects? Not to say M d M A doesn't have side effects. There's a like, basically the three days after. Sure, A depression that follows when your serotonin levels air re pleading themselves. I don't think I would, because there are quote unquote happy pills now, huh? And, I mean, it's not like I'm against any depressants or things like that, cause people definitely benefit from those who need them. But I just I don't need that kind of thing, So I would not, uh, I would not serve. You are not alone, Chuck. There is a survey conducted for this BBC series on Britain of British people that found that 79% of them said that they would not take a happy pill, right. It was legal and had no side effects. That's interesting. Yeah, because it kind of I think that for a large segment of the population, that is this the idea of synthesizing happiness is unt toward? Yeah, you know. Yeah, it's this weird. Yeah. I mean, that's not the same a square. And I don't like to get down. Uh, another aspect, Josh. I mean, we're talking right now about literally the effect it has on your brain in your serotonin levels and your moods. They've also found that patients cancer patients in particular who consume hallucinogens, uh, or people with just, um, traumatic events from earlier in their life. They have the ability to relive some of these memories and events from their past, can unlock buried traumatic episodes, deal with them psychologically, put them to rest, and come out the other side with a new understanding free from these demons. Right. Um, you remember in the hypnosis episode where we were talking about how the way it's viewed now is that you are You're accessing the subconscious easy. Yeah, more easily. Like popping open a control panel. That's what This is this what they're seeing with m d. M. A. Apparently, uh, you are able to access things, um, from a very empathetic way. I think the term I've heard for it is called, um, a psychotherapeutic catalyst. Yeah, I think it's a chick starts right things. And I think one researcher called it. It's psychotherapy. Sped up. Psychiatrist called that, Yeah, it's like psychotherapy on acid. Hey, friends, we want to talk to you about the future of phone service because it is here, and it's called visible.

And what's funny in this article that it's on the site? Can we treat mental illness with hallucinogens? Tom Chief, Your body has to go to Thesixties psychedelic rock scene. Find examples of people who have had a bad, bad time on acid. Uh Ah. And apparently what the conventional wisdom is if you are predisposed to mental illness, LSD can exacerbate that. Yeah, if you have a bad trip, you're going to have a really, really bad trip because you're already predisposed mental illness. Yeah, he's Brian Wilson and Syd Barrett as the two examples. Yeah, and those were stellar examples. They really have got to say, but they're also counterintuitive to what we're seeing with, um, like PTSD. You are already suffering from a mental illness. So here's some MDM a right. Probably LSD would be horrible to give to a PTSD survivor. Yeah, right. I would say so. Um And what else Chuck, can we talk about Pamela Secura? Sure. Yeah, Very interesting story. This is a woman age 57 at the time of this article who was in the final stages of colon cancer. She had outlived her prognosis. She was anxious and depressed. She was worried about her family, her husband and what they were going to do without her. It was not a good life. She was living here at the end and she was prescribed antidepressants. Of course. Didn't work. Didn't do a thing for so she volunteered for an experiment at U. C. L. A. In 2005 and started taking psilocybin, the magic mushroom pill in pill form. She ah had a lot of breakthroughs. Ah, they brought her husband in at the end of one of the sessions and he said, There's my Pammy. She was just beaming with light, and I haven't seen her that joyous and so long. She was totally alive and happy, and she continued to take it until she didn't need it anymore. She had these breakthroughs, and then all of a sudden, her husband and ah, Pamela, we're going to concerts. They went hiking at the Grand Canyon. They went on vacations. They did all these things that she hadn't been doing in a long time. Because of these epiphany she had under the influence of psilocybin. And sadly, she died. Well, she had cancer. Yeah, she died. Yeah, that's what she died from in 2006. And her husband said, uh, she died in his arms, but her husband was very appreciative, and they actually did a benefit about a week before she died for the institute that was doing this work at U C l A. So it's pretty interesting. Yeah. The definitely one of the applications that they're finding is end of life. Care for, um, using M d m. A or LSD. You're still a sideman? Sure. Or special? K, apparently. What about this ibogaine? They're finding that ibogaine works really well. Ibogaine is a, um it's from, ah, hallucinatory root plant in Africa. I believe, um, and they're finding that you go on a 36 hour trip. That's a long time it this whole time, but they're finding that it's really effective in breaking addiction and, like serious addictions to like heroin. Yeah, cocaine. So being on this stuff just for 36 hours creates a break in the addiction cycle itself. Sure, but what they're finding this most notable about it is it. There's a lack of withdrawal symptoms that you see in every other type of raising addiction. Removal? Yeah, um, especially with heroin like heroin. You're supposed to have physical withdraw, sent withdrawal symptoms. And people who are taking ibogaine are not experiencing that like they would if they tried to kick the habit without it. It's pretty remarkable. Yeah, it is very remarkable is very interesting. We should probably say, I don't know if we have yet that this podcast is in no way an endorsement of going out and buying yourself some street drugs and, you know, seeing what happened. This is study of what we find to be very fascinating. The fact that this is there's been a resurgence in this and these, you know, qualified doctors. U C L A. Johns Hopkins, after saying we should look into this stuff. Yeah, and they definitely are. And they're getting some very interesting results. What about the A? A guy We should mention that really quickly. That was pretty funny. Oh, yeah. Bill Wilson. Yet one of the co founders of a A Yeah, he, uh he apparently took LSD in the fifties. Was it you? And this is after he was long after he was sober from alcohol. Yeah. Can I found it is the thirties, I think. Oh, had it. Yeah. Um, so he takes LSD in the fifties, and it's like, this is really helpful. Um, so I think everybody who comes into a take LSD on they were like, No, you should probably not do that. They talked him out of it. But the reason why he found it helpful is that hallucinogens part of a 12 step program is too really reflect on past wrongdoings. Yeah, and then a lucid ate them right to another human being and apparently LSD m the m es. These other drugs help they serve as a catalyst for that process. So tap into that. That's why Bill Wilson, I thought, this is This is really helpful, because again, it's like a therapy sped up very fast. I will say this. So I'm gonna go out on a limb and say, even though we're not saying, Oh, you should go out and do these things, I will say that some chemically created in a lab pill called an anti depressant, isn't it? I mean, what's the difference? The difference is, I think, in my opinion, from what I've seen, Ah ah, one's marketed and legal and the other is illegal. Too simple is that one is made by Mark, and one is not Babe my Mark. But it Mark used to make this right, which is ironic. Public sentiment counts for everything. Yeah, you know, it's the same reason the alcohol You can go into a bar and get completely wasted out of your mind and get in the car. But you can't walk into a bar and smoke a joint or shoot heroin or shoot heroin, and we're not lobbying for anything. It's just interesting that the things that society has deemed acceptable alcoholism is just fine. Well, it's not just fine, but it's it's legal, and you can do it right, even though it kills all these people and this is not acceptable. It's just it's funny how we've evolved to think some things are evil and some things are just great. Yeah, I wonder what the future holds, Josh, I wonder myself. We'll find out. Yes, we will. We live that long? That is about it. For this one, you should probably check out. Can we treat mental illness with hallucinogens on the site? Be sure to check out Carry in the sky with diamonds. Right. Vanity Fair article typing. George Rick orte R i c u a r t e in the reasons website that'll bring up some cool stuff. There's a killer Time magazine article from, I think, 2000 or 2001 um, on Ecstasy on M d m A. It was It's really it's called the, uh, happiness and a pill. I guess it's time now for our listener male, right? Yes, I have a listener male Josh from Rhea. And this was about octopus or occupy wear corrected. That occupies not right. But she says it. She worked a pie is so right. Well, we have these people saying, actually, the Latin thing a little moment train just left it at that. Hi, guys. Your podcast on Occupy made my day today. Thank you. I work as an Aquarius at a San Francisco aquarium and one of my favorite responsibilities is his are cephalopod gallery. I get to do enrichment with giant Pacific octopus odds, make sure all of our eight legged friends stay out of trouble. And I'm currently teaching ah, to spot octopus how to open a jar to get his favorite food, which is live crabs. I'm right there with you, Mr Octopus. Uh, it was great to hear someone besides myself get a little too excited about these critters. And, you know, we got great feedback on this. People love the Octopus because you're so freaky. The story about Luke racial MK evil especially cracked me up. I work with the GPO. That's the giant Pacific Octopus that might give her a run for her money. For the past few weeks, I've been walking around with what my colleagues call Octopus kisses up the length of my arms. But I'm afraid my husband is getting a little suspicious about the number of Vicky's I've been acquiring. So that's from the little suckers. Suckers, clearly thes were given to me while I tried to remove the individual from blocking the flow to his tank and stopped his flooding of the entire aquarium. It's never boring day with cephalopods in your life, guys. Thanks for all the great podcast. If you're ever in San Francisco. One of my favorite places, Josh. Yeah, let me know, and I'll see if I can't work out some behind the scenes cephalopod. Goodness Nice. And that is from Rhea. And she says, And don't worry. By the way, I have trouble pronouncing Heck Toto Catellus as well, and have taken to calling in the sperm tentacle. Sperm tentacle works sperm ical. That's what she says, she says. It's time to rename that organ. Yes, well, thanks, Ria, right? Yes, thank you. My dad always said life is better with cephalopods in it. Really? If you have Ah, fantastic saying that your father, mother, grandfather, some old timing person told you we want to hear it, wrap it up in an email, spank it on the bottom and then send it to stuff.

You can't top that was trying to think a way to say welcome to the podcast and cocky rhyming slang. Can you make it? My My brain is so broken right now. I can't even try. OK, Good, Good. Well, welcome. It's a good good time to record the show. Exactly. You're gonna do some cock me in here, right? We want to offend as many Londoners as we can. I don't know. Just just channel Little Dick Van Dyke. Um, you know? Yeah. The American doing a bag cock maniacs. Well, I did recently re watch The Limey. Yes, for Casey's benefit and the great great movie from Steven Soderbergh. Never seen. It's awesome. Is it really? Yeah. I mean, I know it's like a classic, and everybody loves it, but, I mean, it's really that good, huh? Yeah, because a lot of people like, um, one of the hangover. I, like thing over. Well, how would you How would you like the Limey and the hangover? Same level. Yeah. They're the same movie. Almost. All right. It's weird. Well, that I've seen the hangover, so don't even like me. Now. The lemons great in Terence Stamp is awesome. And it and uses some cocky rhyming slang and one great scene. My big exposure to cock me rhyming slang is block stock in two smoking barrels match, which I think you're both directed by Guy Ritchie right? Wasn't lock stock like his first attempt in snatch was the one that, like, got him married to Madonna. You a fan of his? Yeah. I mean, as much as I like his movies, I don't like him personally necessarily, cause he, like hunt boar like a jackass. Doesn't like, Yeah, no drunk with his friends in the most like, disrespectful way of murdering a pig. I admit his movies, but yeah, I do like his movie. Sounds like he's a creep, too. I'm not gonna go on record saying that, but ah, yeah, those movies were okay. And then I guess, ah, what's his name? Don Cheadle. A little bit in Ocean's 11. Sure, he did a little bit of that, right? And I mean, like, it's code to Americans. It's Oh, there's like a criminal. A British criminal, right? That's all it means. The's days. Yeah, I think so. In movies, it's definitely like all of those were criminal right criminal people in the middle there, like, you know, kind of slick, cool criminals that like a leather coats and stuff like that, not not dumb criminals that were like football jerseys or anything like that. They're like, you know, smooth criminals. That's I think what I was looking for. Yeah, but, um, this this idea of associating it with cock me is not necessarily associating with criminals. It's more associated with, like, um, lower class, working class, less educated. Definitely not the aristocracy over in Britain. Yeah. Or the upper class? Sure. And that by by speaking with a cock knee accent, or more to the point, using cock knee rhyming slang you could really differentiate yourself to as a point of pride, right? Like you were speaking like your group, You're in group, which was at the time Cock me. Right. But the big surprise to all of this is it's really possible and even probable that it wasn't the cock me that came up with this rhyming slang that it was somebody else. Altogether. Maybe. Who knows? Shall we say what it is? No, not for the rest of the podcast cock. Any rhyming slang? It wasn't even very clearly defined in this piece. Okay, Did you get what it's in there? Okay, you got to just kind of separate the wheat from the chaff. So it is a two word phrase. It is a slang phrase consisting of two words. So far, so were the last word of that phrase rhymes with the original word, and it can be. And I think the best way to do this is just to throw out of, you know, keep describe. Well, the two were trays. That can be. It could be a lot of things that can be a person's name. It could be just something random could be a place could be a place. It could be a lot of things. It could be anything. Yeah, sure, I guess it can't be. But shall we illustrated through? Well, there's a second part to it to okay, the second part. And this is very important. The two word phrase that you're using to that where the 2nd 1 rhymes with the word you're actually saying, Yeah, the original word. The original word Thank you usually has nothing to do with it. There's no metaphor. There's no connection. There's no nothing. There's no there's no context to it. It's supposed to just be random. Er, in most cases, it is just random words, right, one of which rhymes with the word you're replacing and to further complicate things. Sure, in a lot of cases, and no one knows why. Sometimes this happens, and sometimes it doesn't a lot of times that one of the words of the two word phrases dropped, you know, And then you're just left with one word, which doesn't even rhyme with the original word anymore, right? That's I mean, that's probably the best description of cocky rhyming slang anyone's ever given, so I think we should illustrate it with a couple of examples. I pulled some from, ah, from something called the Internet. Um, here. Here's one the, uh, the tip in Tet. That's how long it took me to come up with that tip in debt for Internet. But in 10 years, it'll just be called the tip. Gonna log onto the tip, governor. So let's say your word was and this was in Ocean's 11. Specifically, trouble is the word that you're trying to say. Cock knee rhyming slang for trouble Is Barney rubble awesome? Um, and so you would say you're making a bit of the Barney rubble again, right? When somebody that was kind of, um who was that making a bit of Bonnie rebel, Not the Sea already did it wrong? No, but I think that sounds like a real person to an American, for sure. Oh, yeah. Um, I can't I can't kill all. Shout it out later, man. May I finally did a good one. I just I just don't know. But it wasn't a cocky person, is it? Okay. Another example. Um, for queen, um, they would use the term baked bean. Look who's on TV. It's the baked bean, right? And that's the queen like that. Or in the case of one that's been dropped. Ah, what is Ed used here? Bees and honey, That one is not dropped for money. Okay, but which one was Apple's Impairs cares, right? So you would say, Ah, I'm going to go up the apple and stares apples and pears. Oh, man. I mean, retake this, Everybody. You may say I'm going to go up the apples and pears, get my wallet to pay for this pizza. Something to that effect. Okay, But then over time, people drop the pears. And so now the word for stairs and cocky rhyming slang is just apples, which, if you just standing there on the outside like a normal American bloke shirt, by the way, means person. Um, you have no idea why this person just called stairs apples. You got what they were saying because the context is there. You're going up the apples to get your wallet to pay for the pizza. But why would you just say that? Did you did you hit your head? Is there something wrong with you? What's the problem? Why would you just call that apples? That's why it's so confounding. But the great thing about cocky rhyming slang and in particular, the great thing about researching cocky rhyming slang because you learn how you get from apples to stairs and then it makes sense sometimes, yeah, it's true. It's not always. Sometimes there's, ah, it's not documented. Which, Ed points out, is one of the problems. Sometimes you can draw the line the through line, but because it's not documented, and sometimes thes things take years and years to morph into its final version, right, Unless you unless you're, you know, on the ah, what would you call Street on the dole now on the streets? Then I wouldn't know, but I don't know what Street says. You can't just make stuff up like there's real words on the drums and beats on the drums, right? But they probably have a word for streets like That's the whole point. You can't just make anything up, but you could if it hasn't been taken yet. Sure, but also, that's the other thing about cocky rhyming slang is it evolves, right? So old celebrities that that no one even knows about a more follow way to new celebrities whose name also rhyme with, you know, whatever word you're right. I thought you meant old celebrities who may be used to talk this way. Like Michael Caine. No, he's never said any rhyming slang in his life. Of course, you've got to see the movie, Alfie. Maybe that's who it was. It might have been Michael King. I don't think that Mike Okay, I think it was as America. Yep. Thank you. I'm glad you did know Low, he says. A good joke is to say, Michael Caine and the correct accent say the words my cocaine and it sounds like Michael Caine saying it. Then it sounds like that. The correct accent for Michael Caine, right? My cocaine. Well, you just blew that one, huh? You're gonna set me up in the future is now You have a record of everything. My cocaine. Well, there's I've got it two ways now, man. Okay, here's the thing. My cocaine, That's my cocaine. It's pretty good. Michael Caine did get your right. No, you just got to say it the right way and not like a robot. Josh. So, uh, here's that one of the things that sort of confounding if you want to look up a ah like a glossary and say, Well, here's I'm gonna do I'm gonna learn cocky rhyming slang. So for my trip to England, I'm really you know, I'm really in with everybody. Percival Bad idea. Ah, second of all, it's It could be very localized. And the accents are all different. Yes. So even people in London sure who Both who all use well people in London don't really do. But people who use cocky rhyming slang in London might not even agree on what word is means what? I'm just picturing all the people walking around England laughing their arses off. I can't wait to get to that one. Disagree. As we stumble through this Um, yeah. It had a really good example of why there's no, um, codification of the cocky rhyming slang. He said that when people are creating a language, especially informal ones like slang, they don't write it all down. Quote Dear Diary referred to my house is a cat and mouse today because it rhymed we all had a good laugh. Might try just calling it cat tomorrow and see how it goes. It sounds funny, but that's that's how it works. Cumin stumbling across the dyers. Um, and here's the other thing, too, is there are cases where there is a little bit of a reflection of the original word, and the example that it gives here is twist. Yeah, I like to call a woman a twist, which I don't know if that's a derogatory or not, or just some weird slang that no one uses anymore. I don't think so, although I don't know so thes. They're also the people who use the C word like it's nothing you can't bring yourself to say, Fanny. Oh, man, I can't wait to go back there. What we're gonna do soon this right? I'd love to do in 2020 maybe. Yeah. All right. Eso twist came from twist and twirl, which meant girl, which is they were talking about, like dancing with a girl, twisting and twirling in a nightclub. Okay, so there is some connection in that one. Yeah. So girl ended up becoming twist, so that sort of makes sense. There's another one called on your tod after a guy named Todd Sloan. And it means on your own, right. And the thing is, is like on your tod, It makes sense. Sloan rhymes with bone. It doesn't have to have any connection, but that one actually does. Because Todd Sloan was a famous jockey in the 19th century course. Chucky. Yes. Okay. What other kind is there? Disc jockeys. Oh, yeah, sure. Um, So his book, his memory is called Todd Sloan by himself, which is weird to refer to yourself in third person for your memoir. But there was a line in it that apparently, East end EastEnders in London, like, really picked up. I was left alone by those I never ceased to grieve for. So, like, the idea of being a loner on your own became synonymous with Todd Sloan. These things just happen to rhyme with that. So it's one of those rare ones where there is a connection to it and also rare Chuck in that this is 1/19 century horse jockey, and still today on your Tod is recognized is on your own, whereas a lot of people probably have no idea exactly from who he is. And when that happens that frequently, that person gets moved out for potentially another celebrity. Another word that's a little more understandable. Recognize another new jockey to people today, right? Exactly. Which can you name one? No. Nope. Um, all right, maybe you should take a break and we'll talk about some of the other. Some other examples after this message problems. It's human nature to hate problems. But why is that? After all, problems inspire us to mend things bend things make things better. That's why so many people work with IBM on everything from city traffic, toe ocean, plastic, new schools to new energy flight delays to food safety, smart loves problems. IBM. Let's put smart toe work. Visit IBM dot com slash smart toe learn more. Okay, we're back. Jerry just opened the loudest sandwich in the history of the world really want. She's like, hold on a minute. And it sounded like a kills in that space blanket. It was like Ernest opens a sandwich over here. That was a good one. Not as good as part two. You know, I saw that 1st 1 in the theater. Yeah. Huh. So here's some other examples that, uh, have some of them have sort of stayed over in England, and some of them have found their way, like, apparently, the term put up your dukes. Oh, I didn't know the Hockney rhyming saying so and I didn't write down where Duke's came from, but that's where it was originally. A cocking, rhyming slang term. Yeah, because So, um, you would think it has to do with fists or something. Yeah. Dukes for fists. What? Did not write that down. Okay, but but so that's another really important point to say about cocky rhyming slang. It's frequently rhyming slang based on slang. So the word it's replacing is a slang word to begin with. Who knows what the Duke's actually ride with at any point? Yeah, that's good point. Yeah. So, uh, first of all, I've never heard this blowing a raspberry. What? Have you heard of that? Yeah, that's tooting. That's what I just did. Uh, is as much blowing raspberries actually farting. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm sort of giving someone a raspberry like that. Okay, That's the same thing. Yeah. Okay. Well, apparently, that's derived from raspberry tart slang for fart in that amazing. It's pretty great. Yeah. So that one is one of the rare ones I love talking about exceptions. Do you know that now? Sure. Um, that's one of the rare ones that made its way to America because of right everyone. But you knows what? Blowing arrest? Various. I guess I'd never heard of the term blowing, but giving someone a raspberry. Same thing I found two more. One is controversial. It's not set in stone, but it's as good an explanation as any. Get down to brass tacks. I saw that one too. That's a standing for facts, right down to the bare fact. Uh um, possibly that's not it's not right. Done. Um, one that is 100% as far as I can tell is bread. I saw that, too. For money. Yeah, in America. Bread and honey became just bread, right? And it called on here and called on again just now. Well, bees and honey, though, was also for money. Right? Is that just one of the local, like, Depends on where you are things. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, But in America, I mean, you know, we use bread. Everybody calls it bread. Yeah, I didn't know that that had come back. Yeah, somebody wrote in to say it had come back. Let's get this bread. All right. I guess so. That's familiar. You need to spend more time on red. Uh, here's another one. Dog and bone stands in for phone. Call me on the dog and bone. Sure. Ah. And then Ed says there may be some kind of correlation between one syllable words that lead off that phrase, Um, staying in the phrase. But there are some of the exceptions. I don't know if there is a rule. Exactly. And I think that's really this is worth saying. We looked all over the place. I know Ed did, too. For straight up linguistic dissertations and papers on cock knee rhyming slang, right? It's not there. No, it's just treated as fun and hilarious. Even though it is its own made up language that's ever evolving. Still, live has been around. We'll talk about the history of minutes for 150 plus years, but apparently no linguist has ever thought enough of it to to sit down and write a genuine paper about it, right? So we couldn't find that. But the one thing that really occurred to me was in looking into it. E. I don't know if it could ever be explained. I think it's the result of so many individual decisions, Yeah, and then collective agreements to take up and go along with those decisions. And those agreements can be totally undermined by a new individual decision that catches on that. How could you possibly map and even understand all our explain all of that different stuff, But you know that we can't explain it once you start to learn how it works, it's understandable. You can't explain, but you can't understand it. Yeah, and it's like I always wonder, with any kind of slang or Mike who who makes this stuff up who sets the rules? It's probably just the kind of thing that just starts on a playground. Yeah, and spreads from there. Right and gets codified unofficially. Yes. Ah. Then everyone's using it. Sure, but I wonder if they're, you know, I don't know. You can't trace this stuff, which is sort of frustrating his researchers. Right, Because I think we like to pinpoint things. Yeah, but I mean, people have tried to trace it, and they've come awfully close. What? We'll get to that in a minute. I want to go over some more of these. All right, I want to get up on my plates and get out of here. You meet your plates of meat plates of meat, which is feet for between podcast. You probably have to go take a rattle. Yeah. Rattling hiss, rattling hiss like a snake. You got it. And thats means pee pee. Right? And then should I guess we should talk about ours? Yeah, sure. That's the one you were pretty excited about. Yes, because it goes even so much farther than our Steven. Yeah, it's pretty convoluted. Okay, You want to take it now? Go ahead. Okay. So arse. The very famous name for ass in the UK Everybody knows that. Sure, it's actually it comes from Aristotle which you're like. Well, what does that have to do with ass? Well, let me tell you, Aristotle is cocky rhyming slang for bottle again. The question is, what does that have to do with ass, right? Well, originally, the cocky rhyming slang word for ass was bottle and glass, right? Became shortened a bottle. Somebody came along and rhymed Aristotle with it. That guy's shortened the heiress and then the arse crazy goes even further than that. Oh, yeah, I saw one plaster for ours. Plaster of Paris. Oh, look, Aris Aristotle Bottle bottle and glass ass. That's how deep the cocky rhyming slang has covered up the collective ass of the UK. Yeah, And again, it's like, why you can't You can't put that in a book and explain it in any kind of way. That makes sense. You got to do it on a podcast or a paper, right? You just have to accept it. It's like that's how it happened on the street. I think that's a really good way on the streets of the east end, Right? Right. On your cocaine. No, not York. Okay. Uh, they do have for all that were saying about how don't look at glossaries and stuff like that. They do have dictionaries that you can buy. If you're a Total Square e. I would guess it's probably not a cool thing to d'oh. That's like saying, You know, I want to become a rapper So let me get a rhyming dictionary. Although I did have a rhyming dictionary at one point, well, driving, it's not, you know, just limited to cock me. We, of course, loved a rhyme. Yeah, which is one assertion Ed makes for why it's popular so long lasting. Well, should we talk about some of the theories on where it originated? Because I looked in a bunch of places and I don't think I mean, I think calling it theory is a little, um, I think they kind of know where it came from. They just don't know exactly why they can pin pointed toe like on this day on this in this place, right? It is not a complete mystery, though. No, they've got it basically localized to about a one and 1/2 mile area of London and basically down to the year, it's just exactly aware in exactly who's in exactly why are the real outstanding questions, which is actually a lot of questions. Yeah, one of the one of the wise was that Ah, and this one, I think, doesn't have as much credence now. But nobody is like the most common one, right? Is that you will hear that it was coded language created by criminals to keep the cops confused as to what was going on right, which makes sense in one way, because it certainly could cause confusion. But it also, um, and I think it makes a pretty good point that, like, were they like, we're cops just hanging around, overhearing things like, Why did they feel like they needed to create this whole language? And cops, if they were street cops, would have figured this stuff out as well, you know, because it would have been that big of a secret. Yeah, there's this guy named Dick Sullivan who wrote an essay on the Victorian web, which is actually kind of cool. Um, and he said the street cops would have come from the same areas and families and neighborhoods that the criminals would have, so they would have been raised on this rhyming slang anyway. sure, So it doesn't really hold up to scrutiny when you when you look at it like that. It was a intentionally created, coded language meant to confuse the cops right then. That's not to say it nevertheless wasn't associated with some kind of criminal underworld. East London types. Yeah, and it almost certainly was taken up by the cock knees. But it wasn't necessarily cock knees or criminals who came up with this rhyming slang to begin with. There's this guy named John Camden Haden, and he wrote one of the better titled, or at least most directly titled books I've ever heard off. And there's no colon. No, there's no there are a couple of Commons them, a dictionary of modern slang can't and vulgar words used at the present day in the streets of London. And he did it. He has a chapter on rhyming slang, and he basically says that it was two groups Sean, tres and patters, basically traveling salesman who would stand on street corners and hawk their wares and, you know, maybe pick your pocket while you were trying to buy something from them, and that they came up with a cock knee rhyming slang. Yeah, and I saw that enough to think that that's probably true. Yeah, the Sean tres in particular spoken like singing, rhyming language. So it would have been a pretty quick evolution. Yeah, I think this makes a lot of sense. Street criers. I mean, England in London especially, Says has a long tradition of street corner barkers and things like this. Remember seeing one myself when I traveled there in the nineties and I was like, They're still doing this stuff? Yeah, it was like a box in the park where you can go stand on it. And so box, maybe e. That's where that came from, right? Probably. And Ah, and just, you know, shelter piece. Sure, it's all guy doing it. And I thought, What year is this? This is wonderful, right? It's fantastic. But the in particular the Sean Ters they sang and then sold penny ballads, sheet music of penny ballads that they would write real quick after somebody famous diet or there was a train wreck or something. They'd write a ballad about it on, be out on the corner, selling these things because they were singing in rhymes and sing song It's a really good bet that these guys were the ones who originated rhyming slang. But, um, not necessarily for any kind of intentionally coded language, because that same guy, Dick Sullivan, says there's no reason for patters who sold their little geegaws or trinkets or whatever. I love that word, um, or saunters who were selling these penny ballads They worked alone. There was no need for them to come up with the coded language, communicate with one another. Yeah, in front of a customer who they were ripping off. They didn't need to communicate with one another in front of customers. Well, I saw that maybe they, you know, could communicate with each other when customers were around or something. I don't know, right. But the other part of that is that it supposedly flies in the face of house lying, develops that it's unintentional, right? Like you don't say, Let's come up with the coded language. And here's how it works. Yeah, even like American teenagers, when they have slang that their parents don't understand. Like you remember how that stuff went. It was something you just heard. You never sat around. Sure, I'm hip to that. hadn't said, You know, like, Hey, let's use this other word that our parents won't know what it means, right? You know, we'll call it Pepsi were on the phone. There was also the Victorian back slang, which that was not cocking rhyming, something that was just pronouncing words backwards. Ah, sort of simple, like yob for boy. Yes, but something interesting about that is that it's based on the spelling, not the pronunciation right, which is suggests the strong degree of literacy, which you would probably not have found among at least the patters, right? Probably among the Sean Tres because they were writing songs and ballads, right? So it's possible they came up with that, too. But they think maybe it was butchers and butchers. Assistants who came up with back Sling. Really? Yeah, it actually too confused customers. Or to be able to talk about what price they should charge a customer in front of the customer. Right? So there is like you take all these different pieces and you get the current idea and story for cocky rhyming slang, but it's actually a bunch of different stuff. Yeah, that wasn't really all connected until later on Yeah. What? It probably also was not was Irish dockworkers. Yeah, there was one theory being bandied about that Irish dockworkers would come over and they would speak in this made up rhyming slang S o. You know, they could just talk among their Irish peers, and the people of London wouldn't understand them. Not much of this makes any sense at all, because they don't. I think now you see it. Some in Ireland. But, um, for all those years that it was prevalent in London, it was not in Ireland. Right? Unless they literally just made it up when they came over from Ireland. Right? Plus, why would they not to speak Irish in front of the English who might not speak it? Yeah, Or what would that be? Gaelic. Ah, sure, I think so. We're getting so much of this wrong. Do you want to take a break? In fact, check everything and maybe just rewind and start over. Yeah, Let's Let's get our Ah, wait. What was facts are brass tacks. That's right. So we got to go get our brass straight. That's right. Hey, friends, we want to talk to you about the future of phone service because it is here and it's called visible. Yet for 40 bucks a month, all in you get unlimited data messages and minutes on Verizon's four G l T E Network and Visible doesn't do annual contracts. They also don't do shady hidden fees or foot long phone bills, either. When they say 40 bucks a month, they mean 40 bucks a month. Yeah, and when they say, unlimited data, that means unlimited data. They also don't have physical phone stores. That means no waiting in lines or dealing with annoying sales. People with visible you can sign up by a new phone or bring your own device. Get help. That's a tap away via chat, text or tweet and get better phone service all from their app or website without ever leaving your couch. Yep, so are you ready to learn more? Switch to visible than head too visible dot com slash stuff and get $20 off your first month of service. An exclusive special offer just for stuff you should know listeners that's visible dot com slash stuff. Okay, we're back. Spent about 30 minutes since we left you guys. We, um, fact checked everything and so far so good. Yeah, this is a perfect broadcasts. So you said at the beginning you teased out that it might not even have been cock me to begin with. Everything I saw kind of placed it in that the that east. I think they call it Cheapside Really area. Well, um, where the cock knees were, but cock knee was also. I mean, it's also not necessarily specifically one place, right? No, But if you're talking about cock knee people, supposedly the definition of a cocky person is someone who is born within hearing distance of the bells of ST Mary Le Bow. Okay, in Cheapside, Um, which was in London. What? This guy, John Camden Haden, who is writing in 18 60 placed the, um, place the origin of rhyming slang 12 to 15 years before. So this guy was like, on top of it as it was happening. Um, he placed it in a place called Seven Dials, which is like a big market place and I think still is, which is a mile and 1/2 away from Cheapside, which at the time was in Westminster at the time of different town, right, So you had city of London and then Westminster, which is where seven dials was. So if you're if you believe hot and then it wasn't the cock knee at all who came up with that? It was just patters and Sean tours. That's a different word. Then I said, no showing tours. Well, cock knee has, uh What that is, though, is just sort of the working class, I think used to be viewed as uneducated, sort of lower class. Um, that may be a bit harsh, but if anything, it was not the upper crust of British society. You know, the pub, the hard drinking pub goers rub a dub dub goers is that pub's Yeah, which is another exception, because you go from 11 syllable pub to rub a dub dub. And it actually has three rhymes in their interest. Like that is cocky rhyming slang for pub. Well, but the colonies were also known for a bit more of progressive politics, and I think nowadays there can be a bit more of, ah, a pride of like a working class pride associated with it. I think there was back then, too was there, but I think that's one reason also why the cock knee accent and cocky rhyming slang in particular was, um, just treated shabbily and looked down on, you know, by the rest of England, right, Because it was supposedly, you know, associated with lower classes. Yeah, it also found its way to Australia in that right. And then somehow in the west Coast of America, um, where the Australian version came in. Yeah, in the prisons of the West Coast in the US it was called Australian rhyming slang. So I guess some cool guy from Australia showed up and was speaking in gibberish That just made everyone think I want to do this too, right? It's kind of fun to go on YouTube, though, and see some of these, you know, because it's such a big thing in England, it's been all over the BBC. I watched one episode of the two Ronnie's, where this priest at a sermon and Connie rhyming slang. It's very funny and one of those sort of, you know, eighties. I guess it was eighties early eighties. BBC comedies are always fun, right? You know, the production value is not all there. The laugh track is it had been laughter. I don't think it's a studio audience, although it may have been, I don't know, it was hard to tell that. So that's during the transition. But there were other shows not on your Nelly and the Sweeney. And the titles of both of those shows come from actual cocking rhyming slang as well. Yeah, the Sweeney is particularly dense. It's short for Sweeney Todd, which was rhyming slang for Flying Squad, which is a particular branch of the Metropolitan Police, Kind of like major case trousers. Sweeney was like the major case division of Metropolitan Police. So Nellie comes from the word Nellie Duff, the name Nellie Duff, which is apparently just a nonsense name. And that rhymes with Puff, which means life. So not on your Nelly means not on your life. Yeah, clearly, it's so dense. And then, of course, things like you mentioned the guy. Ritchie really brought it into the American consciousness in the nineties when he made those two movies, right? You broke into my consciousness, will tell you that. Yeah, sure. So there's a really good question, Chuck, that I think we need to ask. How is it that in 2019 You and I are analyzing a hyper local slang that came out of the 18 forties in, you know, some very specific part of London. Like how? How is cocky rhyming slang still around? After all this year, all these years when so much other Sling has come and gone over the years that we have no idea ever even existed? What's the staying power of cocky rhyming slang? You expect me to have an answer? I don't have one about why it stuck around other than people, you know, people don't still use it. Then it would have fallen by the wayside. So clearly it's popular. Yeah, seems to have gotten and maybe this is just my recognition of it, but seems to have gotten more popular in the last 20 years. What I was reading is that especially in the UK, it's popularity is based on Kitchen ISS. Yeah, you know, kind of like a hipster. Irony, huh? Like the cock knee rhyming word for wife is trouble and strife. So imagine that probably doesn't go over very well if you don't call your wife that with a smile like you're joking, right? Kind of thing. So I think that's the um, that's the current use of it. But I mean, it's it was used in. It's still in use in. There's still knew words like Posh and Becks is the word for sex. Really, That's pretty new. Uh, apparently Britney Spears can be used for beers, which is great. And I saw one, um, Nelson Mandela. If you're getting Estella Arts wa yeah, is it Nelson Mandela for Stella? So the fact that it's still evolving, still being contributed to new like these existing words are being replaced with new ones. Um, and the fact that it's 150 years old. I mean, there's got to be some thing to it that makes it more, more. I think I think it's that it's just so hard to understand until someone explains it to you. I think it's fun. I think it's a few fold. It's fun. That's Deb. It's fun. It's fun. It's Ah, there is a code to it. And part of the fun is it, I think his friends, maybe trying to make something up in having it catch on. Sure, it's almost like a game like a word game. Yeah. Bit. Did you just go a bit? And then, um the the unique Britishness of it all? Yeah. Is has a lot to do with it, I think. Yeah. Because even though it got exported to Australia, no one associates it with us. Sorry, Australia, but if we like, if it really took off in America with hipsters, people in Britain would probably like. Forget it. It's fun. It's fun. Oil has flown the coop. What could you say for Coop? It's, um it's ah, on the GW. Anything? The group. So the Gwyneth it's flowing the Gwyneth. Okay, we'll see that one might catch on. You can do this all day, you know, some aren't so good, but other ones are Jim. Uh, why of it? Although to begin with I thought was interesting. Um, I asked you why, and you said you don't know. You said, Why is it sticking around? Why did start to begin with? Okay. And I think you know, it makes a pretty good point that there just rhyming period has always been a thing, even in the states. And he uses examples like see you later, Alligator. After a while, crocodile like I remember saying that when I was a kid. I just said that yesterday. Did you Really? Yeah. See you later, Alligator. There's just something about it. Maybe it's the childlike nature of it. That's fun. Makes old people feel young again. Yeah. I mean, like, it takes something boring and adds a little flair to it, you know? Or like Yiddish, Like fancy shmancy. A lot of people say that kind of stuff all the time. I never associate it with Yiddish, but it absolutely is, isn't it? I think so. I mean, not outright Yiddish, but, Ah, Yiddish culture. I think so. Um, but yeah, it is strange. It is strange that it started to begin with. And like, I wish there was a definite, like, person zero that we could point to. Yeah, and, you know, on the streets of London, and someone thought it was funny. And then they told two friends and so on and so on. But Richie started it. And posse and Ralph mouth ticket from there, and it just kept spreading like wildfire. You got anything else? Ah, yes. I found a 2012 survey by the Museum of London and, ah, it set off a bunch of articles about how cocky Rheiman slang is dying. But if you read the article, it says that 40% of respondents believe it was dying, which means 60% don't believe it's dying. Yeah, so yeah, And then they could go on to talk about how there's all these new words that are being replaced and added, So I don't think it's going anywhere. I think it's usages become more ironic and everything, but it's still like most. Most Britons still understand Porky pies means lies. Yeah, like don't tell me any Porky's Give it to me straight. Well, I think it was good. We're able to sit here and have a good rabbit and pork. Sure, torque, apparently rabbit and pork is talk. But oh, that was one other thing studying this. There's reasons people study this. It gives you a window into the past, for example, Pronunciations? Yes. So farthing used to be, um, a Camden. Well, far things like 1/4 penny that they don't use anymore. But it used to be called a Camden after Camden Gardens, which tells linguists if they would get off their deaths and study this thing that they used to pronounce farthings as far Dent's. Oh, interesting. Or at least it's something that rhyme closely to gardens. But that's why people study this allegedly amazing. Well, if you want to know more about cocky rhyming slang, get yourself a great cock knee rhyming dictionary and go to England and just start talking up a storm. They love that stayed love. They can't get enough. They'll treat you like one of their own. That's wrecked on. Since we said that it's time for listener May satanic panic. We just re released that it's a Saturday select. I think that was. Is that one of your picks for one of mine? I don't know. I'm not sure. But it was. It was a good pick for October 1 of our favorite episodes. Yeah, I think of all time. We got a lot of people e mailing again about it after listening to it for the first time. Hey, guys, listen to satanic panic and realize that a story about that I grew up in a suburb of California by the teenage years had become. What you might call got were black spiked jewelry, dark makeup, and all that stuff. My town had a 10 p.m. Curfew on one night when I was 14 my friends and I were walking home after curfew got pulled over by the cops. They questioned and searched us. Thank all the parents, except for mine. Not sure why, but the officer insisted on driving me home once there. He also demanded to come inside my home. I was too scared to argue, so I let him in. He went to my bedroom. This is getting creepy. Yeah. I was really worried about where this is headed. Hey. Went to my bedroom, which is full of posters of Marilyn Manson in the Crow and stuff like that. And he started going through my things. What? He told me he was concerned because Satan mister out there and that if I wasn't careful, I'd find myself sacrificed. He told me there were rituals and Barnes that require virgins, and I should rethink my lifestyle. Before I got raped or hurt, I thanked him for his concern and I quietly said everything nice that I could to get him out of my house before he woke up. My father situation. This happened in 2000. After hearing your episode today, it's hard to believe that the residue that the satanic panic would still be around then, especially in the police force. Just to be clear, the suburb I lived in had very little crime. So the officer was very surprising indeed. My boys and I love your show. I recommend it to everyone. That is, from Lisa G. Really something, Lisa. I know. Kind of disturbing. Yeah, like I don't I don't know if that cop was a good guy. It started to go down a pretty creepy road there. It really did. Yeah. Maybe he was just looking for some pot or something. Just coming up with the cover story, E. I got to get your Emma Gauthier's Genny weed. Yeah, really? Who? I was relieved to know that it just ended in cop leaving, but agreed you went above and beyond. And not in a good way. Right. Well, thanks a lot, Lisa. And glad that you made it through that and that you and your boys were listening to stuff you should know. Could you get any cooler? I don't think so.

If you complete the episode within 17 hours of beginning it. Then you you win. Well, we did an episode on marathons. Um, almost one year ago. Really? Little more. October 9th, 2018. Okay. And, um, we did a lot of joking about marathons and how we're not into running those. So we should define here in minute 21. What an Ironman races? Because an Ironman race is a 2.4 mile swim. Okay, that's 3.9 kilometers. It's a lot. And then that's a lot of swimming. Then they say, All right, get out of the water, everybody. Now go ride your bike. 112 miles, right? Like two days later, though, right? No. Right afterward. What? Ah, 180.3 kilometers. And then when you're done with that, they say, All right, who wants to run a marathon? And then people like us are most people. I think in the world. Probably 99% of the people in the world think What is wrong with you people? Yeah, I'm not 1/2 marathon quarter marathon. 10th of a marathon. A full 26.2 mile marathon more than 42 kilometers on in all of this. By the way, if you're at the World Championships is taking place in the lava fields of Kona, Hawaii, where it's very hot. Yeah. Good coffee, too. It is. Okay. I guess I'm not huge on Kona coffee. Really know. Okay. Did you hear? There was once a coffee heist in Hawaii where somebody somehow stole something like $2 million worth of either a 1,000,000 or $2 million worth of Kona coffee beans. That sounds like a short stuff. It does. Maybe we should do that. Some of the great Cook Kona coffee heist. There's your title of aught six. Is that when it was? I don't know, but it sounded pretty good. Okay, that's the other big complaint on iTunes is that we just make out fax. That's true, right? So I think you kind of laid it out there. Three big reasons why you and I will never do. Ah, Iron Man, Triathlon, swimming, the biking in the running. That's right. That's right. But all of them combined to That's why if you put all of them together, you understand why the Iron Man has this kind of aura of just just all among athletes because the people who participate in these are the fittest of the fit. They have the greatest endurance of any other athlete around, especially ones who make it to the championships in Hawaii. Um, and it has, like, kind of a mystique. And here's the thing. The term Iron Man is gender neutral eso where you fall on the gender spectrum and you complete the race. That's an important part of this. Well, yeah, you will be called an iron man. Yep. And I guess if you are a collective, you have a bunch of people who have completed an Iron Man race that would be called Iron Men. But if you're talking about different Ironman races collectively because they have them all over the world now, I believe they have 260 races a year in 44 different countries that are official Iron Man race is, um, you would call those Iron Man's look the little glossary in this vehicle. Up next, we'll talk about whether you call your desktop mouse a maester meat. So the Iron Man race is we're gonna get into some of the history here. It's a it's a triathlon, right? And there. There were triathlons before the Iron Man competition. Yeah, I think starting a few years before the first iron man. So it actually kind of caught hold pretty quick. But technically, uhm, a triathlon can be any three sports. But when you say triathlon and then you follow that up with, yeah, I'm gonna play some basketball, toss a football around and then maybe take a few swings with a tennis racket, you'd be like, That's 33 Disparate sports of people are going to say you're you're weird because when you hear triathlon in this new, not new. But I guess fairly new since the seventies, you're really talking about swimming, cycling and running, right? Not necessarily in that order, whatever. But as long as those three were together, your that's a triathlon. And the first triathlon from what we understand, came out of San Diego, actually from the San Diego Track Club, who put the 1st 1 together in 1974. And it just so happened that in that in that first triathlon and 97 4 there's a guy named John Collins who was an officer in the Navy who said, Hey, this is kind of fun and ended up being stationed from Caen in San Diego to Hawaii in yeah, really put a terrible life. He was just chasing UFOs in San Diego. Next thing you know, he's sipping Mai tais on the beach in Honolulu. But we do thank him for his service. Sure. So John Collins ends up in Hawaii is like, Hey, you, you Ah, rubes, you hicks. I've got a great idea. It's gonna blow your blow your heads off. You ready a triathlon? And everyone said, What's that? Yeah, because Hawaii already had it. Had it going. Except not all combined had endurance sports. So there was obviously always marathons of Honolulu Marathon. Sure, there was something called the Waikiki Rough Water Swim here. Been to Waikiki? I've never been to Hawaii, Man. Man, you got to go. It's really a wonderful place. It's Ah, Emily and I were talking about going away for a birthday weekend and just you can't do Hawaii in a weekend from Atlanta. No, it's a long It's a little too long. Yeah, Savannah is much more realistic. Sure, it's the Hawaii of the Southeast. Everywhere in Savannah will tell you. Ah, and then they had something called the around Oahu bike ride. And so, as at endurance athletes like to do in all athletes, I like to get together and tease each other about who's the best athlete. Ah, the NASCAR guys were always there saying, We're athletes to sure, right? And they always get tickled by the football guys like Stop, stop. You're not really athlete to drive a car. So I think my brother and I actually had one of our rare arguments about NASCAR guys being athletes. It's better than that stupid thing about a hot dog being a sandwich or not well. And when I say argument, as much as my brother and I get into arguments, which is me saying, Hey, I'm not in a NASCAR but these guys were athletes, my brother saying notto buy it And then we say, Let's go play Ping pong. Yeah, you guys were like, Well, this is getting out of hand. Please, Brother was reconcile with some pink phone. So Collins, all this arguing was going on about who was the most fit. And hey said, You know what? Let's let's throw all these together like you said, we'll call it the Iron Man. And in 1978 there were 12 finishers. I'm not sure how many people entered that race, but 12 people finished it and were named Ironman. Right? And they all got little hand main. Ah, iron, um, statuettes or whatever. Yeah, Yeah, it was It was kind of a thing in that first iron Man. It was really crazy. Like one guy ran out of water. It's so everybody had to have their own support staff with with them, Like supplying water and stuff like that before they had people along around? Yes, in one guy named Dunbar. I can't remember his first name, but he was in the first competition. They called him Dunbar. You probably he ran out or his support staff ran out of water. So he toward the end of the marathon, he had nothing to drink but Budweiser. Shut up. I'm not kidding. John Collins. Who was the guy who brought it to Hawaii? He stopped for a bullet. Chili at one point, Thio refuel. Yeah, it was nuts, but it was just basically like some some crazy, athletic military guys. Just having fine Ebola chilly, huh? Ebola chili like, hadn't draft behind me at area, right? Exactly. I mean, you just eat it into just passed right through your mouth and out of your rectum, right onto the street. You know what? So, um but this first was It was fun. It was crazy. But there's this ongoing dispute to this day I read, I think, in an article in the New York Times, that is that said that, um, in the rule book, if you ran in that first re participated in that first Ironman competition, part of the entry fee was agreeing to sign on to be the organizing committee for the Iron Man. And, um, they put that in there to basically say, Like, if you sue, you're actually suing yourself too. So you probably don't want to sue if you get injured or fall over. Drop that or something. Um, but some people, including Dumb Bar, have interpreted that to mean that they were part owners of Iron Man, which has now become like a $1,000,000,000 global franchise and the people in charge like now, you you don't have anything to do with that. You can get sued, but you can't read for benefits, right? exactly, but it was a pretty interesting article. Camera was called, but it's it's worth looking up. Wow, that is interesting. I thought so, too. So, Ah, Soon after this, it started to become a media event. In that, um, we've talked before about the greatest show support show in the history of sport shows, which was a B C's wide world of sports. Fantastic. I never really watched it. I was always like this means cartoons air over for this Saturday and I loved it. I mean, that's where you know, is a kid. In the eighties, you got introduced ski jumping and curling and iron manning, and but that was sort of the deal. If you never watched that show is it was the wide world of sports so that it wasn't It was, you know, lumberjack competitions and all these sort of to the to the side sports that you had never heard of before. It was pretty cool. Fringe sports. Yeah. Ah, Sports Illustrated started covering it, which was a big deal that was really gave it a shot in the arm because that was 1979 the 2nd 1 and Sports Illustrated did like a 10 page spread on it basically really gathered attention for it. And there's still one of the top sports rags. But back then they weren't the only one, but they were sort of the name in sports writing for sure. So it was a big deal. I had a subscription for many, many, many years, and then came the swimsuit issue. And you're like, No, this has nothing do with sports. I looked forward to that so often as a young church boy. It sure ladies in their bathing suits what was better than that as far as I knew sports. So, uh, I remember my first issue to still, it was Mohammed Ali was on the cover, believe it or not, of the swimsuit issue. Was it the one where he's standing over is a Joe Frazier now? No, no, no. This was after that. This was in his sort of sad last comeback attempt. I'm not familiar with that. Yeah, when he was older, he you know, he kind of boxed beyond his prime. Oh, I didn't know because I'm not 70 years old. He replies. Sure. So I just did the math. I was like, Well, I have Chuck looks this one passed by. But now I mean Joe Frazier. Now, that was before my time. But yes, for some reason, that always sticks out is the cover said, Look who's back Mohammad Ali and then parentheses with moustache. I want to say I want to say here, everybody, Chuck does not have this cover in front of him right now. From memory, totally from memory. It's impressive. I saved all those for many years, and then I think my mom finally got rid of him. I had just an attic full of Sports Illustrated's Yeah, I know what you mean. But I saved the bathing suit issues. You never saw those. He had, like a, uh, air vent cover that you could just pull off the wall. You have a false floor, right, Dad? Yeah. Um, all right. So, back to the event, it's being covered by the media and with within just a few years after that, people started entering the race. More and more people saw it on TV. They're like, Hey, I'm an extreme athlete. Uh, I'm gonna get into this. And it grew to the point where they moved it. Finally in 1981 2 It's Ah, It's now home forever home in Kona, Hawaii if you're talking the world championship, right. And can we talk for a second about Julie Moss here? Sure, because she pretty much single handedly launched Iron Man into the status. The legendary status that it has today. Yeah, very soon after it was originated. She was a kinesiology student at, um I think cowl Paulie saying Luis Obispo. Did I say that, right? I don't know. You just sound so sure of yourself. Well, you lived in California, so I didn't know if I just Sam San Luis Obispo. Sure, I said that. That's what I said. Yeah. Okay. Well, anyway, she was a kinesiology student. That part wrong? No, it's not. Okay. Um, and her dissertation was participating in the Iron Man, um, competition in 1982 in Hawaii. And so she went and she ran and she could not believe it. But all of a sudden, she's in front, is an elite. She's barely trained for this thing. She'd done some running before, and now all of a sudden, she's winning the fourth ever Iron Man competition. And, um, as she got, like within something like 40 yards of some ridiculously short distance from the finish line. After she'd swam, biked and run almost an entire marathon, her body gave out and she remember this She you did on the y bro sports. It was being covered on the wide world of sports. 20 million people were watching and Julie Moss collapsed and then crawled across the finish line to finish second to finish second. She was lapped, and I think the winner her name was, um, Kathleen McCartney. Kathleen McCartney was was what had to be told that she just wants. She didn't realize what had just happened. She's like, You mean that person I just stepped on? I was a runner and I shoot my waffle print. Few mark is on their back still, Um, but Julie Moss, like, just became just amazingly like celebrated sports figure overnight from showing this kind of grit and determination, and it became like, kind of a hallmark of the Iron Man competition, that people would collapse and then crawl over the fish finish line because it required that much of the human body, but also because they were that determined to reach that goal and that was it for the Iron Man. It just became hugely popular overnight. You were talking about how much participation grew. I saw that, um, in 1982 the year Julie Moss entered. There were 60,000 people who entered 400 triathlons, not necessarily Iron Man competitions. In three years, 1.1 million people competed in 2100 triathlons by 1985 so she definitely boosted the popularity a tad bit. Well, why don't we take a break and we'll come back and talk a little bit about the science of why people other than Julie Moss pass out right when they get to the finish line? That's good, Yes.

Why endurance athletes struggle there. The very end, aside from the obvious and what they're doing is super hard. But it turns out that it's ah, there. It's overheating largely in it. That's so there's a great debate, like either they run out of fuel like they basically just use up all of their stores of energy, and they just their body can't go on any longer or, um, they have overheated. Is that this is what this article is basically saying an outside magazine, the other big one is that the lactic acid right in particular the hydrogen ions have built up in the muscle and are causing cramping and everything going haywire. But this guy, Brent Ruby, who's a physiologist at University of Montana, he's basically saying, though all of it comes down to overheating. And at this point, like your body enters a shutdown mode where your brain is like Okay, light out. I'm not gonna let you lift your foot any longer. Like you physically can't do that with your muscle because I'm not allowing it. Yeah, because the brain, hey, says, is sending you these messages. Ah, lot before this happens, right? Like, stop. Stop doing what you're doing. You better stop. You better stop. If you don't stop, I'm gonna stop for you. Ah, and this is not necessarily dehydration either. He said you could be plenty hydrated and drinking tons of water. Um, but you know that the heat at some of these Iron Man's is pretty punishing. And especially, he said, after you've done the swimming event, which can keep the temperature down. Yeah, obviously, because the water and then the cycling, where you've got a lot more breeze generally especially coming out of swimming. So your perspiration is doing a better job of cooling you off. Yeah, but when you get to that marathon that that final leg, it can be pretty brutal. And eventually your body, after sending all those messages, just says you're not listening to me. So we're going down, right? And like your your movements become uncoordinated. You're like your actual brain might start malfunctioning as well. Where just You're not thinking clearly any longer, you become distracted, like if you've ever watched it. Actually, it's it's really weird to watch these things, but there's plenty of, like finish line footage from Iron Man competitions of of these, some of them, some of the fittest athletes on the planet collapsing before the finish line like collapsing after the finish line is one thing collapsing before they get to the finish line. Because their bodies, their brains, have said This is it. I'm done. You you haven't listened, so I'm just taking charge here. And you can't. I'm not letting you move any longer because you need to cool down. Yeah, I wonder too. If anyone has explored the mental, Um, like where? Like when you see the finish line. If something happens in your brain like physically seeing it with your eyeballs, I kind of like if you have to, if you have to poop really bad or that brain bladder connection we talked about. Well, yeah, exactly. A bladder or poop. You know, you're holding it, you're holding it. And then when your hand touches the door knob to your house for your apartment, that is when some release happens in your brain or something. What if that happens when you see that finish line? You know, Chuck, you're not supposed to poop your pants when you touch a door knob. It's unusual. Well, there have been tri athletes to, uh, and endurance athletes that have pooped their their pants near the finish line. It's very sad. Yeah, I think we talked about that marathons, that there's a lot of pants pooping, Yeah, going on. But yeah, I'm sure that seeing that finish line has some sort of effect because there's also there's a documented effect called the Post Iron Man Blues, where they're not in any way people people will enter like a state of depression for a couple of weeks following completing an iron Man, and they actually can't quite explain it. They think that it's probably related to having set such a lofty goal, right that once you achieve it like life kind of loses its luster for a little while. Other people think that your brain is sending you to depression so that you have no will to get out there and try that again any time soon. Ate both of them. Make a lot of sense, and maybe it's a combination of the two. Interesting. So Ironmen uh, Iron Man's right started growing and growing the World championship in Kona and they have championships. We should point out on most continents they have their own championship like the African Championship. South American European right? But the world championship is the Hawaii one. Yeah, that's still the one in Kona, and the entries there are limited. And generally, unless you win the lottery, which is only about 500 people, you have earned your way in by qualifying in another sanction Iron Man event. Right? And I actually saw that they did away with the lottery really isn't. Yeah, 2015 was last year. They did it and it was a really great thing because you could pay 50 bucks to enter a lottery and to win a slot 500. There were 500 slots, like you said. And if you because you might not qualify because to qualify for Hawaii, you literally have to be one of the most fittest, most well trained athletes on the planet. We're talking out of, you know, tens of thousands of people who are, like, possibly able to reach this state. Your 1500 of those people this lottery gave people who wanted to give it a try. But weren't professional endurance athletes a chance to get in there? So it was a great program, but at the same time, the federal government's that. Actually, what you're doing is running an illegal gambling operation. We want you to shut it down now. Interesting. So the Ironman had had to stop doing the lottery. Now they have something called a legacy program, which says that if you've competed or completed, I believe in 12 Ironman competitions that aren't the championship. U, um can apply to get a legacy slot where they're basically saying like, This is what we're trying to encourage. So come on and try your hand at the world Championships. So they renamed the lottery the Legacy. But I think the difference is that you don't pay for that opportunity. Now. I got you. I think, in 1994 they eventually added triathlons to the Olympics on. We'll get two different distances. Certainly don't knock Olympic triathletes, but no, but I could completely. It's nothing like the Iron Man. Let's just say it's much shorter. It's smaller, for sure. But if you're talking Iron Man, it starts out with the swimming leg. And as we said earlier, that's the 2.4 mile swim. And how do you pronounce that? Well, I can tell you why. And you say all of the all of the vowels. Kiowa? I think so. Okay. Kahlua, Kona Bay. Yeah, I think you just nailed it, man. We'll see. Okay. And, uh, depends on the water temperature, whether or not you're allowed to wear a wetsuit. But, um, the wet suit gives you a little bit of a buoyancy advantage, so I think the ah, well, I'm not gonna get in ahead of tri athletes. But it was me. I would hope for a little bit colder water so I could wear my wetsuit. Plus it would keep you cooler too. Right? But if the water is warmer than you don't need the wetsuit, you know what I mean, Right? You could just swim naked, I think is what you're saying is exactly what I'm saying. So the I was reading about, you know, um, injuries and deaths was just talk about a little more, but the swim leg sounds like it would be not the easiest, but maybe the most comfortable because you're in the water and yeah, you can sweat while you're swimming in all of that, but at least you're staying cool. But supposedly something like that. Somebody did a study of deaths between, I think, 1985 and 2016 in triathlons, not just Iron Man. And they found that of 135 deaths, sudden deaths and heart attacks and stuff. 90 of those took place in the swim leg. Wow. And they think possibly possibly that people are so amped up about participating in this iron man that once they start exercising in the water. They just have a heart attack. And these are people who are in the fittest, impossible state they can be in. And they're still dying of heart attacks at age 40 or something like that. Well, they stagger the beginning. Obviously, like most races and foot races, they stagger them in the water because you can't just throw all those people in the ocean at once. You're pros. They're going to start out first again, like most road races, foot races. But if you're nonprofessional, I guess everyone in there is professional. And then is what you're basically saying, right? Almost everybody Okay. Ah, and then you finish the swimming leg. Hopefully, unless you die of a heart attack, all right? And then you go to what's called T won the first transition area, and that's where you change your clothes and you put on your clothes for the next thing, which in this case is biking. They try to make it where it's a loop, so there's only one transition area. So you finish the bike race where he started, and that's where you will also start the run. But I love this one line in the article he did to me how stuff works. Racers must find their bike in rows of Rex with hundreds of other bikes. That sounds like part of the game. Almost the way threatened. Right? Right. And they call the transition period or to the transition point where if you can't find your bike the T s point. No, they don't know. Don't you remember where you put your biker? Do they mix them up? Is that part of the fun? I don't know, Like I put it here, man. I put it here. I don't know. Surely somebody's accidentally taken somebody's bike, so I mean, but how would you identify who took your bike so you could take their bike like you just be? I don't know how you would do that, because it would be a bad jam if somebody took your bike. Because you're apparently the bike leg is where you're doing the most other stuff, like eating refueling, that kind of style. Interesting. So you probably have a significant amount of calories that you're planning on consuming on your bike that you've been training t eat during this race all this time. So if somebody takes your bike. They're taking more than just your bike. They're taking your fuel. If it be a big deal, I'm sure so I don't know how they how they keep up with that kind of thing and prevent that from happening. And that's where you have your Netflix queue it up on your phone that's mounted on the front of your bike. That's right. So you can watch a couple of movies? Yeah, that's a lot of lot of miles 100 plus miles. Yeah, I saw it. Something like the average completion time for this bike leg is something like six hours other. They give you 10? Yeah, that's that's the bulk of the Iron Man is the biking part. Yeah, because it's 100 something, Miles. What was it? 112? Yeah, I'm fine with 100 something because I'll never come even remotely close to it. Ah, and depending on what Iron Man course you're on or what triathlon you're you're participating in. The train's going to be a little worse or better, depending on where you are. Apparently in Kona, it's pretty rough because of the winds. Right? And they can just flat knock you off of a bike. Well, plus, you're also going through active lava fields, so the winds are blowing like a furnace of hot air on to you while you're biking cheese. Yeah, it's brutal, this terrible thing to do. Like, you have to be insane to try this kind of thing. Especially the championships. Yeah, so, like we mentioned, you do have 17 hours to finish. And after that, even if you finish, which is a great accomplishment, you're not dubbed in Iron Man, which is kind of sad. So there's something called them the midnight finish, where people who have completed the Ron and, like, you know, started toe, feel sore and have eaten and started drinking beer and everything afterward. Um, probably just make a little ultra, though I'm sure, um, they will go around midnight to see the very last people coming on, and that's great. And that's supposed to be super inspirational because these are people who, as far as the Iron Man site describes it, they're just getting to the iron Man. To compete has probably been a tremendous amount of, um has really been struggle. And so these people are finishing one way or another. So I guess people have already finished. They're there to kind of cheer him on. That's awesome On we'll talk more about this later, but there are people with prosthetic limbs and, uh, wheelchair athletes that complete this stuff in this one. Well, we'll talk about the father and son team, which is just incredible. Yeah, but we're gonna save that, right? So people stick around. Yeah, through the dumb and boring. All right, so and the moseying? That's right. Ah, you are not allowed to draft like in some bike races drafting Just like NASCAR. You can get behind a another biker and cut down on wind resistance. But in most of the Ironman man competitions, that is not allowed on. And there was one case in 86 where a race winner, Patricia, uh, Punt house was disqualified for drafting Is that he'd say your name puntos. I want to say like, Ponch is like punches pilot. But that's not right. Punto us. Yeah, I think you got it. I'm just gonna go with the standard penthouse. I'm going to go with the Hawaiian pronunciation and say pon toes and they went over on shoes. That's good but juice punch shoes. I like that the most so far. And then you could win money. Um, I I looked at the world championships and I think there's like, a a $650,000 total purse. And it looks like Is it 150 grand for each male and female winner? Ah, yes. Somewhere around there's something like 115 or 150 or something like that. But I mean, like, if you are, you know, a high, um high end elite tri athlete ranking. Yeah, yes, whatever you want to call if you're, like the best of the best, you could make a decent living doing this. And this is like what you want to do anyway, So you can certainly make enough to, you know, make it from triathlon to triathlon. You're like you. If you're not the literally the best of the best, you're not go ever going to get rich off of it. But if you are up there, and especially if you're visible on people like you in addition to the persons that you'll win for winning these triathlons, um, you will also get sponsorships as well, so you can make a pretty decent living being. Ah, an elite tri athlete. But I saw, for example, there's this guy right now. Um, yon Friday. No, he is from Germany and he is as good as it as they've ever come. As faras male competitors go and in 2015 from purses from winning events over five events, he made $213,000 which is a pretty decent living there, competing in five Iron men, Bad or Iron Man's. Um, the guy who made the most that year from winnings was a guy named Javier Gomez. He won 287,000 which is really even better, but he had to compete in 14 Iron Man's to to make that. So I think the real cheese is in the sponsorship. Yeah, and I think 14 like, I don't think they recommend you do that many. No more than one a month is not recommended, but we need to talk about this guy named James Lawrence. Then if we're talking about doing that, you ready? How many has he done in 2015? My friend James Lawrence, also known as the Iron Cowboy, 25 competed in 50 Iron Man's in 50 states in 50 days. Wow. Over the course of 50 consecutive days, he competed in 50 Iron Man in Iron Man. Today for 50 days, they should just call him the ultimate Iron Man and just shut everything else down. They did. They're not going to shut it down, because, again, it's pretty lucrative. But they did. They just basically said, There's no one could ever top that. That's insane. Like the fact that he's still alive is really impressive. That is amazing. Yeah, he was eating like 67,000 calories. I'm sorry. 7 to 8000 calories a day every morning. He said his toenails were falling off. Um, like he was like, Yeah, it was impressive to say the least. That he did that. Yeah. What's going on in his brain? I don't know. He really doesn't like himself. Uh, should we take another break? All right, let's take another break. And then we will do the very unlikely thing where in Josh and I will talk about how to train for a triathlon right after this. Theo. Hey, friends. We want to talk to you about the future of phone service because it is here and it's called visible. Yet for 40 bucks a month, all in you get unlimited data messages and minutes on Verizon's four G l T E Network and Visible doesn't do annual contracts. They also don't do shady hidden fees or foot long phone bills, either. When they say 40 bucks a month, they mean 40 bucks a month. Yeah, and when they say, unlimited data, that means unlimited data. They also don't have physical phone stores. That means no waiting in lines or dealing with annoying sales. People with visible you can sign up by a new phone or bring your own device. Get help. That's a tap away via chat, text or tweet and get better phone service all from their app or website without ever leaving your couch. Yep, so are you ready to learn more? Switch to visible than head too visible dot com slash stuff and get $20 off your first month of service. An exclusive special offer just for stuff you should know listeners that's visible dot com slash stuff. Okay, chuck, we should probably qualify. This was saying like we were going to tell you how to train from stuff we've read about training. Not for many life experience. No, uh, if you're gonna train and we do the same thing in the marathon's podcasts, we're not experts. But here's what they say. Experts do say Sure, if you're going to train for a triathlon, especially in Iron Man, you're gonna need to take your time if you've never done it, it could be an entire year of training if you're new to this kind of stuff, right? And they say generally, obviously, you need to really build your endurance up, not worry about your speed yet. Yes, well, that's a that's yes. Yeah, that's just 0.1. Is your training for endurance your training to increase what's called your VO two? Max. That's what is the amount of oxygen you can take in and and your body used to burn fuel right? You're also going to need to rest, even though you really, really want to do this, and you're super fired up to train. If you don't, you gotta rest and give your body a chance to recover right? It's a big one. I think that that's just like your body is going to tell you to do that. Regardless, they say train to your weakness. So there's a surprising to me. But it makes sense when you think about it. Yeah, like if you're if you run marathons or long distance bike races and you're used to that and you're good at that and you think, Hey, I want to add these other two things, then maybe work on those other two things a little bit more, at least in the earlier part of your training, right? But as you get a little closer to time, you want to go back to your strength and remember to boost that up again. You can't forget about running that 26 miles. Oh, I haven't done a marathon in over a year. I've just been biking and swimming, and now it's time to run a marathon after biking and swimming. That's not a situation we want to be in. That's right. Ah, and then, I mean, these last ones were kind of kind of dumb and boring. Well, no, no. More dumb and boring than us. I guess this makes sense. Use the equipment that you're going to use at the event. So, like, right, don't switch bikes before no, Or Or for God's sakes, don't switch out your Speedo. All right. You want to wear your lucky Speedo that you haven't washed all year? That's right. Um, so that makes sense. Also, this is a grab store article, we should say, and Ed makes a pretty good point like you need Thio Train just to be able to start training for the Iron Man. Yeah, like this is, This is not It's not something you just start where you go from like couched Ironman. There's that doesn't exist. There's no such thing you want to like start to get in shape first, and then you can start training for the Ironman, and it makes a pretty good point. I think it's worth saying here, um, talk to a doctor first, especially if you're not in the best shape or, you know you have an existing medical condition because a lot of people don't realize it's like, Yes, it's crazy what the body goes through and that you know these air amazing feats of endurance. But it's possible there is some biology or biological science that says, actually, if you're engaging in endurance sports over time, you're actually more likely to do things like die of a heart attack or get pancreatic cancer than somebody who doesn't participate in endurance sports. And science is a little bit confounded by this. Yeah, there was one study out of the University of Toronto that said endurance athletes are 3 to 5 times likelier to experience atrial defibrillation. Um, there was one out of Norway, which is probably what you were talking about. Yeah, it says you're two times, uh, at the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. That's being twice as likely. Yeah, I mean, they're saying they think what happens is that and they did blood test to people like the beginnings and during the middle and at the end. And they said they think your body goes into sort of a temporary state of immuno suppression, right? And that if you just if you keep doing this over and over, it could have overall cumulative effect. Yeah, because your inflammation is so set off because your body is like, what is going on? Um, there Inflammation markers from one test I saw are up like 250% over just normal resting rate. And they think that you're immune system stands back because if it over, if it tried to deal with all of the different inflammation going on, it would over exert itself and you'd be toast in a different way. So they think that all of this damage from inflammation and then a lowered immune response to the inflammation creates thes, prolonged problems that Onley endurance athletes can can experience. Have you heard of doubling? No. So their endurance athletes that practice doubling and they're specifically people who do do. It's called the Double Boston, which is They get up in the middle of the night and they run the Boston Marathon in reverse, right, and then stop at the finish It stop it, finish at the start line, right and then run the regular marathon I actually have, and I think I ran across that as well. And I think we should do like an episode on ultra thorns ultramarathons because there are some crazy stuff that goes into that, too. Oh, yeah, like, you know, let's run 120 miles to the desert, right? Which is that's a terrible idea, but people do it and I think it's worth talking about. Yeah, people used to do that in biblical days to deliver messages of war. A sure but like not for fun. Yeah, not for fun. And they would always drop dead upon delivering the message. It seems like they go it's and then fall over dead. And somebody else would say, Monty Python's flying circus message for you, sir, S o. There are no statistics from the U. S. A. T. Um, But Ed picked out a 16 year old statistic from the Lake Placid Iron Man and said that this was a low number of injuries where they sent 14 people to the hospital from everything from just standard injuries to your body to obviously heat exhaustion and dehydration. Stuff like that. Yeah, and like even when you're when you complete this without injuries and without collapsing before the finish line or whatever well, you're putting your body through is just astounding. Um, you burned something like about 6000 calories throughout the day of competing in this Iron Man competition, and, um, you'll replenish a lot of it from like sports drinks and energy, drinks and stuff. But you lose about £20 of water. Wait Wow! About nine kilograms of water weight during the course of running and competing in an Ironman. Amazing. It is literally amazing that that happens to the human body and that people do that on purpose and that there are people out there who have trained at this so long and have built up their endurance so much that they can overcome their bodies. Normal biological responses to slowing down to sending cramps to the muscles to basically keep your motor functioning from from going forward as much as you wanted to. They can overcome this stuff, but sometimes to their own detriment, which results in collapsing and things like that. Well, we mentioned earlier the ah, the paltry little Olympic Triathlon, and we're kidding. But when you look at the distance is it is not close to an iron man. It is a 0.93 mile swim, one and 1/2 kilometres. Yeah, which is I guess why they settled on that, cause I was like, what a weird right. Why not just go a mile? But they're What's this weird Imperial? Yeah, exactly on. Then that's followed by a 24.86 mile, 40 kilometer bike ride. Okay. And then only a 6.21 or a 10 kilometer run. Right, which is again. I could do that. I mean, it's 20 miles shorter on the run side. Yeah, and 80 you know, close to 80 miles shorter, Earl. Yeah, a little more, actually. On the on the bike side. And then about a little less in half on the swim side. Right. Which again, is why people say, Like, the Ironman itself is just the endurance sport of endurance sports. And the iron man in Hawaii in particular, is like the pinnacle of it. So if you complete the Iron Man, especially if you win the Iron Man championship in Hawaii, you're you're as bad as they come. Yeah, I like this sprint one, though. The sprint triathlon. Ah, it's a depending on which one it is, either. Ah, like anywhere from 10.321 miles in the water, 8 to 25 miles on a bike, and then one and 1/2 to 5 miles running. But you are all out 100% full tilt the whole time, right? This is nice. Amazing. This is like something that in elementary school could do on field day or something. You know, remember those DEA l a field day, but it definitely reeks of something like an 11 year old makes up right? But there's no tree climbing involved. Right? And if somebody touches you after freeze until somebody else comes along, that touches you again, how I love field day, But looking back, I have no idea what that was for. Was it just a teacher free day or something, or what was the point? No, it was, uh, I think your own little Olympics to celebrate sport and introduce kids. Two different. Ah, two different sports. I got you. Okay? It was school. I was like, What's your angle here? What's what's really going on? You're a You had to sit in that day. Yeah, I did. I protested. He sat in your potato second yourselves, Right? Um, that my mom made me wear. So, um, we talked about Julie Moss. Like, over the years have been some people who have kind of risen to the to the cream of the crop from the Ironman Triathlon. And Julie Moss was definitely the first. But there've been others to, um there is a, uh, pair of people. Ah, man. And a woman who were kind of known is like the best of the best. For a while, the guy was named Luke Von Leered. You believe? I think I said that, right? He held the course record for a while at Kona eight minutes, eight hours, four minutes and eight seconds, which he set in 1996. But that guy that I spoke about earlier yon Friday No, he's just like he's good as they come. As faras male triathletes go, he currently holds the course record that I believe you just set a week ago in October 2019 7 hours, 51 minutes and 13 seconds. How Said sub eight hours. Yep. There's another woman competing right now who is, um, just the best of the best. I don't know if she's the all time best. I think that still is held by Paula Newby Fraser. But, um, her name is Daniella Lif e l Y f. She's a German, too. She holds the Kona course record now eight hours 26 minutes in 18 seconds. She said that in 2018. I can't even lay around and watch movies for eight hours, you know? Yeah, I think that's part of this, too. Is having the mental, um, stamina to stave off? You know, the voice in your head. That's like, Stop, stop. Go eat a hot dog. Stop! Stop. There's a gentleman name Marc with a c uh, chairman's. And he is a wheelchair athlete who has completed several Iron Man's. There's a nun in her seventies sister Madonna Buder, who every year that she competes, they have to create a new age group, which is amazing. All right. Did you look her up? Uh, no, I didn't. A man. She's a total be a nice. So she's still competing because this is an old article. Well, I don't know. She is now, but I just looked up, looked up photos of her in competition. Yeah, So she was competing in a 75 right? Yeah, but there's a man named Jim Ward who competed into his eighties. Well, and I think he was not finishing the racist by that point, But he did complete the race at age 77. Man, that's crazy. Yeah. Um, and you mentioned Ah, father son team. Team Hoyt. Yeah, man Team point. So the dad, Dick Hoyt, um, is charged with assisting his son, Rick Hoyt, who has cerebral palsy through the Iron Man and has done this more than once. Yes. Oh, Rick was born with brain damage because of a problem at birth, and he can't walk or talk. But hey has a communication device where he was able at one point to communicate that he loves sports. And a schoolmate of his was paralyzed in an accident. And Rick said, Dad, can we run a five K benefit race for my friend? They did that with Dick pushing Rick in a wheelchair and then said, Let's just keep the party going and moved up two marathons and eventually triathlons. Yep, that's pretty impressive. You remember in our cerebral palsy episode, we talked about Kyle Peas. Uh um, he's Ah, he's from Atlanta. He's one of our listeners and fan. He and his brother Brent have competed in Ironman competitions, too. I think they competed at the championship is, well, amazing. Yep. Yeah, you should check out pictures of Team point because, um, the sun rides in a raft while Dad tows him in the water on and then rides a bike with the seat up front for Rick. And it's just amazing and then pushes him in a wheelchair for the for the running leg. Yep. Pretty great stuff. Yeah, I can't imagine doing it myself, but also doing it, You know, with your son who has cerebral palsy. It's got a I mean, that's just amazing. Although, I bet you have, like, just this, Like, built in source of inspiration every time you start to get tired. Like, I better keep going. Totally. You know? Yeah. Variance. Which, actually, no, I mentioned it's kind of cheating. So, um, I got a couple other things. All right? Um, Chris Lee, very famously, they made, like, a Gatorade commercial out of it in the 1997. Coming a championship, um, collapsed right before the finish line. Had to have emergency surgery to remove half of his colon because it had become so oxygen starved during the race that it died. Wow. Okay, that's a big deal toe have happened to you while you're in the Iron Man race. And then there was also some other famous collapsing and crawling. Um really into those, huh? That's just amazing that people not only collapse, especially when you understand what's going on in their body. Um, but then the fact that they pick themselves up and keep going or crawl. Um, Shane, I think Shanor Sean Welsh. Ah, s I a n. I can't remember. The Gaelic pronunciation and Windy Ingram were both women competing in the Iron Man. I can't remember what year, but they came in fifth place in fourth place, respectively. Um, and they crawled. They were crawling, like, competing against one another, crawling over the to the finish line. Wow. It's really something to see as a perfect this is all. We all go watch those things. Now. You know what I like is when the, uh, you see those things where the person is, there's one person crawling and the person can win, but they go back and they pick that person up on the cross. The finish line together. Yeah, nothing better. No, there really isn't, um, one other thing, Chuck. And there's a ongoing dispute among marathoners in Iron Man competitors over which is harder and all that people say no. Marathon is way harder because you're competing flat out the whole time. Iron Man is more about endurance and iron man's like they, like you clearly have never been in iron Man. So I looked, and I think I've settled this once and for all. Yeah, Okay. The average finisher in a marathon. Just a marathon in the United States. I think a year or two ago was four hours and 35 minutes. Okay, so that's That's pretty good. It's a great time. I would love to have that in an iron Man. The average time to finish the marathon section with four hours and 54 minutes less than 20 minutes longer. And this is on top of already having done the swim leg in the bike ride leg. So I think that definitively proves that the Iron Man is tougher because most people are still running flat out in the marathon portion on top of having already done the swimming in the biking. Yeah. I mean, it's not even a debate. I didn't even need those numbers. Well, some people did, and now they've been swayed, and they'll never open their mouths about it again. Good. Ah, if you wanna know more about the Ironman Go out and start training. You could also do worse than going reading this article on how stuff works by our dear friend and Grabowski agreed. Since I say Grabowski, it's time for a listener mail. This is from our new friend Betty. Betty says this. From the time I was introduced to your show, I've been listening and trying to catch up on as many of your previous shows as possible. Uh, I'll make learning with personal connections, but hesitate to pest you about all of my thoughts. Recently, though, I completed a couple that convinced me it was time to write in specifically the Navajo Code talkers. I wondered if you knew that another group contributed. In a somewhat similar way, Louisiana Cajuns, who, like the Navajo, were not allowed to speak French on school grounds, served in World War Two as interpreters. Some, maybe even a spy's. A friend of mine shared with me that his dad went ashore at Normandy acting as an interpreter, and this is the first time I had heard of that. Wow. Also, when you mentioned the Navajo influence at Guadalcanal, I wondered if you had ever done a segment on the Battle of Savo Sound, the first ever nighttime naval battle in that battle. My father, ship and many others went down because of a sly attack from the Japanese in a series of communication errors. It was quite a debacle. Well, keep up the great work, guys. My phone travels with me all day and I'll be listening almost all of my waking hours trying to catch up. And that is from Betty. Thanks a lot, Betty. Good luck with catching up. Thanks for that. Awesome email. One of the better stories I've heard that didn't know about already. Yeah. We'll look into the Cajun thing for maybe a short stuff. Yep.

a99e0858-6066-406d-9c85-c754b10bae33,Short Stuff: The History of Paternity Testing,"Paternity testing. It wasn't science for many years, yet they still tried to do it. Learn all about it in 12 minutes.

I'm Josh. There's Chuck. There's Dave. Be quiet. Let's go. So we're talking about paternity testing in the history of paternity testing, which is amazing because it's all pretty new as faras really being able to do paternity testing. Yeah, you and I grew up in a world where I mean, pretty much is from the moment we realized that that would be an issue that somebody would need to solve. It was pretty much solved because of we. We grew up in a world where you could genetically test for paternity, like testing markers on white blood cells and produced basically 99.99% accurate assessment of whether somebody was the father of a child or not correct prior to us, coming of age in this age of genetic paternity testing. However, it was a really problem, Chuck. Yeah, like a longstanding problem, apparently, yes. We talk about the story of ST Anthony. I was hoping you'd ask 12th century priest ST Anthony. At one point a woman came to him and she said, You know what? My jealous husband thinks that he's not the father. He thinks I stepped out and cuckolded him. And, ah, he's threatening to kill me and this child. And so Anthony went to the family and said, I'm gonna do a test. It's called a paternity test And then he went to the little baby and said, Who's your daddy? Yeah, And the baby pointed to the jealous husband. This is an infant and said, That is my father. This is an infant. End of story. Um so ST Anthony said. Ha Chetta. And like, left as he was known to do and became a saint shortly after this right? The end of this episode. No, it's not the end because a very smart person named Narra Millen Itch, who's a history professor at Barnard College, has authored a book called Paternity Colon. The Elusive Quest for the Father, Where it Really? And Dave Ruse, R old pal, wrote this article, and, um and did he talk to Mira? I believe so, Yeah, and even interviewed her, and she really got down on this topic of researching the history of paternity. And it's pretty interesting because in the early days, like all early days of science and when there was a lot of pseudo science going on? Yeah, they were doing all kinds of wacky stuff. Yeah, because again, people were like water. What are we gonna do? We have no idea how to prove how to prove paternity or disproved fraternity. And there is a lot of people who really want an answer to this. So because the need was so great, um, quacks were allowed to kind of fill the void for a little while, especially apparently, in the 19 twenties, there was a, um The nation was gripped in a panic that babies were being switched in maternity wards in hospitals, too. So it wasn't just the idea that your wife stepped out on your head and affair, um, with another man and that this wasn't your child, like men and women wanted to be able to prove a child was theirs, But there was just no way to do that scientifically. So, like you said, pseudoscience said, Hey, we'll try this for a little while. Yeah, So, uh, quack might step in and say we need to look at the roof of the mouth because, uh, we want to determine if they've eaten any Captain Crunch peanut butter cereal lately. Just the flesh Bloody flush dangling from the roof of the mouth. No. They thought the ridges on the roof of the mouth had Pattern's sort of like a fingerprint that were passed from father to child. Complete bunk. Yeah, but imagine that example. But that wasn't fun. I don't know. Lockjaw. Anyone? Yeah. Like, how are they going to see the roof? Your mom, uh, gonna feel around or maybe do an impression test? That does not sound pleasant. What? Someone sticking their fingers in the roof of your mouth? Yeah. And feeling it seems calming to me. What? Eugenics comes next. Ah, and that is like, Hey, let's look at your let's measure your nose and ears and feel your hair and we'll determine that way If this is your father, right? And be really racist about it, right? And then a dude came along in the 19 twenties named Dr Albert Abrams and his, uh, his bunk science machine, the Oslo for Oh, nice pronunciation, Charles. Yes. So Dr Abrams not only came up with the ocelot four, I'm going to say it differently. The Acela for okay, um he came up with what the Ah Silla for measures, which makes the whole thing totally made up. But he said that if you measure blood with a nacelle off four, I'm not gonna say it either way. Um, you will get what's called the Elektronik reactions of Abram's, which is a measure of the electrical movement or electrical vibrations in blood, and that the vibrations in the blood was related to your ethnic heritage. That's right. And if you're Irish, you're gonna vibrate your blood will at 15 homes to your Jewish seven homes. Everybody knows that. And on down the line. Ah, and so this was the only thing going at the time. So judges turned to Abrams on particular. Judge named Thomas Graham in San Francisco. He hired him to determine a very high profile paternity case involving a guy named Paul Vittori, who was not given a minute. Wait a minute. I'm behalf of all listeners, Chuck, I'm sorry. That's how you're going to say Paul, Victoria Paul Vitello T thank you. And he said, I'm not gonna pay child support for my infant daughter. It's not my daughter. So they brought in Abrams to court, and they did the little blood vibration and said you are the father because your vibe, your blood is vibrating at the correct, uh, rate. And that was that. And everybody said, This is a gross miscarriage of justice. And the judges, like, what else are you gonna d'oh We can't do any like this is just a good a guess as any. But what's funny is this was in the 19 twenties, I believe, right? Yeah. Within a decade, um, there would actually be a scientific basis for testing blood to determine paternity one way or the other. And, Chuck, we're gonna talk about that right after this message. Break problems. It's human nature to hate problems. But why is that? After all, problems inspire us to mend things bend things make things better. That's why so many people work with IBM on everything from city traffic, toe, ocean, plastic, new schools to new energy flight delays to food safety. Smart loves problems. IBM. Let's put smart toe work. Visit IBM dot com slash Smart to learn more. That's a great setup, buddy. Thank you very much. So we t science finally coming into the picture. Um, and it came through with blood types. Basically, they figured out that there was such thing as blood types, which, by the way, we did a really great live show. I'm blood types. Before that was a good way. See? So, um, and my father in law shouted out that I'm pregnant. That's right. Yeah, from the from the audience. Well, we're testing my blood. Yeah, we tested blood on stage. Yeah, and got He got bigger laughs than I did the entire show. But anyway, um, the, uh the fact that blood types were proven somebody figured out that Oh, wait. You inherit your blood types from your parents so we can go pretty far away in ruling somebody in or out is the possible father of a child. Yeah, not 100% obviously or 99.99 But there are some things we know. Um, if the baby has a B blood type and you know, the mother has type a blood type than the father's gotta have either be or a B, and so they could really narrow down in a scientific way, like 100 times more than they ever could in the past. Yep. And this came, like, really to the public four. Um, which is a phrase I just made up during a Charlie Chaplin paternity case. Charlie Chaplin, the beloved Charlie Chaplin, was sued for paternity by his longtime assistant, Joan Berry. Yeah, he had a knack for ah, the young ladies and loving him and leaving him. And Joan Barry was 23 when Chaplin was 54 she said, This little baby, Caroline is Charlie's daughter, and I'm kind of tired of this pattern that he's developed of, of getting young women pregnant and then leaving them in the cold. I'm going to take him to court, and they took him to court and they use science. And they showed that he was not the father of Caroline, right? So that was it right now. Now you'd think he'd be off the hook, and that would have been the case said that had this case been tried 10 15 years later. But instead, the jury said, Well, uh, okay, he's not biologically the father, but because of his close relationship with Joan, he is Caroline's father for all intensive purposes. So we're still going to be allowed to sue him for child support. That's right of the 12 person jury. There were 11 women and one man, and they roundly said, Sorry, Charlie, right? And he just sat there silently. Yeah, that's right. And walked into a wall. Yeah, his facial expression said it all. The So, uh, I think what? With 1953 13 years later, California Law said, Ah, actually, we're not going to decide this by jury like that. If we take a scientific test and it shows that someone's not the father, then they're not the father, right? We're just going to leave it at that. And then after California passed that law, other states said, you know, it's not a bad idea altogether, so we're gonna do that, too. That's right. And then the whole thing, just like we were saying, all of it just went to the wayside when they figured out genetic testing first in the eighties. But then, by the nineties it had been developed enough, and the tests had become cheap enough that it was very much widespread and used routinely in had completely supplanted blood typing as the test for paternity. So much so, and it's gotten so cheap that Maury Povich has an ongoing thing on his Mori show, the daytime talk show where, um yeah, he routinely tests and then reveals on air the results of paternity tests for guests and, like plays it up. There's all sorts of drama, and apparently they have mugs and T shirts with the catchphrase. You are not the father emblazoned on it. What high drama. And every every day Connie Chung gets up and looks yourself in the mirror, and she's like, I've got dignity enough for the both of us. I always forget they're married. Yeah, because of things like the coffee mugs that say, You're not the father, it kind of distances the two in your mind you got POV itched. That's right. So obviously it, like you, said it got so cheap that you can get these tests now for around 15 bucks or less, which is a great deal. But then, of course, you gotta pay the lab fees. That's where they get you. With that on exactly over $100 Thio get that lab tested because you can go to your local drugstore. But that's not going to tell you anything. It's not like a pregnancy test. No, no, you still have to have it read by ah t leave reader. That's right. Um, I think that's it. Right, Chuck? Yeah. I've never taken a paternity test. Nor have I Caray. Who? Rachel, Um, if you want to know more about paternity fencing in the history of it, go check out this article by day. Bruise on how stuff works.

I hope you brushed your teeth because if not, you may have stinky breath. And this is not about stinky breath from not brushing your teeth. This is about halitosis, which is a real thing. And people that are afflicted with it can't help it. It's really kind of sad. So from April 24 2014 please listen to halitosis, colon or smell. Ever welcome to step. You should know a production of my heart radios how stuff works. Hey, welcome to the broadcast. I'm Josh card. There's Charles of you realize some people might. This might be the first episode. They listen to me. Oh, and they've already turned it off. And they're writing an iTunes review. Yeah, something's wrong with that guy. Yeah. What? What's up with Mingle? I can't believe there is so popular. Does anyone listen to him? Yeah. What's up with you? Your dough? Yeah. And how are they in the top 10? And I think that guy it must be like the ams are thing. What is that? You know where that ah people make videos where they're like stroking your hair. But it's really they're just moving their hand by the camera. They're talking like this. What really wet, Calming. But there's a subset of humans who have a central nervous re reaction. I just had one, but it's pleasurable. They call him like a brain orgasm. A m S r, I think is a S r. I think it's a M S r. I don't remember what it stands for and it's like a meditative video. Everything, I guess, to some people. Apparently, you have, like, a reaction to it, and it's very pleasurable, but it's non sexual. It's it's what when you just whisper neurological to me. I had a bad reaction, right? I can imagine. So I I don't claim to be one of those people, man. Oh, man, this is getting off to a good start, but we should do an episode on that. Sometimes people have requested it a few times. Yeah, I wantto go find out what it is. We have to go to the trouble of writing an article for Because there's not one. No, that's okay. I gotta feel those in the hopper that I'd like to do. I do too. Yeah, I just haven't been able to get around to him. We've been lazy. No, I've been busy. I said we Are you ready? Yeah. You, ah, familiar with halitosis with withholding. I've got a little intro for this. Okay, You've heard the word house host is obviously, yes. We're about to do an episode on halitosis, so I hope so. Yes. But even before this, you've heard the word halitosis. Yes. Bad breath. It's like a clinical term for bad breath, and that is true. And it always was a clinical term for bad breath. But the reason chuck, that you and I know that the word halitosis means bad breath is thanks to a nice little marketing scheme by the three guys who ran the company that made list serene back in the 19 twenties. Yeah. We talked about Dr Joseph Lister before and that list. O'Ryan was an antiseptic, surgical antiseptic. Yes, and that's it was marketed as a surgical antiseptic and then a household antiseptic. And then they said, You know what? We need to expand our market share. So let's get into other markets until he said mouthwash, we'll start telling people, Use it as mouthwash. And they made, like, their office in turn, Put some in his mouth, right? Swish it around. He died. Yeah. So they went and reformulated it a little bit at a little water, right? Ah, and then bang, boom! They had littering the mouthwash. The problem. Waas is they? They said, Well, nobody's gonna just start using a mouthwash for no good reason We have to appeal to. They're low self esteem. And that's what they did by looking through medical dictionary, finding the word halitosis and saying, That's it. Yeah, it's an age old trick in ads is to prey upon your, uh, how bad you feel about yourself on a daily basis. Yeah, and especially using medical jargon. Michelle Fu cult called it the medical gaze. Where is basically like if you add something that sounds medically to a problem that your product Can can take care of. You got gangbusters right there. Yeah. And it was an archaic term Latin term that had gone away completely. Yeah, it comes from the Latin Halliday us for breath and the Greek suffix. Oh, sis, which is used to indicate abnormality or a disease state. Yeah, but prehistory and people weren't walking around saying the word halitosis. It had gone. The way of the dodo was a word. No, and even still, it was kind of like people weren't really doing a lot to take care of their breath. Anyway, it wasn't a thing until this group from the list Oring company said we're gonna make it a thing. And we're gonna make using mouthwash to combat this thing a thing. And they did. Within a decade, it was just basically like, That's what you did use mouthwash every morning yet And they I thought it was pretty funny. And where'd you get that? Cracked? Yeah, Cracked? Yeah, it was a great article. And they said they went on to use other words in advertising later on, like home Ato Sis, which is you didn't have a tractor furniture and ah bro modo sis if you had smelly feet. Yeah, and I don't think that they didn't catch on as well. Not like halitosis. For some reason, halitosis did catch on, and as a result, there are people out there who have hallowed a phobia. Yeah, I'm one of them. Oh, yeah, not dot like I don't need to see a shrink, but, um, my first girlfriend had halitosis. Yeah, and I think I can say that because I don't think she listens. And I don't think she knows she was my first girlfriend. Okay, Like, I never said you're my first girlfriend, right? But yeah, she had bad. And I say halitosis. Ah, to me, there's a difference between everyone gets bad breath occasionally. Right. But there's a certain tang that's very identifiable that I call halitosis. She had it. And I you know, I felt like I had to kiss her. And stuff was my first girlfriend. I had to learn how to do that. Junkie, huh? Yeah, man. And it was I have ah dreams to this day. Halitosis kissing dreams. Do you really? I like we'll see some, like, gorgeous girl in my dream and go to kiss her and she has, like, this awful rotten breath like it's a recurring dream. So I guess I have Helena phobia. I'm very aware of it in it. That's why I have a tongue scraper and all that junk. Well, apparently, that's one way to treat. Yeah. Oh, we're getting ahead of ourselves. So, boiler and I I should say I have had a mild case of Helena phobia. It may or may not have been warranted. I don't know. I have my own microphone cover for that reason. I know, but it's not because you're protecting other people from your halitosis, right? You don't want your nose in other people's stuff, right? Yes. Okay. Because the microphone cover at one point smelled really bad, and I got revolted, and I ordered one the next day. Right? So how Helena phobia refers to your fear of your bad breath? You fearing others? Yeah. Yeah, that's a different thing then. Okay. Yeah. No, I was worried. I have bad breath, I guess. Part of me, like I have that concern because of other people's bad breath about myself, too. Though I think that's why I'm, like, manic about brushing my tongue. Oh, yeah. That's where I really got it. I sat next to a movie. I sat next to some dude in a movie theater once and like he was facing forward, Uh, I was facing forward, and I almost couldn't sit next to him the whole time. Yes, it was that bad. You should have moved. I don't know why I didn't. Yeah, that's become my ghost. Self punishing, I guess. No, I used to do that like it concerts. I always said that I would just always 100 time be next to the most obnoxious drunk, right? And it used to just bother me and get under my skin. But then I was like, You know what? I'm just gonna start moving. Yeah, this didn't make me like I wasn't mad at the guy. Felt horrible for him, Almost to the point where, like, i I was going to get in my car and follow him home. And then, like after he got into his house, I was going to come in after and then sit him down, and then maybe we have like, um, some milk or something. Sure. Give him all calm down, let him sleep, and then when he woke up the next morning, I'd still be sitting at his kitchen table and then I would say to him, Ah, I have something to tell you. And then I would say you have really bad breath, man. And he'd say, No crap, dude, I have a condition. Well, that's why you don't necessarily want to say anything to anybody. Because they may. Yeah. So let's get down to this. Garlic onions, thes air. The things that people frequently associate. How its hostess with. Yeah, which is a bunch of B s. Well, no, I mean, like, it can give you bad breath. Yeah, but that to me, that's the temporary bad breath that one gets just from food. Yeah, And the reason why you do get bad breath from say, like onions in particular is because our garlic I'm sorry. Garlic contains something called Alison, which in the stomach is converted to l l'm Ethel Sulfide, which is not metabolized and which comes back up is gas from your gut. So when you have bad breath from onions, it's not onion particles in your mouth. Still, that's gas leaking out of your gut into your mouth and just kind of stick in there for a couple hours. Do you ever take garlic bills? Ah, yeah, it's weird. They Yeah, I'd just rather eat garlic any day of the week. Yeah. I mean, I eat tons of garlic. I love it, but I have taken garlic pills in the past year and there, and I will forget that I've taken one, and then you burp up like that. I have lasagna. Not for breakfast, but it doesn't taste like good garlic. It tastes awful. It is medicinal. Garlic I didn't find I mean, the pill didn't taste like anything but my burps. Definitely. Right, garlicky. Let's see if it was for me. I always just thought it was different things to different. Yeah, I'd just rather, like, cut the top off of a whole bulb of garlic. Yeah, put some olive oil on it and wrap it in foil. Or put it in your clay. Garlic baker. Yeah. And put it in the oven for a little while and chow down, baby. Yeah, just squeeze those things right into your mouth. Yeah, it's a little good. Yeah, and so good for you. We're in sync today. Ah, So you say your bed is that you don't Your garlic and onions don't count to you. Well, halitosis. No, I think they're there is bad breath. You can just have because maybe forgot to brush or obviously, morning breath, which will get to And then I think some people, unfortunately, are have a constant state of this very specific bad breath. Yeah. So I think one in four people I have actual halitosis, right? That seems a little high, but maybe people are just doing a good job of masking it. Maybe so, but some people aren't. So, um, what it comes down to ultimately, Chuck? Yeah. Halitosis is a simple as the bacteria in our mouth. Yeah, the fact that we have bacteria, it's the same thing is our armpits. Why they smell bacteria breaking down stuff from our bodies beneficially into stinky little gases. Yeah, and giving off little bacteria. Toots. Yeah, Yeah, the ah, the average person has 800 types of bacteria in the mouth, and, um, they don't need like, it's good thing they don't tell kids stuff like this growing up in school because French kissing probably wouldn't happen, you know. Well, well, then Maybe they should tell kids in school that, but it's really kind of disgusting thing. Like you don't see people looking armpits. Some people by Ben Stiller. Yeah. What was that in? Was it Ben Stiller who was into it? No, I saw her was in a movie, right? Yeah, I've seen that flirting with disaster. Ben Stiller flirting with his ass. But I can't remember if it was Ben Stiller who was into it. Or if it was Josh Brolin was into, Ah, Patricia Arquette's armpits. That's right. Okay. Yeah. And Patricia Arquette was married to Ben Stiller. Yeah, and she let him look her armpit. This weird movie that was I love that movie. You can't catch the wind. Remember that part? Yeah. Um, all right. Back to the mouth and how disgusting it is. They say if you magnify just a single cell on the surface of that tongue, you would see about 100 types of bacteria, right? Just on that cell. So this this bacteria, when you eat and you swallow food after masticated it, which isn't dirty, it means choo. Yeah. Ah, you leave little particles in your mouth. It gets stuck in your teeth. Maybe if, like you have, ah, beginning periodontal disease and might get stuck in your gums along your teeth a little bit, Yeah, the very least, it's going to get stuck to the back of your tongue, and it just kind of sits there, and the bacteria in your mouth love this stuff. It's food to them. They break it down into particles and particles and like, this is pretty good. But I can't get the energy from it fully. So I'm gonna break down the amino acids even further in them. Bam! When I do, I'm going to basically emit sulfur sulfuric gases. Yeah, and that's where bad breath comes from their sulfuric gases that air again, a byproduct of the, uh, bacteria eating the food particles in your mouth. Yeah, leftover proteins. Yeah, and it's, um, the mouth is a you know, it's a great breeding ground for it because it's clammy and warm, and it's just got everything that the bacteria loves to produce those stinky, stinky smells. Um, but dry mouth can also cause halitosis, because that's what you get overnight. And when you have stinky morning breath, right, because your saliva production decreases when you sleep. Otherwise you'd just be a drooling Max. Um, I wonder why that doesn't work during naps on your school desk? I don't know. You know, I guess because you don't go to sleep enough. Maybe. Or if, like, your face is pressed against wood, it's a signal of your body to increase live a productive wake up. The teacher's coming. All right. Ah, but chronic dry mouth is something that can affect people during the daytime as well. It's called zero Stone Mia. And, um, if you have your stomach, you're gonna have a harder time fighting your bad breath because your mouth is always dry, like the mouth. The saliva just acts as a natural mouthwash. Right? Exactly. Now only rinses away. Like food particles that runs his way. Bacteria. It rinses away the dead skin cells and dead mouth cells that the bacteria also eat. Um and yeah, the dryer. It is, the less that action takes place. Yeah, And you got stinky breath. Yeah. So if you're on Anna histamines or, um, antidepressants or painkillers? Ah, dry mouth is a side effect of some of those drugs, so you might have a harder time. Ah, And if you're sick anyway, you're gonna stink your breath to, like, If you're fighting a Sinus infection, let's say, uh, it's gross. Yes, cheeky breath. Because that mucus trickles back from your Sinuses down to your tongue and sits there. Yeah, and gets eaten up to nasty stuff, his neck, this whole thing. I'm just cringing I'm gonna have on those dreams tonight. There's you could a stinky halitosis breath dream. Yes, the hot girl. Bad breath. It's always the same. Does Emily know you're having dreams about kissing hot girls with bed breath? Yeah, she thinks it's funny. She thinks it's because of my, uh, ah, repressed religious upbringing. Repressed sexuality like I won't even in my dreams allow myself to kiss the model. That's hilarious. Like she'll have ah, call it vomit tongue. It's so gross. Oh, yeah, that is pretty bad. Yeah, they're the worst dreams. I can't explain to you because they're really headed in the right direction and, you know, and it's terrible. And when you're old Mary, man, that's all you got. I got, you know, vomit tongue. No, just you know your dreams. You can't be. I know it's me. I'm just can't be assaulted for having a dream. I guess I could, but that's not a very nice wife. Give me my dream time. All right? I'm going to sleep. I'm down a slippery slope right now. Let's pull out with the Cato acidosis, man. Okay, So, Chuck, when you have, um, when you eat onions, when you have garlic wine and food particles, all the stuff, that's normal. Bad breath stuff. There's also other things. Metabolic things Often that can give you, like a a different type of breath that may or may not be bad. One bad one is if you have liver problems. Yeah, your liver's shutting down. You're gonna have what's called mousey breath. Can you imagine what mousey breath smells like now? Like, apparently, where the breath smells like live riding mice. Interesting mousey breath. I can't think of what else it would do. No, I don't know what a mouth smells like. Uh, sure. I mean, have you ever smelled like a rodent cage? Yeah, but they smell like cedar and poop. Is that what it smells like? This'd mean a cedar. Ah. So is ketoacidosis the, um the no carb effect? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That is something that will warn you about if you are trying to attain what's known as ketosis with, like, an Atkins type diet. Um, some people, when there are reached that blissful level of fat burning, it also takes its toll on their mouth and their breath. Yeah, it's like a fruity acid Tony smell. Okay, that sounds better than mousey. Yes, bets can be placed in the mouth. Yeah. Yeah. When you're in key Tose issue when you deprive your body of carbohydrates Yeah, it doesn't have the energy to burn right there. So it starts turning inward and going after your fat stores. And when the body burns, store fat key tones are what is released his energy or burned his energy thinking. Keep them. And this yet, the smell from earning key tones is what gives you that fruity breath. Yeah, I've seen websites, You know that they now have the articles. Of course, if you're if this is the diet you want, this is how you can help yourself and one of the tips us always eat bread. It's like, yeah, but that all of a sudden you're not on that diet. Yeah, So that's no solution. You can get knocked out. A key toast is pretty easy, I'm sure. Yeah, I think eating bread would do it, you know, chuck out. Some people are like, Oh, the holidays come earlier and earlier every year, like it's some sort of problem. Yeah, well, I would tell those people, chuck, that they need to try Make Cafe's new seasonal treats because they're going to get them in the holiday spirit. Right quick. That's right, man. We're talking warm, flaky donut sticks made fresh every morning sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. They are back, everybody, and now a new chocolate dipping sauce comes along with it. Delicious. Yeah, plus, let's just talk about the new cinnamon cookie lot. That's right. It's made with cinnamon sugar syrup, hand stirred with milk and rich, freshly brewed espresso man. And then it stopped off with a Sprinkle of cinnamon. Yeah, it tastes like the holidays, and it's gonna put you in the holiday spirit. Warm up to the holidays with donuts sticks, now a chocolate sauce, and the new cinnamon cookie lot on Lee from McCafe Good is brewing for a limited time, only participating McDonald's. So let's say you are Sadly, just one of those people that just has that funky breath. One in four, right? Yeah. If you're among that 25% it does seem high. Yeah. Didn't that's like chronic halitosis, right? Yeah. Where? It's not just like, you know, brushing your teeth isn't gonna do right. The trick. Yeah. 25%. Yeah, that sounds like a fact brought to us by the list. Serene company and my fee. But like I said, maybe, um, 15% of those people are really trying their hardest. So you don't notice it and get you and other people were just smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee. OK, Which is a bad combination. Yeah, it's pretty bad. Combination does. Somehow they become greater than the sum of their parts. Yeah, you know. Yeah, but that's Ah, that's breakfast for college students, you know? Sure. Coffee and cigarettes. So what do you do if you're if you're gonna battle this stuff? If it's more than just something like just breath mint can handle what's gonna happen here? Well, the breath mint. It's a good thing to mention that that can provide a little temporary relief, but it's just masking the funk underneath, right? So you really not gonna get very far as a solution? No, because always doing is creating the sensation of freshness in your mouth. Yeah, because it I don't know what breath mints do have off frequently. Wondered like, what is like, um um, Menthol do? Yeah. Does it open up your pores. So, like, the air feels colder and fresher. Oh, no. Like, what creates that sensation? You don't know? Yeah, it was like it. Don't be dumb episode to me, but I think it might be, Um, what you want to do is get to the root of the problem, which is that bacteria. And like we said, food particles in your teeth, um, is a big cause. So brushing and flossing in the old tongue scraper and brushing the back of the tongue You scrape the time. Oh, yeah. Doesn't it make you gag now? It doesn't bother me, huh? I've gotten used to it. I mean, you know, occasionally if I overreach, that might be a little, but I'm not like retching in the bathroom every morning. I think we should keep a webcam in your bathroom when you're getting ready just to catch those times that you do? Yeah, way. Just make a couple of Ayn compilation v Hillary eso attacking the source of the food particles. And, you know, I have the fake tooth now, so I have to be extra careful to really brush along there, because what I think it would be like they've made it out of some new super polymer That, like, reflects bacteria, is now that the tooth itself is is not the source. But it's, um you know where it meets. The gum is not a natural tooth. So yeah, I just have to, like, really brushed the crap out of that area. My God, get the craft out. I don't use mouthwash. That which is interesting. Yeah. Now, just toothpaste. Well, apparently, um, it's not necessarily. And plenty of mouthwash is a suggestion for this. Specifically, types that contain, according to British medical journal chloral hex, a dream gluconate, flora hex, a dream gluconate or what you want because they kill bacteria. I take issue with this. Yeah, One of the main functions of mouthwash isn't to just go in and kill bacteria, although most mouthwashes do that. Yeah. Um, it's the swishing action loosens food particles and gets him out from in between your teeth. So you should know before you brush. What I'm saying is you don't necessarily need to use a mouthwash that kills bacteria because you kind of want healthy bacteria. Sure you want what's called a, um Ah, an aural ecosystem. Then you're a Christian healthy aural ecosystem. Where ecology in your mouth. Uh, you want remember? Remember the poop shake episode? The poop transplant Fecal transplant episode? Yeah. Wait. We ended up talking about the microbiome. Yeah, and how important it is to humanity. Teacher. Same thing with our mouth. Yeah. You want to kill all the bacteria? No. And there's plenty of bacteria that causes problems like strip to caucus mutations is what gives us cavities. Yeah, but there's also plenty of beneficial bacteria where you would have a mouthful of dead skin cells all over your tongue if it weren't for this helpful bacteria break in this stuff down. What's your problem? Everybody wanted to kill bacteria. Yeah, that's not necessarily a good thing. As a matter of fact, I think we're learning more and more that it's not a good thing. So I say avoid the mouthwash that kills bacteria and just use some sort of mouthwash that maybe has a minty flavor. But it's just really just swishing the food particles out and getting rid of the bacteria's food that's creating their stinky sulfur ducks. Yes, exactly, Um, and because getting rid of the food is a big part of it. Ah, I would suggest brushing your teeth after lunch, too, you know, like, don't make it just when you get up before you go to bed. I say go for three times a day. Whoa, man, who has time for that? Everybody. Another good trick is to drink a lot of water. Um, but, you know, just keeping your mouth hydrated daily basis didn't help. You said that saliva is like a natural mouthwash. Water helps. It does the same thing. Loosens food particles, gets rid of dead skin cells in the back. Your tongue apparently is like ground zero for Yeah, like I think there's, like, 20 times more bacteria. They're than elsewhere, because it's like this bumpy surface that's out of the way of all this other stuff. Yeah. So things really stick and accumulate back there? Yeah, that's the That's an area you want to target, apparently with the tongue scraper. Yeah, and you could just brush it as well. I do both. But if you are a grown adult and you're not either brushing your tongue or using a tongue scraper than you're not doing it right, it's alright. Yes. Somebody needs to teach you. I give a part of it, you know, brushes with my toothbrush over my tongue. But I worry about killing taste buds. Like I love tasting things. You're not gonna kill any taste, but it's sure you can kill taste buds with them. Uh, well, I haven't killed any. Are you sure? Think about what kind of a super taster you could be without your eggs. You know, I do worry about that. I'm kind of like I'd rather have low level bad breath and be able to taste great stuff, then have no bad breath whatsoever and not be able to taste. I would rather have no bad breath and still taste everything. Well, yeah, that's the Holy Grail. What kind of like flim flam world? Are you living it? It's called Chuck's Life. It's nice. It's nice if none of this stuff works for you. You may have a problem. Like you might want to go see a dentist. Ah, and maybe even a doctor. Well, yeah. The dentist might say go, Doctor. Yeah, I go. The doctor can see you. Uh, you have a mousey breath, which means your liver's shutting down and find a new dentist. You know, there's a smell test that they do that dentists do. Really? Yeah. What they'll do is still say, Okay, this is gonna be gross, but I want you to breathe through your mouth, and I'm going to sniff close to your mouth. Wow. And then they say, Okay, now, I want you to breathe through your nose, and I'm gonna sniff close to your nose, and they can determine whether it's a nasal in, like a problem in your nasal cavity. I can give you bad breath. You can have stinking nasal Sinuses. So gross, uh, or if it's in your mouth, and then they can further deduce like, Yeah, this is not a dentist doing this. Yeah, And if it's in your if it's coming through your nose, it suggests possibly not just your Sinuses, but it could be pulmonary to like you could have some sort of lung problem that's creating gases that stink and her coming out of your nose rather than your mouth. So I guess they train you to do that in dental school, huh? I guess I like. I'd have to. That's not very popular day. You know, Everybody pair up. That's the one guy in the corner like eating a sandwich. Yeah, like what problems? It's human nature to hate problems. But why is that? After all, problems inspire us to mend things bend things make things better. That's why so many people work with IBM on everything from city traffic toe ocean plastic, new schools to new energy flight delays to food safety. Smart loves problems. IBM. Let's put smart toe work. Visit IBM dot com slash smart to learn more. Can I give ah two more tips? Yeah. Please get 10 more if you eat a crunchy breakfast like granola cereal or something like that. Okay. It's gonna clear out a lot of the gunk from the night before, huh? Do you just want to make sure you get rid of all those food particles afterwards, Okay. And then if you're interested in a mouthwash. That is not anti bacterial. Really. Certainly remembering your own now. Ah, you take 1/2 a cup of warm water, an eighth of a teaspoon of sentiment and one teaspoon of honey swirl altogether and ah, swish it around and gargle it. That's like, um, like old timey mouthwash. Apparently. Yeah. And we could probably recommend apple cider vinegar just for anything that's like the wonder, uh, the wonder. Ah, liquid. It seemed like dude, I was once on my way to a full blown kidney. Or, um, I may be urinary, your urinary and oh, yeah, some blighter infected something that was going on, and it was starting to go downhill fast. And you muse, like, drink this and drink a lot of it. Yeah, And I started drinking apple cider vinegar and, like, raw cranberry, just like the real cranberry juice, huh? Um, over, like, about an 8 to 12 hour period. Like, really hit it and, um, gone? Yeah, in like it was happening. The happening was going on. And like I thwarted, he stopped the happening. I do a shot every morning now of ah, apple cider Vinegar. Vinegar. Yeah, And don't get the just this stuff in the store that you should be cooking and cleaning with. There's the can't remember the brand, but there's the super potable one. The really IQ. Yeah, the one that you'll find in a health food store. Yeah, I can't remember the name of it, but there's, like one brand that everyone goes to write, and it's It's tough, man. If you ever just do a straight shot of it without diluting it, it's hard core. Yeah, everything I was doing was taking maybe a shot and then diluting in, like, eight ounces of water. And it'll feel very difficult. Yeah, you can do it, though. Especially when you're fighting off some sort of infection. Yeah, and you want to brush your teeth after that because it smells. Curtis, just brush your teeth all the time. Yeah. Ah, if you want to learn more about halitosis, I don't know what more you could possibly learn, but you could try. You could type that word into the search bar howstuffworks dot com and will bring up this article. And since I said search bar, it's time for a listener, man, we're gonna dress our April Fool's prank officially here with this one? Um, I want to say, first of all, Josh, you and Ben I was blown away by the performance. Thank you. You guys sold it so hard. Like, and we just threw it together. We're like, Hey, let's just try it wasn't some big plot. We There's no practice planned for weeks and weeks. Okay, Maybe we should do an April fool's joke this year. And I said, Hey, maybe I quit the show and been took my place. And you guys just winged it in like, nailed it, man. I was sitting here beside you, and I felt like I was watching my own funeral. Yeah. No. Weird. Yeah, you kept going. Cut. Stop, stop. We're like, No, we have to press on. So we're not jokesters typically, but it was I think it was our only one to be released on April. Fool's Day was the first time we had the opportunity to release one on April fools and look out two years from now because that'll be apparently, yeah, yeah, but if we do like Josh left, the shelter would be like, No, no, no. Or they'll be expecting that. Oh, yeah, and we'll do it and they'll be like, Well, wait a minute. They thought that I would think that, you know, maybe we could go if you like. I don't know, we could have a heart attack on the show or something. But anyway, we got an outpouring of people because I was dead or missing. I know people really, really reacted that, like, a lot of people said they didn't realize how much they needed you until we're gone. Yeah, there were plenty of people. He said, like Josh. If it had been, you felt the same way. But, um well, I got to play the martyr. I got the plum role. It was nice. Like I had to do nothing and just get showered with adulation. But it was It was very neat to see, like people like never leave. Don't ever do that again. It was pretty cool, actually. Yeah. And also, I want to say, on behalf of Ben, he asked us to let everybody know whenever we could that he actually was purposely sounding terrible, See what he was doing. He like, that was play acting. Yeah. Yeah. The whole point was like we wanted it to be super awkward, right? I think you can achieve that. Okay, so So go ahead. Back on the dead, Chuck. So this Fermat from Athens, Georgia, go dogs. Hey, guys. My girlfriend. I've been listening for years. I didn't realize just how important the show was to us, though, until your April Fool's Day Show. I'd listen to the episode before she did, and he didn't even tell her. That's kind of mean. And I was keen on setting her up for the gag. So I sat it out in the kitchen table and told her that, uh, stuff you should know that some big news. I knew she'd be sucked into the prank but was not prepared for what happened next. She started to cry and denounced the show with one of you gone saying she would stop listening. She was worried about Chuck. I even had people are worried about Emily. They felt like they thought Emily was in the hospital. It's awesome. Uh, Chuck started. She said she would stop listening and was worried about Chuck and started tossing out possible explanations. Like the best of conspiracy theorists. She was so sad that I had to fast forward to the reveal, uh, after her surprising yet pretty cute reaction. I was hoping to swap out her emotional connection for a birthday. Shout out she's a contemporary dancer and uses the ideas in your podcast and her classes and choreography think dance is about Alan Turing. I got to see this. Yeah, it's crazy, I admit, this pretty crass way of getting Happy Birthday, but I think it's worth a shot. So, Matt, uh, you didn't tell us your girlfriend's name, So we're just going to say Happy Birthday to Matt's girlfriend from Athens. Happy birthday. Matt's girlfriend. I'm gonna get to Jennifer. Matt. Enjoy sleeping on the couch this evening. You know, we fooled some of our friends. Even Joe Randazzo texted me and said you guys actually fooled me for about eight seconds. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. We got a lot of people who said like, I didn't fall for anything all day. Yeah, and the only people who got me to stuff you should know because you guys, like, destroyed it. And then the one with me for a minute, I thought I was on the show after leave the ones that I felt bad about, though. We're the ones who listened to it like after April 1st. Yeah. Yeah. And we're like Australia. Yeah, they didn't realize it was the It was. Yeah, exactly. But yes. So, everyone, thank you very much for the outpouring of emotion. We both feel very loved. Yeah, sure. I mean, we no people like show. But when you hear stuff like that, it's like, Yeah, kind of depend on this. And, uh, we know now that we're not allowed to ever leave now it's go out in a murder suicide if anything. Okay, cool. Agreed.

Happy Halloween. Uh, we just wanted to give you guys a heads up that Jerry went all out with this Halloween episode, and there is a moment of surprisingly graphic violence. His brief and it's quick, but we just wanted to give a heads up to all the people who are sensitive to violence and all the parents, at any rate, on with the show. Welcome to stuff you should know. A production of I heart radios. How stuff works blue and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Spooktacular Bryant E think I would have had something better than that. And there's Jerry over there Spooky all year round. So nothing. Nothing different here. Nothing different. How you doing? I'm great. I'm ready to go get our Halloween read on. It's exciting. This is how many years in a row. Oh, man, I don't know. I think it goes back to something like 2010. Maybe. I think so. Sure. And ah, we don't want to pat ourselves on the back too much, but we have made great efforts, everyone to keep the Halloween and Christmas episodes ad free at great peril, you know? Yeah. It's kind of like a constant clashing of swords against their shields and saying back, back, Huskies, And we've done a good job with it so far. That's right. So were you won't hear any ads on this episode because that really kills the buzz of the mood. You will hear Those are we're doing a shorty Halloween reading. In fact, I think that came out just prior to this one, and ah, we didn't fight that battle. So sorry about that. Yeah, hopefully there was a nice little warm up for this one, though. Yeah, just get you primed. And this year, Chuck, we're doing one by an amazing author who hasn't been dead for 150 years. Philip K Dick. That's right. Who wrote do Androids dream of electric sheep, which became Blade Runner trying to, um, a scanner darkly. All sorts of amazing stuff, right? Uh, minority report, I think. And this one. He also wrote a bunch of short stories, and this one I found was like in the public domain. So I said, let's do Philip K dick. That's right. He said, heck yes. Let's do Philip K. dick Because we don't want to get sued by the Dick Foundation. No. So we wanted to make sure that everyone knows this is public domain. Is that correct? So Ah, do you want to get started? Uh, yeah. Who's Ah, we haven't discussed order. Anything usually free, will it? Do you have anything segmented out or you just wanna knock me over the head when I've gotten too far? I think we'll be able to tell. And if not, you know, we'll just edit out the roughness about that. Who's gonna start? Ah, I'll start. Right? Sure. Okay. You ready? I like this story. By the way. I love it. It's good. By the way, this is the hanging stranger by Philip K. Dick. Five o'clock head lice washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car out and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His back and shoulders ache from digging dirt out of the basement and wheeling it into the backyard. But for a 40 year old man, he had done okay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he saved. And he liked the idea of repairing the foundation's himself. It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scary and commuters tired and grim faced women loaded down with bundles and packages students swarming home from the university. Mixing with clerks and businessmen and drab secretaries, he stopped his Packard for a red light and then started it up again. The store had been open without him. He'd arrived just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the records of the day, maybe even closed a couple of sales himself. He drove slowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the town park. There were no parking places in front of Loy's TV sales and service. He cursed under his breath and swing the car in a U turn. Again, he passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain and bench and single lamp post from the lamppost. Something was hanging a shapeless dark bundle swinging a little with the wind like a dummy of some sort. Loy's rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it a display of some kind. Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square again. He made a U turn and brought his car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a display, it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck Rose and he swallowed uneasily. Sweats laid out on his face and hands. He was a body. A human body. Yeah. I mean, that's you, buddy. All right, So, TV salesman, I'm really glad his wife is gonna be able to buy that new vase. Sure. I thought that was a weird detail, too, because he's digging out the foundation of his house, which I think is Ah, a red herring. We'll find out if we'll find out. Look at it. Lloyd snapped. Come on out here. Don Ferguson came slowly out of the store buttoning his pin striped coat with dignity. This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy standing there. See it? Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jetted up against the sky. The post in the bundle, swinging from it. There it is. How the hell long has it been there? His voice rose excitedly. What's wrong with everybody. They just walk on past Don Ferguson lit a cigarette slowly. Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there a reason. What kind of a reason? Ferguson shrugged. Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick. There, some sort of civic thing. How would I know? Cheese. Ferguson's uptight? Yeah, a little uptight, Sir. Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. What's up, boys? There's a body hanging from the lamppost, Loy said. I'm going to call the cops and they must know about it, Potter said. Or otherwise it wouldn't be there. I got to get back in. Ferguson headed back into the store business before pleasure lawyers began to get hysterical. You see it, you see it hanging there, a man's body, a dead man. Sure, Ed I saw this afternoon when I went out for coffee. You mean it's been there all afternoon? Sure. What's the matter? Potter glanced at his watch. Have to run. See you later. Ed Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the sidewalk. Men and women passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundle and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any attention. Very good check. That was really good. Yeah. Apparently no one is concerned about this person hanging there. But Ed Loy's. This is a little weird, if you think about it, Theo, I'm going nuts, voice whispered. He made his way to the curb and crossed out into traffic among the cars. Horns honked angrily, Adam. He gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green. The man had been middle aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray suit splashed in, caked with dried mud. A stranger voice had never seen him before, not a local man. His face was partly turned away, and in the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin was gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A pair of steel rimmed glasses hung from one year dangling foolishly, his eyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue, for heaven's sake. Lawyers murdered, sickened. He pushed down, is nausea and made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over with revulsion and fear Why? Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean? And I didn't anybody notice? He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. Watch it! The main greeted. Oh, it's you, Ed Ed nodded. Days Adlai. Hello, Jenkins. What's the matter? The stationary clerk called Ed's arm. You look sick. The body there in the park. Sure, Ed Jenkins let him into the alcove of Lloyd's TV sales and service. Take it easy. Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. Something wrong? Ed's not feeling well. Lawyers yanked himself free. How can you stay in here? Don't you see it? For God's sake? What's he talking about? Margaret asked nervously the body and shouted The body hanging there. More people collected. Is he sick? Is Ed Loy's you okay? Yet the body lawyers screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at him. He tore loose. Let me go! The police get the police, ed. Better get a doctor. He must be sick or drunk. Lawyers fought his way through the people. He stumbled in. Half fell through a blur. He saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious men and women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them toward a store. He could see Ferguson inside, talking to a man showing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back of the service counter, setting up a new Philco. Lawyers shouted at them frantically. His voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmuring around him. Do something, he screamed. Don't stand there! Do something! Something's wrong. Something's happened. Things were going on. The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavyset cops moving efficiently toward voice. Man, no one's listening to Eloise. He's also losing his bananas. Yeah, as they say, I think I would have handled it a little differently. But what would you have done? And I'm like, I'm not judging it Voice. Okay. All right. All right. So the cops are approaching here. Here we go. Name the cop with the notebook. Murmured lice. He mopped his head wearily. Edward Seed Loy ce listen to me back there. Address the cop demanded the police car moves swiftly through traffic shooting among the cars and buses. Lloyd's sagged against the seat. Exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuttering breath. 13 68 Hearst road that's here in Pikeville. That's right. Lawyers pulled himself up with a violent effort. Listen to me back there in the square, hanging from the lamppost. Where were you today? The cop behind the wheel demanded. Where Loy's echoed, You weren't in your shop where, you know, he shook his head. No, I was a home down in the basement, in the basement, fig ing a new foundation, getting out the dirt to poor submit frame. Why, what has this got to do with? Was anybody else down there with you? No, my wife was downtown. My kids were at school. Voice looked from one heavyset copped to the other. Hope flickered across his face. Wild hope, you mean because I was down there? I missed the explanation. I didn't get in on it like everybody else. After a pause, the cop with the notebook said, That's right. You miss the explanation. Then it's official. The body is supposed to be hanging there. It's supposed to be hanging there for everybody to see Ed Loy's Grand Weekly Could Lord, I guess I sort of went off the deep end. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like the Ku Klux Klan, some kind of violence, communist or fascist. Taking over, he wiped his face with his breast pocket handkerchief, his hands shaking. I'm glad to know it's on the level. It's on the level the police car was getting near the Hall of Justice the sun had set. The streets were gloomy in dark. The lights had not yet. Come on. I feel better, Loy said. I was pretty excited there for a minute. I guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to take me in. Is there? The two cops said nothing very nice. Ready? Yeah, it's eating up. I know I've You're a tough act to follow, but here I go. E. I should be back in my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all right now. No more trouble. Is there any need of this? Won't take long. The cop behind the wheel interrupted a short process on Lee a few minutes. I hope it's short. Lewis murdered the car, slowed down for a stoplight. I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny getting excited like that. And lice yank the door open and he's fall out into the street and rolled to his feet. Cars were moving all around and gaining speed of light. Voice leapt onto the curb and raced among the people borrowing into the swarming crowd. Behind him, he heard sounds, shouts, people running. They weren't cops. He'd realize that right away he knew every cop in Pikeville. A man could known a store operate a business in a small town for 25 years without getting to know all the cops. They weren't cops, and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter, Ferguson, Jenkins. None of them knew why it was there. They didn't know and they didn't care. That was the strange part. Lloyd's ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the startled clerks and customers into the shipping room and through the back door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete steps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side, gasping, panting. There was no sound behind him. He had gotten away. I think it's back to you, man. All right, so he made a run for it. He did, and now he's kind of safe for the moment. For the moment, he was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and ruined boxes and tires. You could see the street at the far end. A streetlight wavered and came on men and women stores, neon signs, cars and to his right, the police station. He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery store rose. The white concrete side of the Hall of Justice barred windows. The police antenna, a great concrete wall rising up in the darkness, a bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to keep moving. Get farther away from them. Them voice move cautiously. Down the alley beyond the police station was the city hall, the old fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass and broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark windows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance and something else above. The city hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than the surrounding night, a prism of black that spread out and was lost into the sky. Weird. I know very weird. He listened. Good God. He could hear something, something that made him struggle frantically to close his ears, his mind to shut out, the sound of a buzzing, a distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees. The boy things are getting bad. It is whenever you see a cone of gloom denser than the surrounding night, that's not a good sign. All right, go ahead. Loy's gazed up rigid with horror, the splotch of darkness hanging over City Hall darkness so thick it seemed almost solid. In the vortex. Something moved, flickering shapes, things descending from the sky, pausing momentarily above the city hall, fluttering over in a dense swarm and then dropping silently onto the roof shapes, fluttering shapes from the sky from the crack of darkness that hung above him. He was seeing them for a long time. Louis watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool of scummy water. They were landing, coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the city hall and disappearing Inside. They had wings like giant insects of some kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest and then crawled crab fashion sideways across the roof and into the building. He was sickened and fascinated. Cold Night wind blew around him, and he shuddered. He was tired days with shock on the front steps of the city hall. Were men standing here and their groups of men coming out of the building and halting for a moment before going on with arm or of them? It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm weren't men. They were alien from some other world, some other dimension sliding through the slit, this break in the shell of the universe. Entering through this gap winged insects from another realm of being. That's me hitting the tennis ball back to you. This is Ah, is getting pretty scary. I think so, too. I mean, now we've got winged insect aliens coming from a chasm in the sky on to City Hall. Or do we just have a man losing his mind? That's a really good question, Chuck. Let's explore that further. On the steps of the City hall, a group of men broke up. A few move toward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re enter the city hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others. Loy's closed. His eyes and horror senses reeled. He hung on tight, clutching at the sagging fence, the shape the man shape had abruptly flooded up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and came to rest, among them pseudo men, imitation men, insects with ability to disguise themselves as men. Like other insects familiar to earth. Protective coloration Mimic re Loy's pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The alley was totally dark, but maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe darkness made no difference to them. He had left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and women float past, but not so many. Now, at the bus stop, stood waiting groups, a huge bus lumbering along the street. It's lights flashing in the evening gloom. Lawyers moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting, and when the bus halted, he boarded it and took a seat in the rear by the door. A moment later, the bus moved into life and rumble down the street. Voice relaxed a little. He studied the people around him, dulled tired faces, people going home from work, quite ordinary faces. None of them paid any attention to him. All sat quietly, sunk down in their seats, jiggling with the motion of the bus. The man sitting next to him unfolded a newspaper. He began to read the sports section, his lips moving. An ordinary man blue suit tie a businessman or a salesman on his way home to his wife and family. Across the aisle, a young woman, perhaps 20 dark eyes and hair, a package on her lap. Nylons and heels, red coat and white angora sweater, gazing absently ahead of her high school boy in jeans and black jacket. A great triple chin woman with an immense shopping bag loaded with packages and parcels. Her face dim with weariness. Ordinary people, the kind that rode the bus every evening, going home to their families to dinner. Huh? Well, you can make riding the bus home to dinner. Sounds sinister. Check eggs. Nice work. Going home with their minds, dead controlled, filmed over with the mask of an alien being that it appeared and taken possession of them. Their town, their lives himself, too. Except that he had happened to be deep in his cellar instead of in the store. Somehow he had been overlooked. They had missed him. Their control wasn't perfect. Foolproof. Maybe there were others. Hope Flickered and Loy ce. They were an omnipotent. They had made a mistake, not gotten control of him. Their net, their field of control had passed over him. He had emerged from his cellar is he had gone down. Apparently their power zone was limited. A few seats down, the Isle of Man was watching him. Loy's broke off his chain of thought, a slender man with dark hair in a small moustache. Well dressed, brown suit, shiny shoes. A book between his small hands. He was watching Royce studying him intently. He quickly turned away. Lawyers tensed, one of them or another they had missed. The man was watching him again. Small, dark eyes alive and clever, shrewd, a man too shrewd for them or one of the things alien insect from beyond. The bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into the box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite voice. The elderly man caught the sharp eyed man's gaze for a split second. Something passed between them. A look rich with meaning. Voice got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step down into the well. He yanked the emergency door release the rubber door swung open. Hey, the driver shouted, jamming on his brakes. What the hell? I just wanted to keep reading until I got to say Hell, you take over, Okay? Lloyd's squirmed through the bus was slowing down houses on all sides, a residential district, lawns and tall apartment buildings behind him. The bright eyed man had leapt up. The elderly man was also on his feet. They were coming after him. Lloyd sleep. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against the curb. Pain lapped over him pain and a vast tide of blackness. Desperately, he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid down again. Busted, stopped. People were getting off. Loy's groped around his fingers closed over something. Iraq Lying in the gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed before him. A man, the bright eyed man with a book Boys kicked, the man gassed and fell. Voice brought the rock down. The man screamed and tried to roll away. Stop, for God's sakes, Listen, he struck again. Hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and dissolved in. A bubbling whale scrambled up in back. The others were there. Now, all around him, he ran awkwardly down the sidewalk up a driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped, were bending over the inert body of the man with the book, the bright eyed man who would come after him. He made a mistake, but it was too late to worry about that. He had to get out away from them. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between their world and hiss, he really shakes off a possible murder. He's too late to worry about that. That's in my past. That happened 10 seconds ago. I gotta move forward. Ed Janet Lloyd's backed away nervously. What is it? What? Ed Lloyd's slammed the door behind him and came into the living room. Pull down the shades, quick, Janet moved toward the window. But do as I say. Who else is here beside you? Nobody. Just the twins. They're upstairs in their room. What happened? You look so strange. Why are you home? You like the new vase? I bought it with the money we saved from the foundation work. You did. I'd lock the front door. He prowls around the house into the kitchen from the drawer under the sink. He slid out the big butcher knife and ran his finger along it Sharp. Plenty sharp. He returned to the living room. Listen to me, he said. I don't have much time. They know I escaped and they'll be looking for me. Escaped Janet's face twisted with bewilderment and fear. Who? The town has been taken over there in control. I've got a pretty well figured out. They started at the top at the City Hall in Police Department. What they did with the real humans, They? Where do you talking about? We've been invaded from some other universe. Some other dimension. They're insects mimic re and more power to control our minds. Your mind, my mind, their entrances. Here. I think this is the role you were born to play. Thank you. Janet. Lloyd's Jan Eloise. Their entrances here in Pikeville. They've taken over all of you the whole town except me. We're up against an incredibly powerful enemy, but they have their limitations. That's our hope. They're limited. They can make mistakes. Janet shook her head. I don't understand, Ed. You must be insane. Insane? No, just lucky. If I hadn't been down in the basement, I'd be like all the rest of you. Lloyd's peered around the window, but I can't stand here talking. Get your coat, My coat. We're getting out of here out of Pikesville. We've got to help to fight this thing. They can be beaten. They're not infallible. It's going to be close, but we may make it. If we hurry. Come on. He grabbed her arm roughly, get your coat and called. The twins were all leaving. Don't stop the pack. There's no time for that. White faced his wife, moved toward the closet and got down her coat. Where we going? Ed pulled open the desk drawer and spilled the contents out onto the floor. He grabbed up a road map and spread it open. Have all the highways covered, of course, but there's a back road tow oak grove. I got onto it once it's practically abandoned. Maybe they'll forget about it. The old Ranch road. Good Lord, it's completely closed. Nobody's supposed to drive over it. I know had thrust the map grimly and his coat. That's our best chance. Now call down the twins and let's get going. Your collar is full of gas, isn't it? Janet was dazed, so they keep going. Oh, man, Keep going. The Chevy I, Anna Philip. Yesterday afternoon, Janet moved toward the stairs ad I call the twins and unlock the front door and peered out. Nothing stirred. No sign of life. All right, so far. Come on downstairs. Janet called the wavering voice work going out for a while. Now, Let me do a different one for Tommy. No, Tommy's voice came. Hurry up that bark. Get down here, both of you! Tommy appeared at the stairs. I'm just doing my homework or starting fractions, Miss Parker says. If we don't get this done, you can forget about fractions, had grabbed his son as he came down the stairs and propelled him toward the door. Where's Jim? He's coming. Jim started slowly down the stairs, warts up dirt. We're going for a ride or ride where Ed turned to Janet will leave all the lights on and the TV set Go turn it on. He pushed her toward the set, so they'll think we're still. He heard the buzz on dropped instantly. The long butcher knife out, sickened. He saw it coming down the stairs at him wings. A blur of motion as it aimed itself. It's still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy. It was small baby, a brief glimpse thing hurtling at him. Cold multi lens in human eyes, wings, body still clothed in the yellow T shirt and jeans, the mimic outlines still stamped on it. A strange half turn of its body is it? Reached him. What was it doing? A stinger boy stabbed wildly at it, retreated, buzzing frantically, voice rolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still. A statue's faces blank watching, without expression. Lloyd's stabbed again. This time, the knife connected thing shrieked and faltered. It bounced against the wall and flutter down something lap through his mind. A wall of force energy, an alien mind probing into him, suddenly paralyzed. The mine entered his own, touched against him briefly, shockingly and utter alien presence settling over him, and then it flickered out as the thing collapsed and a broken heap on the rug. It was dead. He turned it over with this foot. It was an insect. A fly of some kind, yellow T shirt, jeans. His son, Jimmy. He closed his mind tight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely. He scooped up his knife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood stone. Still, neither of them moving. The car was out. He'd never get through. They'd be waiting for him. It was 10 miles on foot, 10 long miles over rough ground gullies and open fields and hills of uncut forest. He'd have to go alone. Loiseau opened the door for a brief second. He looked back at his wife and son. Then he slammed the door behind him and raced down the porch steps. Man, it is really quick to kill and move on. Too late for that. Just move. Yep. Stab and forget Sam. Make him forget. Um, okay. A moment later, he was on his way, hurrying swiftly through the darkness toward the edge of town. The early morning sunlight was blinding. Loy's halted gasping for breath, swaying back and forth sweat ran down in his eyes. His clothing was tor NW, shredded by the brush and thorns through which he had crawled 10 miles on his hands and knees crawling, creeping through the night. His shoes were mud caked. He was scratched and limping, utterly exhausted, but ahead of him lay oak growth. He took a deep breath and started down the hill. Twice. He stumbled and fell, picking himself up in, trudging on, his ears rang. Everything receded in wavered, but he was there. He had gotten out away from Pikeville. Ah, farmer in the field gaped at him from a house. A young woman watched in Wonder boys reached the road and turned onto it. Ahead of him was a gas station and a drive in a couple of trucks, some chickens pecking in the dirt, a dog tied with a string. The white clad attendant watch suspiciously as he dragged himself up to the station. Thank God he called a hold of the wall. I didn't think I was going to make it. They followed me most of the way. I could hear them buzzing, buzzing and flitting around behind me. What happened? The attendant demanded you and a wreck. Hold up. Lawyers shook his head weirdly. They have the whole town, the city hall in the police station. They hung a man from the lamppost. It was the first thing I saw. They got all the roads blocked. I saw them hovering over the cars coming in about four. This morning. I got beyond them. I knew it right away. I could feel the belief. And then the sun came up. The attendant licked his lips nervously. You're out of your head. I better get a doctor. Kimmy and oh, Crow voice gasped. He sank down on the gravel. We've got to get started cleaning them out. I got to get started right away onto you, Chuck Er's. He kept a tape recorder going all the time. He talked. When he had finished, the commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet. He stood for a moment deep in thought. Finally, he got out his cigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face. You don't believe me, Loy said. The commissioner offered him a cigarette. Boys pushed it impatiently away. Suit yourself. The commissioner moved over to the window and stood for a time, looking out at the town of Oak Grove. I believe you, he said abruptly. Boy, sag. Thank God. So you got away. The commissioner shook his head. You were down in your cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a 1,000,000 boys sips from the black coffee they had brought him. I have a theory, he murmured. What is it about them who they are? They take over one area at a time, starting at the top, the highest level of authority, working down from there in a widening circle. When they're firmly in control, they go on to the next town. They spread slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on for a long time. EDS. Really? Filling in the blanks here at me, really it He's got it all figured out a long time. Thousands of years? I don't think it's new. Why do you say that? When I was a kid, a picture they showed us in Bible League, a religious picture, an old print, The enemy God's defeated by Jehovah Mohawk, be Elza bub, Moab Baylin. Ash to Roth. Chuck, I think you just raised a bunch of demons XO. So they were all represented by figures. Lawyers looked up at the commissioner. Biel's above was represented as a giant fly. Don't doom. Uh, commissioner grunted an old struggle. Don't don't, uh, They've been defeated. The Bible was an account of their defeats. They make gains. But finally they're defeated. Why defeated? They can't get everyone that they didn't get me. And they never got the Hebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The realization of the danger. The two men on the bus, I think they understood had escaped like I did. He clenched his fists. I killed one of them, had made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance. The commissioner nodded. Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped as you did freak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control. He turned from the window. Well, Mr Loi ce, you seem to have figured everything out. Not everything. The hanging man, The dead man hanging from the lamppost. I don't understand that. Why? Why did they deliberately hang him there? That would seem simple. The commissioner smiled faintly. Bait. Lloyd stiffened his heart, stopped beating bait. What do you mean, to draw you out, make you declare yourself so they'd know who was under control and who had escaped. Voice recoiled with horror than they expected failures. They anticipated. He broke off. They were ready with a trap. And you showed yourself, You reacted. You made yourself known. The commissioner abruptly moved toward the door. Come along. Royce has a lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste. Lawyers started slowly to his feet, numbed, and the man who was the man I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger, all muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed. That was a strange look on the commissioner's faces, he answered. Maybe, he said softly, You'll understand that, too. Come along with me. Mr. Loi ce. He held the door open, his eyes gleaming, Loy's caught a glimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a platform of some sort, a telephone pole and a rope. Right this way, the commissioner said, smiling coldly. All right, I think we know what's happening. Take its home. As the sun set, the vice president of the Oak Grove Merchants Bank came up out of the vault through the heavy time locks, put on his hat and coat and hurried outside onto the sidewalk. Only a few people were. They're hurrying home to dinner. Good night, the guard said, locking the door after him. Goodnight clearance, Mason murmured. He started along the street toward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the vault, examining the layout of the safety deposit boxes to see if there was room for another tear. He was glad to be finished. At the corner. He halted the street. Lights had not yet come on. The street was dim. Everything was big. He looked around and froze from the telephone pole in front of the police station. Something large and shapeless hung and moved a little with the wind. What the hell was it? Mason approached it wearily. He wanted to get home. He was tired and hungry. He thought of his wife, his kids, a hot meal on the dinner table. But there was something about the dark bundle, something ominous and ugly. The light was bad. He couldn't tell what it was. Yet it drew him on, made a move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made him uneasy. He was frightened by it, frightened and fascinated. And the strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it. All right, that's the hanging stranger by Philip K. Dick. Pretty good. What's your take? Whether he was insane or not? Yeah, I think the end proves that he was quite saying and that he would just be the next victim. Ah, the bank manager? No. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Voices. The next victim is part of a chain of bait. So I think he was saying, but he definitely killed another non possessed person and his son with a rock. But I think, though, because he wasn't insane, that his son was a human fly. Really? Like the cramp said? Yeah, because he was He was not insane. So what he saw was riel, Which means that him seeing his son flying around, trying to sting him was riel. All right, what's your take on it? Was that what you said? Okay, see, this is why we get along so well. Chuck, I got to see this thing visually, so I need to make this into a short film. It would be a pretty good one, I think. And it's public domain. Try understand. Ah, well, thank you very much, everybody. Happy Halloween to you. Hopefully you enjoyed this. Sure wasn't fact based.

There's Chuck. There's Terry. Let's get reading. Yeah, this year we decided to do a little Shorty Halloween, too, because, you know, we did our short stuff on Ambrose. Beers started poking around his short stories, and he wrote some super short ones that are kind of tailor made for this, I think. Yeah, it's almost like he was born in the 19th century thinking one day, Josh and Chuck, you're gonna have short stuff. I want to give them something to work with. Maybe so. So did prepare everyone for a Halloween spooktacular, which will be out tomorrow. We wanted to do this. That's right. You want to start? Ah, yeah. What's, um we'll start with the story one summer night. This is a good one. This is a good one. Here we go. One summer night. Bye. Ambrose Beers. The fact that Henry Armstrong was buried did not seem to him to prove that he was dead. He had always been a hard man to convince that he really was buried. The testimony of a senses compelled him to admit his posture flat upon his back with his hands crossed upon his stomach and tied with something that he easily broke without profitably altering the situation. The strict confinement of his entire person, the black darkness and profound silence made a body of evidence impossible to contra vert. And he had accepted it without Cavill Henry Cavill. But dead No, he was only very, very ill. He had, with all the invalids, apathy and did not greatly concern himself about the uncommon fate that have been allotted to him. No philosopher was he just a plain, commonplace person, gifted for the time being with a pathological indifference. The organ that he feared consequences with was torpid. So with no particular apprehension for his immediate future, he fell asleep and all was peace with Henry Armstrong. Before we go on here, check, I just want to point out. So this man is come to his senses in a coffin? Yes. Been like, Well, I guess I'm dead and then went to sleep. But then then he went to sleep. Yeah, that's a mellow gold. Totally, you know, may pick up here, please. But something was going on overhead. It was a dark summer night shot through with in frequent shimmers of lightning, silently firing a cloud, lying low in the west and pretending a storm. These brief, stammering illuminations brought out with ghastly distinctness the monuments and headstones of the cemetery and seemed to set them dancing. It was not a night in which any credible witness was likely to be straying about a cemetery, so the three men who were there digging into the grave of Henry Armstrong felt reasonably secure. Two of them were young students from a medical college a few miles away. The third was a gigantic man known as Jess for many years just have been employed aboutthe cemetery as a man of all work, and it was his favorite pleasantry that he knew every soul in the place. From the nature of what he was now doing. It was in for a ble that the place was not so populous as this register may have shown it to be. Back to you, Charles. Back to you outside the wall, at the part of the grounds farthest from the public road for a horse in the light wagon waiting, the work of excavation was not difficult. The earth with which the grave had been loosely filled a few hours before, offered little resistance and was soon thrown out. So their grave robbing here, right? Oh yeah, it ties in very nice to do. Our episode on grave robbing is right. Removal of the casket from its box was less easy, but it was taken out for it was a prerequisite of Jess, who carefully unscrewed the cover and laid it aside, exposing the body in black trousers and white shirt. That instant, the air spring to flame cracking shock of thunder shook the stunned world. Henry Armstrong tranquil, a set up with inarticulate cries. The men fled in terror, each in a different direction for nothing on Earth could two of them had been persuaded to return. But Jess was of another breed. In the gray of the morning, the two students, palate and haggard from anxiety and with the terror of their adventure still beating tumultuously in their blood, met at the medical college. You saw it cried. One God, yes, What are we to do? They went around to the rear of the building, where they saw horse attached to a light wagon hitched to a gate post near the door of the dissecting room mechanically. They entered the room on a bench in the obscurity set. Jess, he rose, grinning. I'm waiting for my pay, he said, stretched naked on a long table. Lay the body of Henry Armstrong, the head defiled with blood and clay from a blow with a spade. Wow, Suggest to care. Business, Huh? He did. He said, Are you going to sit up right now while I'm trying to make some money? No, we're not gonna have that. We're going to put you back in the grave. Well, that was great, but we have more to come. Everyone, we have one more short story from the great Ambrose Bierce that we will read after these commercial messages.

Okay, I'm gonna start this one. All right. Take it away. An old man named Daniel Baker, living near Lebanon, Iowa, was suspected by his neighbors of having murdered a peddler who had obtained permission to pass the night at his house. This was in 18 53 when peddling was more common in the western country than it is now. It was attended with considerable danger. The peddler with his pack traversed the country by all manner of lonely roads and was compelled to rely upon the country people for hospitality. This brought him into relation with queer characters, some of whom were not altogether scrupulous, and their methods of making a living murder being an acceptable means. To that end, it occasionally occurred that a peddler with diminished pack and swollen purse would be traced to the lonely dwelling of some rough character and never could be traced beyond this was so in the case of Old Man Baker, as he was always called. Such names are given in the Western settlements. Only the elderly persons who are not esteemed to the general disrepute of social and worth as a fixed, the special reproach of age. A peddler came to his house and none went away. And that is all that anybody knew. All right, so we're talking about peddlers being murdered on the road. I have to say, Ambrose Bierce makes me look succinct. Yeah, you can write a paragraph about, like a lightning bolt flashing and this guy in parentheses. Alright, here we go. Seven years later, the Reverend Mr Cummings, a Baptist minister well known in that part of the country was driving by Baker's farm. One night was not very dark. There was a bit of moon somewhere above the light veil of mist that lay along the earth. Mr. Cummings, who was at all times a cheerful person, was whistling a tune, which he would occasionally interrupt to speak a word friendly encouragement to his horse. Get on, boy like that. That's friendly. As he came to a little bridge across the dry ravine, he saw the figure of a man standing apartment clearly outlined against the gray background of a misty forest. The man had something strapped on his back and carried a heavy stick. Obviously an itinerant peddler. His attitude had in it a suggestion of abstraction like that of a sleepwalker. Mr. Cummings reigned in his horse when he arrived in front of him, gave him a pleasant salutation and invited him to a seat in his vehicle. If you're going my way, he added, the man raised his head looked him full in the face, but neither answered nor made any further movement. The minister, with good natured persistence, repeated his invitation at this. The man through his right hand forward from aside and pointed downward as he stood on the extreme edge of the bridge, Mr Cummings look past him over into the ravine, saw nothing unusual and withdrew his eyes to address the man again. He had disappeared. Wow, I think you can take it home, Okay. The horse, which all this time had been uncommonly restless, gave at the same moment a snort of terror and started to run away. Before he had regained control of the animal. The minister was at the crest of the hill 100 yards along. It's like a football field. That's right. He looked back and saw the figure again at the same place and in the same attitude is when he had first observed it on the 20 yard line. Then, for the first time, he was conscious of a sense of the supernatural and drove home as rapidly as his willing horse would go on. Arriving at home, he related his adventure to his family in early the next morning, accompanied by two neighbors, John White core well in Abner razor surprised he didn't talk about those guys here returned to the spot. They found the body of old man baker hanging by the neck from one of the beams of the bridge immediately beneath the spot where the apparition had stood. A thick coating of dust, slightly dampened by the mist, covered the floor of the bridge. But the only footprints were those of Mr Cummings horse. In taking down the body, the men disturbed the loose free, a ble earth of the slope below it, disclosing human bones already nearly uncovered by the action of water and frost. They were identified as those of the lost peddler. At the double inquest, the coroner's jury found that Daniel Baker died by his own hand while suffering from temporary insanity, and that Samuel Moritz was murdered by some person or persons to the jury, unknown in the end, one of the least satisfying ending. Any short story Samuel Moritz. They didn't even name the guy it until that point. Oh, yeah, although that was great. I mean, I love Ambrose Bierce for some reasons, but not for that reason. You don't get the feeling that, like at the end of that book, he's just like face down in a like a methadone torp, or write in a trough of whiskey. Well, Chuck, I think that was short stuff, huh? That's right. Special Super short Halloween edition. The point of this is to get your prime for tomorrow. Spectacular. So don't miss it, everybody. And because I said Don't miss it, everybody.

Every Chuck Bryant over there, There's Jerry, and this is stuff you should know right before Halloween edition about it like a little kid every Halloween I'm pretty excited about. Yeah? Do you get trick or treaters? No, not really. No kind of life hashtag, et cetera. The, uh told my story before, but, uh, I'll just briefly summarize again that my house is after a big curve in the road and people seem to just stop it that curve in the road. Well, they don't want to come up on Old Man Bryant's house. No, you know the old dead oak tree with the big hole in it that yeah, Boo Radley hides figures in is kind of off putting. It's right on your property. And I think in my neighborhood to they close, they literally close off the cops close off two blocks. This just this big square, uh, of streets. And that's the official sanctioned no stress area where the parents I'll just walk around and get drunk and all the kids just run around and don't have to worry about cars, right? So, um, everyone in my neighborhood is congregated there and you're outside of venom outside comfort zone. Yeah, which I kind of miss like I like trick or treaters coming to my house. I guess I could maybe try and well could move a few houses in which I'm not going to dio we could casually move the roadblocks of a little further back to include your house, one of their actual police cars with police officers. I can't move them given. But I could put signs that, like, you know, this way for the best yet, and then you like only two more houses, right? Or, like leave a trail of candy. Remember when I first moved to Atlanta? We rented a house that got a lot of trick or treaters, and I loved it. Man, I scared the heck out of those kids. Oh, really? Yeah. It was a lot of fun, like I really got. That was my first big adult giving out candy night. Like the first time I've ever been able to do that, huh? Because he didn't have kids yet. So we weren't out trick or treating. And ah, yeah, I made a really a poem to music out. Like the psycho theme and scary John Carpenter stash. Er, I really enjoyed it. Did you, like, do anything too overtly scare them? Oh, yes, I worry. I was dressed up is a very scary person. Uh, and I would jump out and scare them over and over and over. Did you really jump out? Good for you, Chuck. Or I would stand that like Emily would be giving out candy. And I would just be in the darkened house, like, eight feet behind her to standing there motionless. That's always a nice tak But point is, I sort of feel like we're missing out. Like we certainly enjoyed taking our daughter out. But I really wish we had kids that came by. Yeah, I wish you did, too. Too bad. Yeah, a stupid house right there near the main road. So close yet so far away so far away. And that you're forever house too, huh? Yeah. No trick or treaters ever again for you and walked in there. But what we could do is, you know, we could go toe friend's house, and that's counting. You have to limp on their coattails. Can't sit on their couch. You have to take your shoes off in their house. You can't be comfortable. We've long talk to me and my friend Eddie and Allison. You know them about They have a good backyard about doing, like, a haunted trail one year, huh? That, like if you come trick or treating, you got to go through the trail first. It sounds like a lot of work. It is. And it would be fun. No, I mean, for the kids who have to go through the trail. Gotta earn right. You gotta earn that free candy earn that recess pieces. So we just hit upon, like, 15 different themes in this episode. If you'll If you'll agree, agree? Agree. Yes. Um, so we're talking about trick or treating here. And if you look at the thing on its face, just the words trick or treat. There seems to be some sort of option here. You could do one of the other used to be Give me a treat or you get a trick. Basically, Was the equation. Yeah. They should just change the name now to just treat night treat night, right? Exactly. Um, we aren't 100% sure on where trigger treating came from. But we do know is that it was originated in America in the 20th century and that there was this really, like, brief golden age where it lived up to his name, trick or treat. There was a there was an offer to not get pranked or tricked. And if you didn't take the people up on the offer, the kids up on the offer by giving him candy, you got pranked. That was the equation. It was in the name. Everybody knew the score, and then it slowly kind of moved over to what we understand the day where the police set up road blocks and everything is safe. These kids these days and it's just kinda just like you said, just the treat side of the equation. Yeah, I was, of course, kidding, but we'll get to it. There are people that really do decry this, a new generation of Children who just expect handouts and that it needs to the idea of the welfare state and all this other garbage that I have no patience for sure, because it's just a fun thing for kids. Yeah, or do you think they should be earning this stuff? No, no, no. I don't feel that way. I do feel well. I think it will come through loud and clear as we do the up. All right. Well, we should jump back a little bit to the origins of Halloween. We've gone over this before and episodes pass, but we all know it originally started as a pagan harvest or not just one. But pagan harvest festivals in general, Among the kilts over in the UK Yes, and ah, that evolved in the Halloween. But it had nothing to do with trick or treating at the time. No, it wasn't around again. Trick or treating is 100% American invention. That's right. Um, and so with Halloween in particular, you've got all these different components for the modern Halloween or for trick or treating. Yes, you have going from house to house. You have getting too, said House and asking for a treat. Basically sanctioned, begging to get in costume costume, dressing up. Got being outside, kind of parading around. All of these things find their origin in the Celtic. And I think specifically Gaelic, um, harvest festivals that introduced the the dark half of the year. That's right. And in particular, there was salad, which forever, I've always said Sam hanging because that's how it's spelled. Now you said Sal in right when we didn't have a minute. So didn't you? Probably. By the way, speaking of Salin or Samhain, you realize that I went to New York and saw the misfits on Saturday. Oh, yeah. How was that? I mean, where is great? Colossally amazing. This the original misfits, right? The original misfits Glenn Danzig. Gary only sure. Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein. Yeah. Who actually specifically invited us to this sufficient listener, right? Yes, Um, to this. Ah, this show. And it was amazing. Knock your socks off. Didn't the damned play as well? The damned open and then rancid. And then the misfits just tore the roof off. The second I saw when I saw you were going, I looked up some YouTube clips of this tour and it looked pretty amazing. It was amazing. And I think Glenn dancing said that was their last one ever. Really? And so we got to see it. Yeah. You mean I went had a great time. Amazing. So big. Big thanks to Doyle, Wolfgang von Frankenstein for the invite that the state said it looked great. It was It was just a really cool show. And they played almost everything. Yeah, Yeah, it was just That's fantastic. So, anyway, back to Saturn. Yes. Oh. Ah. I mean, that's a perfect time to mention that show, though. Yeah, all worked out. Um, how was Eve? Was the night considered when the veil between the living and the dead was the shortest? And so that's when this that's when Halloween formed, right? Right. So people would dress up in like modern day Ireland. Scotland, I believe Wales. Yeah, well, his man, um, they would dress up like demons or fairies or supernatural characters who were because this veil was so thin between the living and the dead for the supernatural, um, they could cross over. The priest could cross over and communicate. So if you dressed up like them, maybe they would be confused and think you're one of them and leave you alone. That's right. So this now we've got the costume thing going, right. That's right. And, uh, part of that was the community getting together. Ah, getting drunk on, you know, probably high octane mead, mead and stuff like that. And they would parade through the town. They saw Halloween parades all over the place. Right here in Atlanta, We have one of the best on little five points. You haven't. We prayed. Fantastic. Like when you think about the Halloween parade at your town like that is centuries millennia old? Yeah. That tradition is Yeah. So we have those two things going on, and then the one missing piece is knock, knock. Hey, give me candy. Right. But this we have the origins of which came and it's still not Halloween. It took American kids to put all this stuff together, but, uh, the European tradition of Soling, which was when kids on Hallow's Eve would go from house to help house and pray for the souls of the departed. And in exchange, you would get a soul cake. Yeah, which I looked up. They look pretty good. What is it? Just little bit good? It looks like a muffin top, like top of the muffin to you. Ah, it looks really good. Soul cakes or mum ing, which is in this sounds fantastic. Which kids still had to do this stuff. Ah, you would have to perform a short, a musical number or some kind of performance to get ah, treat of some kind, right? Maybe a little spare change, right? So in that sense, you have going to house the house in getting something from the owners of the house like a treat or something like that. That's right. But there was a reason for that. Praying for the soul of their departed. Loved one doing a little dance number. Something like that. The prank part, the prank part of the equation that also existed before. Trick or treating, too. And in fact, that was kind of the order. The biggest tradition of Halloween itself was pranking. Yeah, that came from Ireland. Is that right? Yeah. Supposedly in the 18 eighties, they would prank. They would just run around doing pranks, and then they would blame those fairies or demons. Right on. Sow in, um, for the mischief that it wasn't us, it was the fairies. Sam Hain, right? I mean, it sounds. That's how it's spelled. Yeah, it's really That's a confounding pronunciation. It is. But there you have it. That's right. On, then. Pranks back then. And of course, we're pretty low key. Uh, ding dong ditch stuff like that, um, moving the neighbors furniture to the roof. I saw that. Yeah, like a flower pot on the chimney. Sure, but it would also get way, way worse than that. Yeah, I looked up Mischief night. We never did that in Georgia. No. Devil's Night is also called. Yeah, which is the night before Halloween, when all these pranks would happen. Um, region to region is called different. Apparently in, uh, New Jersey. It's mischief night for Cabbage night. Well, in Camden New Jersey is Mischief Night. Other parts of New Jersey call it Cabbage Night. Cincinnati calls it Damage Night. It's pretty over. That's a punk band name right there. Damage, right? Yeah, totally. That insurance deductible night. Other part. I don't know why Ohio is so highly represented here. Beggar's Night is something else. We called it in Ohio. Check because there's nothing else to do in Ohio. But sit around and wait for that night for Hallow's Eve. Other names. Doorbell, Nitric night, Corn Night Ticket, Tech night, Gussie night and then in Canada. Ah, gay Tonight Ormat night. If you're in Quebec M 80 they would take They would steal the gate off your fence or the mat from your door step and really remove it. Yeah, Okay, so they're pretty on the nose, Especially damage night. But, ah, Devil's Night in Detroit. It became legendary over about a 20 year period in the seventies and through the mid nineties. I saw before they finally got a little bit of a, um could put a dent in it by forming angels night. Yeah, they kind of re re branded. It will not re branded. The angels were volunteers who would walk around to keep kids from setting everything on fire. Okay, because that's what they did on Devil's Night. It was a night of Ours is a night of arson. I thought that it ran its course because they burned all the buildings down Detroit. There was nothing else left. It was a real problem, though. I looked into it and, like hundreds of kit like in 1994 I think there were, like, 315 kids arrested from double tonight, fires and other stuff in 1984 the peak of Devils night in Detroit. There were 810 cases of arson in one night. Amazing Detroit. Yeah, they would just set the city on fire. And I'm sure some of these were bags of poop on a doorstep. Right, Which I think we can all agree is harmless fun. It is, unless you're the step e So ever did any of the stuff? I never rolled the house. Oh, you didn't know I was so mad. I was so busy being good. Never too late, buddy. I know I should roll a house, work a yard. I don't know what that is the plastic forks Just basically get like, 2000 plastic forks and stick him in the Really? Yeah, I've never heard of that. We never did that. Nobody really chew up along more. I never egged the house cause I always heard you really damages paint. Yeah, we did have the junior senior egg fight every year. That was kind of fun. Well, you go. You got something we could get together in a field and, uh, their exit each other. Aside from wasting a ah, a lot of this resource with, Well, eggs, Yes, but also toilet paper. You really should roll somebody's house. At least it's great. Is it? Yeah. All right. Yeah. I'm gonna roll your condo. I remember when I was a kid. Actually, my friend and I rolled the neighbor's house, but we had to be in a release. So we're doing it basically in broad daylight. Was dusk at best? Yeah, and a cop drove by, which never happened. Yeah, in our neighborhood, ever. Never. The cops just weren't needed, right? It was just I think we talked about in the free range episode your parents up so you could just do whatever and, um, we had to knock out of the house of the neighbor whose house we just rolled toe. Let us in to hide from the cop. I went out and told the cup like it's it's fine. Don't worry about it. We roll her house and had toe get safe Harbor from her. Yeah. And you can't really clean up a rolled house, can you? You can find a way out of the rain if they come. Tell your parents what you did. How do you feel? The rain makes it way worse. Yeah, but, I mean, you can't find out there. Can you write some of its inevitably stuck up there? But you can pull it down as gingerly as you can. Okay. Get a CZ much as you can, but no sums gonna be left over. All right? I'm gonna roll a house, okay? Just know whose house you're rolling like you don't want to get shot at or anything, but I don't see that anymore either. I feel like it. I mean, I don't live in the suburbs. Maybe it's a little more prone to happen there. Yeah, but it seems like a lost art. It very well. May be I don't know anybody who rolls. I just assumed it was because we'd outgrown it. You know, Emily called it tp ing a house. Yeah, that's Ohio. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's take a break. We've barely talked about this. I think we're one page in. Good. That's great. All right. Mmm. You know, Chuck out. Some people are like, Oh, the holidays come earlier and earlier every year. Like it's some sort of problem. Yeah, well, I would tell those people, Chuck, that they need to try make Cafe's new seasonal treats because they're going to get them in the holiday spirit. Right quick. That's right, man. We're talking warm, flaky donut sticks made fresh every morning sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. They are back, everybody. And now a new chocolate dipping sauce comes along with it. Delicious. Yeah. Plus, let's just talk about the new cinnamon cookie lot. That's right. It's made with cinnamon sugar syrup, hand stirred with milk and rich, freshly brewed espresso, man. And then it stopped off with a Sprinkle of cinnamon. Yeah, it tastes like the holidays, and it's gonna put you in the holiday spirit warm up to the holidays with donuts sticks, now a chocolate sauce and the new cinnamon cookie lot on Lee from McCafe Good is brewing for a limited time only at participating McDonald's stuff you should know, Theo. All right, so to recap, Chuck, we have the costumes in play. Now we have being out on Halloween night sometime parading drunkenly community. Um, we have going from house to house and we have the prank factor. That's right. All of these things are out there floating around. Have been out there for centuries, millennia by the time America is born and makes it to the 20th century. And at some point some kids said we think, Hey, you know what? We could pull all this together and turn it into something really amazing and peculiar and unique, called trick or treating. That's right. You found a great piece. Ah, from a sociologist name Sameera Koosh grainy, called Gangsters, pranksters and trick or treating 1930 to 1960. And is this that pure period? Yeah, that you were talking about where she thinks that American kids just created this thing. Yeah, there's two historical views because we don't know where it came from. One historical view. And I think this is what Carwash believes, too, is that it was actually kids who figured this out, which is great. Who said we can extort adults to not prank them if they give us treats right? And that it was a genuinely a kid invention of kids. They made it up right, and there's some evidence for that kind of thing. Ah, lot of like the early newspaper accounts of it kind of call the kids Gangsters and say they're extorting people. It's also possible that was, like written super tongue in cheek, right? And that that dry, it was kind of dry and lost to the ages. Yeah. The other historical view is that the kids were out pranking in doing the pranks, and it was Theodore ts that introduced treats into the equation to buy them all. Okay, Do you have to keep them from pranking, right? Ah, Los Angeles, possibly as the point of origin. Um, and this one wealthy kids, I guess that makes sense that this would be the idea of, like, kids of privilege. Sure. You know, uh, I come around, give me stuff. Ah, but apparently in Los Angeles, kids in the wealthy parts of town would dress up and their parents would take them around from house to house. And this is, um this is that pre 1930 period, though? Yeah, they think sometime in the twenties. And if you think about it, that really resembles what we do today. Yeah, but in between that origin and where we've arrived today, there was this pure period 1930 to 19 sixties. Some people might even take it a little further beyond that, where the kids seem to have run the show. And, um, there there really was both sides of the equation. A trick or a treat. Right? But that term actually was in 1927 and an article, right? Said the first time they found the two words and print together, right? I guess. Three words. Ah, that was in an article about a town, uh, called Blackie in Alberta, Canada. Yeah, and it seems like all of it was sort of on the West Coast early on. Yeah, And again, they think possibly it did originate in Los Angeles, or it may have originated in multiple towns on the West Coast, roughly at the same time. But we're thinking twenties because in 1919 there was a book by Ruth Edna called Ruth Anne Kellan Ruth Enda Kelly called the Book of Halloween on it didn't mention any kind of trick or treating in there. No, and it's like an exhaustive, comprehensive homemakers overview would have been in there right for sure. And you gotta think like poor Ruth Anne Kelly is like, If I just waited, like, two years about this book out, they're gonna come up with something brand new with Halloween. Two years after I come up with this book, I wrote the book on it, right? Not quite now, without a date, But they did find mentions of it in newspapers out West Portland, Washington, Reno, Nevada, Nevada, Helena, Montana. And you can kind of track its progress from the dates. Mentions the Westies for articles, right? Yeah. Um, So there's those two sides. One say that it was kids who came up with it on their own. Um, perhaps they were introduced with the idea of going from house to house to get treats in Los Angeles. But then they said, Well, we're also doing these prank ings. Maybe we can say, Hey, we won't prank you if you give us a treat, right? There's that view. The other view again is that, um it was adults who said, Whoa, kids, you know, we don't want you setting fires any longer derailing streetcars because everyone's well, somebody would die. Yeah, people get shot at by angry neighbors. Um, sometimes somebody would be in one of those buildings that they set on fire and they die. People would die in a building that kid said on fires a Halloween prank. So for the most part, though, it was his kind of, um, tolerated as one night a year when the kids basically had power and were allowed to run the show. Um, so that this idea, this other historical view that adults finally said, Hey, you know, we're not gonna just say you can't do pranking. That probably be a bad thing, But why don't we just start having parties on Halloween night? What about pranking? And they'll be cider and doughnuts, and you can come inside and bob for apples and maybe do that instead of running round pranking the neighborhood. And once you did do that, you went from. And this is umm Samir Carwash putting it like you under the rules of society. You went from this powerful kid who could levy a prank on you if he or she wanted to. To ah, houseguest of the adult who now had you in right and had given you donuts. Insider, are you really going to set their house on fire? Is a prank after that? Course not. You're not going to. So in this sense, trick or treating was something the adults introduced to keep kids from carrying out these pranks. Yeah, And it was by the time World War Two came around, it was a big thing in the 19 forties. But of course, with sugar rationing and just the fact that there was World War Two going on it put a dent in it for a little while. But it came back, um, bigger than ever had been after the war, and I mean, seriously, it came very close to dying out. Going on World War two year, it was pretty new. Hadn't gained that much traction. There were a lot of cranks and grumps who were not happy about this kind of thing. I'm curious. What else had died in the war and never came back? There's got to be lots of little things. That's a great question. Look it up. But there were a couple of big pop culture sort of tent poles that helped Halloween along. Charles Schulz is peanuts. Of course, it wasn't the great Pumpkin Charlie Brown. Yet that was the sixties, I think. Yeah, but in 1951 he had a four day, um, comic strip run around Halloween where the Peanuts Gang got already and got their costumes going. And that really brought it to the forefront. Ah, and then Donald Duck Ah, was a cartoon Donald Duck, trick or treat a year after that, that had Donald, working with his nephews, are trying to prank his nephews while they were trick or treating right and working with the witch. And then the candy companies get involved. There was also ah very famous costume company called Ben Cooper Costumes. Yeah, they're the ones who don't buy the cheap yes, plastic mask, like a vinyl small. That's right. But they had this really great talent of identifying what was going to be like a culture phenomenon before it ever blew up, get the cheap. But they were also making these things, like, 10 months before they really had to have foresight, and they were really good at it. But the fact that you could get cheap, amazing costumes that the little kids all wanted of their favorite character. Yeah, that definitely helped things along, too. Yeah, it was. It's hard to overstate. Like, how big of a deal it was to a kid to be that certain. Whatever they wanted to be. I think it's still that way. I'm sure it is. But now it's a lot easier, I think, to buy costumes, right? I think when you and I were kids, there's a lot of fashioning costumes, huh? Ah, when you didn't have the ability to be like the alien from alien or, you know, it was a lot harder to put together these elaborate costumes. My once you got your heart set on it. You like you had to Sure, you know. So I'm gonna tell you my best costume. Then you tell me yours. Okay. Okay. Um, my mom made one from scratch clown. Just clown costume, but the big kicker was that it was an upside down clown walking on his hands. So my feet were the clown's hands. Yes, head is like dangling between my legs. I've got his legs sticking up off of my shoulders and I don't remember. My head must have been covered up like I was in his butt or something like right. But I was upside down Walking club. Greatest costume ever. Really? Yeah. Get any pictures somewhere? Yeah, OK, I did a lot of funny ones like my brother and I were Hans alone Luke Skywalker when I was really little. Um, but then I got into, like I was always wanted to like funny characters. I like like like Ed Grimley. One year, the center at Live Character. I did Ed Grimley One year to go and I was, I don't know. I felt like I was always trying to make people laugh. I never did scary stuff right until little kids started coming around and trick or treating at your house. Yes, and you started to score like movie characters, like even into my adult years. You know, I would try and find some cool movie character like h igh from raising Arizona. I did one year, and it's almost a grimly same here. Uh, now, not actually. Ah, And then one year I did Ah, great. Actually won a contest in New Jersey when you're when I was a hearty Kushner and I, like, shave my head and did the whole thing. Wow. Had literature. I passed out. Wow. Made the whole the whole deal. You just ended up joining a local chapter in for a little while. It's fine, really got into the role, but I haven't. It's been a few years since I've dressed up, uh, I'm here because I just Oh, that's not true. I haven't I haven't been to a Halloween party in probably five years, right? What were you last year? I was Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. So you were you. But with the time right, like a giant inflatable brick cell phone and you me was a specific Michael Jackson. A moment of Michael Jackson's history where he's holding blanket over the BALCO. Sure, and Momo was blanket. It's on. You could see it on Instagram. That's great. You have to check that out. All right, so the candy company started getting involved where I left off Yeah, band in the costume company. They knew it was gold for him. Um, Mars, incorporated in the early 19 fifties, were doing ad campaigns on TV and in newspapers and on the radio and stuff about trick or treat. Um, it became a thing with UNICEF. They had a trick or treat for UNICEF campaign. Back then, I think they still might. You know, you know, I'm talking about the little boxes I think holds change. Yeah, and they would just give him the little kids. And while they're out trick or treating, they'd also asked for change for UNICEF, right to help needy kids overseas. And that actually went really long way to legitimizing, trick or treating. Yeah, they're doing a lot these days, too, for kids Special needs kids like it's it's taken this long to finally get the word out like the Blue Pumpkins. Have you heard of those? If you trick or treat with a blue pumpkin, that means that you have some sort of special need where you may not be able to walk to a front door. It's a trick or treat. I'm dressed is right. You know, Michigan J bullfrog. What would be a great costume. It would be. But did you pull that off of, uh, Smith? Yeah. Wow. Nice. He's been on my mind lately, I guess. Huh? But ah, So people know like, Oh, you've got a blue pumpkin. So I shouldn't say like, you know Come on, kid. Why don't you tell me what your costume is? And ah, it's good that like that it's taken. It's ironic that it's taken this long to get parents on board to the fact that some kids need, you know, different kinds of treatment. I don't know if ironic is the best word. As much as disappointing is Yeah. You know, you're probably right. We take another break. Oh, my God, We're going to take three more. No, no. Okay, yes, we will then problems. It's human nature to hate problems. But why is that? After all, problems inspire us to mend things bend things make things better. That's why so many people work with IBM on everything from city traffic, toe ocean, plastic, new schools to new energy flight delays to food safety, smart loves problems. IBM. Let's put smart toe work. Visit IBM dot com slash smart toe learn more stuff you should know. All right. So I think basically what we're saying when we left off it. Sorry about the astrology here, everybody, but I mean, come on. You get us in a room? Yeah, around Halloween, it's gonna happen. Um, so by the early fifties, ah, trigger treating was huge and established and had So if the 1930 in the 1960 was the heyday, the golden age of trick or treating Um 1952 1959 Was the salad days of the heyday. Right? And when did people start complaining about it? The seventies? No ineighty snow nineties. Far back is the twenties. Oh, really? Yeah. Because those newspaper articles that you can track the progress of Halloween more often than not, they were like old cranks complaining about how they don't wanna have to give tricks or treats or whatever it little kids, right? Don't you blackmail me? They don't exactly, You know, what are we teaching our kids? And there's actually, um if you kind of scratch beneath the surface of trick or treating at first, it appears to be kind of Ah ah, weird power struggle between kids and adults. and it definitely is that. Yeah, but there's also another power struggle going on between adults of two different minds. Once or like you're over parenting by being upset about this or like this is just one night a year. It's good for kids, and other people are saying like This is terrible for kids allowing them to go from house to house, the bag Is it just a bad idea? It's unsafe is another way to put it to you. So there's like a struggle, weirdly over trick or treating. And it has to do with under parenting and over parenting and that conversation about the whole thing. I have seen parents ruin kids experiences, whether it's like a ah, Easter egg hunt or trick or treating. I've seen this in action because they're too involved. Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's what it comes down to, is just how involved are you in your kids trick or treating? For a very brief period? There was very little involvement in kids trick or treating. Um, and a lot of people say that's actually really good for kids in this other way that we kind of started to evolve toward is not. Yeah. I don't remember my parents taking me around trick or treating. I'm sure that happened. Maybe when I was really little, and we certainly would have had to go somewhere else because, you know, I lived on the minute dirt road yet The dirt road with no no neighbors, um, are very few of them. But I just all of my memories stem from being, like, probably 10 15 and being completely on my own with my friends 10 to 15 10 years old, but to 15. That's pretty late. What? To trick or treat? Oh, yeah. Oh, now we trick or treated up until probably that, like the ninth or 10th grade. Well, we'll get to it, but in some places, you get to get arrested for that. When did you stop? You'd still trick or treat if they would let you. Ah, I think I stopped her on 13. You know, maybe 15 was too late. Maybe 13 or 14. You're find off teams. Great. Go with God. No, but you're You're probably right. Now that I look back, maybe I went a Halloween parties, but maybe there's a kind of an unofficial slash official again in some places cut off after 12. Really done. Yeah, because 13 year teenager now and that's that's not kid's stuff, as we'll see allegedly trick or treating is a transition from Kid Hood to adulthood. And by the time you're 13 you've you've made that transition that's in your past. It's sad, but it's I don't know why I'm talking like Christopher walking on this, but I am. Yeah, maybe I wasn't going that way, but I definitely remember going by myself at a certain point. But now, with my neighborhood is just I see mostly parents not involved at all. There, there, there, kind of like if your child is two or three helping them walk to the door and stash ER, but otherwise we're just drinking and the kids were doing their thing. So let's talk about this thing. Let's skip toward the end, we will jump back. Okay, there is, um, this debate over you know whether it's better to just kind of cross your fingers and hope for the best and let your kids go out and trick or treat on their own, whether that's good or whether we need thio the world just to one safe for that. And we need to much more manage kids trick or treating than just letting them go out on their own. It depends where you are. That's the big divide. Yeah, and one of my personal heroes, the world's worst mom, Lynn or Skin as e. Who came up with the free range kids blawg, right? And the whole movement. Frankly, she makes this really great point that when we let kids trick or treat, we let them confront danger, like on their own. And it's really it's just a thin the narrowest margin of danger. I mean, people always talk about like the, um you know, all of the worst things that could happen on Halloween when the kids are triggered, train getting hit by a car, getting kidnapped by a stranger, getting like, um, like the razor blade. Yes, just just stuff that happens and it can happen. It's true, but it happens so infrequently that the chances are it's not going to happen. And you're actually better off just letting the kid roll the dice. Because this Lynn or skin, as he puts it, when when you go trick or treating, you're transitioning from being a kid to a grown up, and you're doing this quite literally. You go with your parents first, and they can teach you the rules of the road like just take one piece of candy or that house over there has their lights off. So leave them alone. They don't wanna have anything to do with this. And then after that, you let him go on their own, right? And they kind of take the ball and roll with it. And she says that, um that when there are trick or treating kids dressed like grown ups, yeah, they take to the streets at night, they encounter the scariest possible locals, which is in goblins. And then, yes, they're doing at the scariest possible time night. And the whole thing is dress rehearsal for adulthood. And then, like, that's the benefit of trick or treating. I don't quite get that. That is the same as adulthood, like you and I, all the time walking around night fighting goblins and witches, right? Exactly. Where would we have been without drinker treating that prepares for fighting goblins? All right, but just confronting fears turn their own without their parents managing their world for them, right? So that they can handle themselves, have the confidence to know they can handle themselves. And, um, and I guess, feel good about having confronted their fears and got in candy and return. Let's not forget about that now. On the other hand, it's just just take the candy is fine, right? Mommy and Daddy made it perfect for you. All you have to do is come get the king. But you're in a perfect bubble and everything's fine. Yeah, so that I kind of tend to fall in line or skin as decide on that. Well, should we talk a little bit about the, um you know, whether or not there have been all these real horror stories over the years and whether or not any of those air true as faras the razor blade in the apple and stuff like that Hypothermic needles in candy. Um, this stuff doesn't happen. No. And the thing that point out and I know we've talked about it before, is that it? It was a an urban legend that came true, right? Ah, there was one case, and this is actually kind of funny. If he asked me In 1959 there was a dentist in California named William Shine. Hoo ah took al oh laxative pills and disguise them his candy and give out 450 of them jerk two kids. And they were all pooping. I guess so. I think a fume did prove nobody got injured. The right. You're not gonna get entered from a laxative. You could put over poop over poop. Ah, but this is when I think this really story got out. And then all of a sudden, he gets a morphed into needles and razor blades or poison or candy laced with heroin and stuff like that. Well, that did happen. Well, yeah, but that's the thing. Like the examples that are listed are reverse engineered. Almost right, Right. So there was a little boy in Texas who died from eating a cyanide, um, laced pixy stick right in Texas. And I can't remember what year, 74. And, um, it turned out that it was his dad, that his dad was the scum of the earth, who had taking taking out insurance policies on his own Children, Good Lord, and then gave them spiked Halloween candy to make it look like some mad poisoner killed his kids so he could collect insurance. One of his kids did die, but it was It wasn't just some random Halloween poisoner. That guy didn't really exist at the time. Yeah, 1970 in Detroit was the heroin incident. Um, this kid, uh, overdose these kids ate their uncle stash is what really happened. And then the uncles like, Oh, crap. All right, let me Sprinkle the heroin on the candy and cook up the story and maybe cook up some heroin, right? Since I'm cooking. Yeah, and, ah, to try and get out of this. So again, it really happened. But not in the way that you think. No, Um, the thing that got everybody. So that William Shine guy who I just think is a scale for that because he scared the pants off of America's parents. Yeah, he basically said, Hey, you know how you're letting your kids run free? Something really bad could happen to him. And I just showed you how. Yeah. And from the next year on, the parents were anxiously involved in Halloween like they never have been before. Sure, because of William Shine but, um the ah, the thing that really killed Halloween, or at least cemented, I think the anxieties and the heads of parents in America is that Tylenol poisoner. Oh, sure cancel. Halloween, 1982 didn't really almost drove Ben Cooper costumes out of business. Candy sales went down 50% trick or treated in 1982. Well, your parents didn't love you. I think I did, too. I don't remember not I would remember, not trigger treating one year. Yeah, because I would've been 11. That's prime time, right? Apparently those of the retirement years. But all of this stuff added a veneer of fear and anxiety on trick or treating. Four parents not for kids, necessarily, but for Paris. And it drew them into what was possibly just a kid run activity because of fear, probably irrational fear. And now you have to this day the FDA sending out guidelines around Halloween, saying, Don't let your kids eat any candy until they bring it home right, which is just torture, and you have to inspect it. And if you see any pinholes or tears or anything that looks weird, just throw it away. Some hospitals say bring your kids candy and we'll x ray. Yeah. To see if there's any razor blades or needles in it or something like that. This is the kind of terror that, ironically, is over laid on Halloween. It's like fun. Terror has actual real terror on top of it, which makes it less fun. We don't inspect candy. Oh, you don't roll the dice, huh? Yeah, that's great. I don't know anyone who does. Really? Oh, man, I was raised like that. You inspected candy? Oh, yeah. My parents were serious about it. We never did. I don't now. I just I don't know that degree. Maybe it's that thing of like, if you're the because it doesn't happen, right, I'm no. I'm heartened to hear that. Yeah, because there when we did our free range kids episode, I remember thinking like, what's what's going on now? Like like kids were treated like this. They're not rising by Halloween candy. It's just not happening. Right, you know? Yep. Plus, in our neighborhood with the sanctioned closure, all the candy is people aren't buying their own candy. It's like the neighborhood buys all the candy and they congregated in these couple of blocks. That's cool. Yeah. Okay. I mean, there could be a madman living among us. It happened. But that's like being scared to walk out your front door for fear of being murdered. Right? Right, Chuck, you know, you just can't live that way. I can't live that way. You know, You me told me a story about Ah, Vili. Like villages in Japan have, like a festival or two every year, like the whole community comes out. It's like a big deal. And there was one village, little tiny town where, um, this one woman just, I guess, went mad and poisoned the curry that she brought to the village thing and killed a bunch of townspeople. It happens. It does happen. But you're right. You can't not eat the curry just because of the small, small chance that some mad person is poisoned it. Yeah, The way I look at it is, if that's what happens then this You know your numbers up, your number's up and your story in the newspaper to scare other people. Sure, you get to be immortalized on stuff you should know. It's trick or treat going away, Josh. I don't know Chuck, I say no. Okay, that's good. I'm glad to hear that. Because again, I'm living hash tag condo life. I'm out of the action. Yeah. I mean, there's this the last bit of this article he sent, talked about it, um, going away potentially. But I just I don't think that's ever ever gonna happen. So what do your arguments for it going away? That it might My arguments or your unit in my observation. Your observations, um, one of the big ones is that fear among parents that helicopter parenting has not been good for trick or treating. Okay, okay. But but the But that's a real struggle going on right now over parenting versus under parenting. Which one's gonna win out, right? Okay, um, another one is there's a perception that that trick or treating is dying out, which is kind of funny, is there? Yes, because people are moving back into towns and gentrifying those towns like we talked about in the historic district episode. Um, and as they're doing that Ah, the trick or treating was never huge in the city. And so people who are raised in the suburbs and you were used to are moving into the city and there's no trick or treating going anymore. So I guess trick or treating is dying because that's what I'm seeing. I differ. I beg to differ with that, too, Okay, but I mean, you don't live in the city City. You live in a neighborhood yet, but that's all. Atlantis is a bunch of neighborhoods. Okay, you do mean I don't live downtown. Maybe these people live in Des Moines. I don't know. No one lives in downtown Atlanta. No, it's true. Although it has gotten cooler than it was like a decade ago. Sure, Ah, but I beg to differ. That trick or treating doesn't go on in the cities. I think I think their apartment buildings in New York, where people trick or treat like just cause. It's not the picket fence. Suburban neighborhood. Sure. Ah, I think trick or treating goes on everywhere, But this author's at my house. Julie Back, who wrote in the Atlantic. She put it really well that basically the suburbs and trick or treating just go hand in hand. Sure, like the suburbs air set up for trick or treat. Oh, yeah, you've got houses that are close together. Super safe. Yep. We're people who live there just well enough off Thio buy enough candy for the whole neighborhood. They all have kids. They know each other enough that you're not embarrassed for your kid to go up in trick or treat there. And you know that it's this candy is not gonna be poison in the city. You're much more Ah, isolated from one another even though you're living on top of one another. Yeah, and I think maybe if if we're talking about like, uh, areas where there are poor kids and where poverty is run rampant than maybe there's less traditional trick or treating. But there are programs and parties and things they try to do for those kids to. Okay, so those very things may end up being what kills trick or treating that I should say, the purest version of trick or treating. You can also just make the case. Well, that's what it's evolving into and just go with it. I think that will probably be both, but you're talking about the big Halloween parties, community parties, trunk or treating trunk or treating for ah, what's it called? Halloween gaining Halloween tailgating trunk or treating. This is the idea that you and we had this other school. We had the Halloween festival, but that did not replace trick or treating. Okay, this replaces trick or treating for a lot of Children. Yeah. So you could You go out and you get in a big church parking lot. Essentially. Yep. And you have bobbing for apples and the dunk tank. Oh, this is different. And, huh? This is a little different than that. Well, I mean, I've seen these in person and Ah, okay, but that's a Halloween festival you're talking about. No, no, no. I'm talking about instead of trick or treating, okay? It's a big party. Okay? Where they have candy and they have activities and games and stuff. Are you going from car to car getting candy like the cars or houses? Ah, no, not necessarily. But they're giving out candy. We're not talking about trying to treat it. Feels very nit picky to me. Nobody. It's not. And here's why. I'm not talking about a Halloween festival, though. Okay, Let's find this Fine. I'm not talking about trunk or cheating either. You mean you walk five feet to a car, and they give you candy than five feet to another, nor even less than fun. They say, Don't play any games. Don't bob for apples or don't do anything else. All you're doing is walking the guard. I'm not saying that they don't have bobbing for apples, but the the purpose of trunk or treating is to basically set up a safe ring of cars where the kids were literally penned in. Yeah, the kids who used to be the one to were running the show are now penned in by the anxious adults cars handing out candy rather than going to houses, working around a church parking lot for trunk or treating instead of trick or treating. Yes, they're not the kids who could pull. I'm not gonna replace triggered what the kids in the Goonies did were able to pull off because they had freedom and spark that kids who trunk retreat are being denied. Right the as Let me go back to my friend Lynn or skin Nancy, she says. The trunk or treating is just another adult lead activity, one that reinforces the community killing idea that kids aren't ever safe outside the home school or supervised program. And that is most definitely the message that kids get when their trunk or treating. Yeah, I think that is not going to kill, trick or treating or take over trick or treating. Well, see, Chuck, I hope you're right, because one thing I have not seen since I've lived in Atlanta is any big trunk or treating activities. Well, that's because you live in Atlanta. All you have to do is go out to the suburbs and they're everywhere. But the suburbs were made for trick or treating their on the neighborhoods. I gotta end on a quote. I ran across a Ah, a um, website, I guess. The church website that's talking about trunk or treating. It's awesome. This quote, it says that the scariest part about the night this is a trunk or treating night isn't the costumes. It's the possibility that you could miss out on the chance to use trunk retreat to build relationships and reach these kids with the gospel. Well, yeah, that is the opposite of what Halloween is all about. That's right. Um, anything else? It's about arson. 810 cases of it. Sorry, I'm one of those curmudgeons, It turns out Ah, one more thing. Yes. If you like Halloween, go on to our old stuff. You should know website and search Halloween and creepy. And you're gonna find some amazing slide shows we put together over the years. Right? Remember that one of my favorite is cute and cruddy Halloween costumes. Vintage Halloween costumes. Have a really creepy best jack lanterns, all sorts of great stuff. Remember those days where we count page views and get excited about them? Yeah, this one felt like a bit of a tirade. Yeah, was it? I don't think so. Okay, Well, if you want to know more about Halloween, get out there and trick or treat. And since I said that it's time for a listener, man, this is follow upon pere feel ia's that we wanted to read for the last few weeks. Just now. Getting to it. Hey, guys. Long time listener. First time writer. I have had this episode pop up a few times. It's just been in my mind I'm an RN with m s n and background on have background on neuro physiology. Who enjoys studying abnormal psych. I understand you were doing a show in psychological terms on a psychological term. But you may have ended up painting wrong ideas onto certain practices, specifically S and M and cross dressing for what I have come to know. It's extremely rare that people practice thes primarily for sexual gratification. Course. These practices are adult in nature, but most regarded as an emotional practice for exploration of self. For example, Shah Bari, or rope bondage takes hundreds of hours of practice to perform, and those that partake describe a meditation like state. As a result, the most would say it's S and M. Most cross dressers describe the long process of becoming female as cathartic and self affirming, although being temporary, simplifying cross dressers to those who walk around in high heels to reach completion. Well, imagine saying that about a trans woman. Of course, if you were doing these practices for sexual gratification, all the power to you, I suggest you look into kink culture as an episode where a wide range of people congregate and share their interest in the community that is founded off respect and consent, their meet ups and presentations on practices so that others can learn proper technique the most that practice would like to keep their privacy. And that is from anonymous. Thanks a lot of anonymous. That was a good correction. Email.
