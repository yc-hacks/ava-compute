I want to bring you back to one of my favorite moments in sporting history, one that provides an important message about what you can do to be happier. It's August 2012 London Olympics. As the soundtrack to Chariots of Fire fills the stadium, gymnast McKayla Maroney, wearing her Teamusa trucks, is waiting to accept an Olympic medal. Finally, her name is called, prompting a huge cheer from the crowd. She waves steps onto the podium and takes a deep breath that she bows her head. An official slips the metal over the ponytail, which holds back her hair so fiercely that all her features seem drawn upwards all except her mouth that this Michaela is doing her best to keep a straight face. But she's barely suppressing a frown. Michaela shakes the officials hand and mouse, thank you over the crowd noise. Another official presents the medalist with a bunch of flowers, a flicker of a polite smile crosses Michaela, slips for Justin Instant and then fades. And then it happens, the face for just a second. In front of thousands of Spectators and millions of TV viewers around the world, MMA Kayla's mouth grimaces, contorting sharply to the left. It's a look that somewhere between annoyance and downright contempt. So why was Makayla scowling in front of all her fans. It was because of the metal around. McHale is neck. She just won the Olympic silver. In subsequent interviews, Makayla was everything you'd expect from a top ranking Olympian. She accepted that her unexpected fall in the vault competition men. She didn't deserve to take gold. She asserted that she was happy with her runners up metal. But on that podium in London, just for a second, Michaela's face told another story. But here's an even bigger puzzle. The Russian gymnasts Maria Pacifica, who is also on the podium that day. And she did even worse. She only took the bronze medal. But the weird thing is, Maria looked much, much happier than Makayla did. So how can that be? The answer, it turns out, involves a very common cognitive bias, one that doesn't only played champion athletes. It's a bias that plagues all of us, and it's one that's impeding our happiness more than we expect. Our minds are constantly telling us what to do to be happy. But what if our minds are wrong? What if our minds are lying to us, leading us away from what will really make us happy cook fears, is that understanding the science of the mind and point us all back in the right direction. You're listening to the happiness lab with Dr Lori sent this. If you were asked to choose which metal you'd want gold, silver or bronze, I'm pretty sure I could predict your order of preference. Even in crude monetary terms, the gold plated metal is more prized than the silver, which in turn is more valuable than the copper alloy one. But what if I were to ask you to rank the medals in order of which you think would bring you the greatest joy? Would you stick with those choices? I bet you would. Which is one of the reasons everyone got so obsessed with McKayla, Maroney's scout. How could she be so upset with a silver medal? Within days of the ceremony, Makayla second place grimace became a popular mean. She was Photoshopped into great moments in human history, the moon landing the fall of the Berlin Wall when Miley Cyrus cut her hair short in every event, Michaela is there looking on and scowling. Michaela, as the mean reminded us is not impressed. Michaela took her magnification with good grace even when she was asked to make the face in the Oval Office beside President Barack Obama. She also did the rounds on late night talk shows, fielding questions about the now infamous expression. Here she is, discussing the face with David Letterman. I thought to myself, I know exactly what's going on here. They've caught her at an introspective moment. She's probably not pleased with her performance. Would would rather have done better instead of silver. Would rather got the gold. And who can blame her? And they've caught her in just a contemplative moment, and now they're making it silly. Am I right about that? It is pretty funny. Letterman is right. Makayla was the hot favorite to take gold, her fall dash those hopes and momentarily broke her heart. But it turns out Makayla silver metal reaction is really common. Hello, my name is Michelle Kwan, Olympic figure skater. It's tough to find Olympians willing to talk about the crushing instant when the highest award in their sports slip through their fingers. Michelle Kwan, however, didn't hesitate for a single second when I asked her to relive the memories of the biggest upset in her glittering ice skating career. the 1998 Winter Games. I kind of let the waterworks happen. I mean that it was gonna happen. And, you know, as your kid, yes, you dream of going to the Olympics. You dream of winning gold, and you don't think of winning silver or bronze. And so it's a disappointment when you I have high hopes and you do everything to make it happen. Just like Michaela Michelle was predicted. No expected to take the gold. I was one of the favorites, for sure. Going into those Olympics, Michelle's performance was one of the most anticipated of the day. She came to the Nag, a no Olympics, just having won the national championship, where she earned an unprecedented 6.0, which is a perfect score in figures thing at the time. And Michelle's 1998 Olympic performance did not disappoint. Wearing a sparkly blue dress, she skated to Ah Hartman String Concerto called Lyra Angelica. The entire performance was flawless. I did perform both a clean, short program long program, meaning that I made no mistakes. Michelle look joyous when she left the ice, she even smiled up. Her dad was clapping furiously in the stands. I was overwhelmed because I felt like I did it. You know, I did it. I did everything that I had planned. I did every single jump. I did my my job and what I set out to Dio. And unfortunately, you know, it wasn't the best That night. Michelle's teammate, 15 year old Tara Lipinski, took to the ice a little later. Theo, it's were against her. No one so young are inexperienced, had ever won figure skating gold. But tears. Long performance was stellar. She had to triple triple jump combos and the crowd went wild. It was obvious that an upset was about to occur, and it, like, really happened. Within minutes, I knew from the reaction of just the applause that is going to be close. And so it was sort of nail biting. Um, but when the scores came out, I already know Terra had taken the gold. And just like that, Michelle was bumped to second place. Her gold medal dreams dashed. You didn't really have a moment, because then you're walking down the hallway and them. There's the press conference. It was just whatever, you know, like I was ready to answer questions, and I'm very candid and I'm very honest, and I think I might have cried a little bit and it's a disappointment and it's very wrong. I mean, it is, of course, a bit of a disappointment for an athlete not to get the gold. But what Wolf Michelle and Makayla seemed to be missing is the fact that they just one silver medals at the Olympic Games. They've each just proven that there amongst the very best athletes in the world. But Michelle and Makayla aren't the only ones to be disappointed. I mean champion British rower Katherine Granger, like in getting second place in Beijing to suffering a bereavement, and Canadian hockey star Jocelyn The Rock was so upset with her silver medal that she refused to wear it. Neither her coach nor her teammates, nor even the angry crowd chanting, Put your metal on, could change her mind. So what's going on? Well, it turns out all of these incredible competitors are in the throes of a rather common psychological error. We simulate alternative realities, and we react to events not just in terms of what happened, but what those simulations tell us might have happened easily could have happened almost happened. This is Tom Gilovich. He's a sports fanatic, both on the court and off. I looked around and there weren't that many over 65 basketball players. Tom was still shooting hoops well into his seventh decade. His knees miraculously were still holding up. Go out and play for court basketball. A few games come back to my office and I was just beat. Good for nothing. I have a job. I can't do that. That job is as a professor of psychology at Cornell University, Tom is a world expert on the biases that affect our choices and our well being. Back in 1992 Tom embarked on one of my favorite ever studies in the field of happiness research. It combined his love of sports with his access to high end consumer electronics. In those days, having a VHS recorder in your house was kind of new and exciting. If you had one, you you're on the cutting edge of technology. Tom had been in a seminar discussing why, narrowly missing out on an imagined future. Torches are so much he wanted to find a way to figure out what was going on his sports brain suddenly kicked in there. Ah, lot of data points out there of some disgruntled looking silver medalists and one of the graduate students in the class, Vicky Medic, said. That sounds interesting. We should test that to do so. Tom said his VCR to catch the Barcelona Olympics on NBC, so we recorded all of their coverage and then went through it. We pulled critical moments where swimmers are racing to the finish line and they touch 123 and we just followed the camera. Sometimes most often, of course, they're focusing on the gold medal winner. Sometimes they'll show the faces of the bronze and silver medal winner. We would edit those and show them to judges and have them score it on agony to ecstasy scale borrowing, a phrase from an old sports program, The Wide world of sports, those judges Tom students had to give each face. They saw a score from 1 to 10. If the athlete looked like they were an emotional agony, they got a one. If the medalist appeared to be in the throes of ecstasy, it was a tent. The bronze medal escort, on average, a 7.1 out of 10. On that scale, that's pretty high, especially given that they had just gotten third place with silver medalists. They scored not seven nor six, not even a five. On average, they were at a 4.8. Of all the people on the podium, the silver medalists were clearly the most miserable. And on Tom Scale, a 4.8 is closer to agony than to ecstasy. Mmm. Does this mean that the silver medalists who so close to the gold they can almost taste it, think of their quite significant achievement? Not his achievement, but as a failure to to win the gold, the failure to be the person who can be on the Wiki box the following year, whereas the bronze medalist they might also some of them, especially if they were expecting to win, might imagine. Oh, if I had done a little better, I could get the gold medal. But the gold medalist two slots away, one slot away in the opposite direction is not getting a medal at all. And so psychologically, that's Amore, tempting alternative to reality, to construct, and therefore they have a sense of relief that Well, at least I least I got a medal. Tom's finding wasn't just true with the Barcelona Olympics, the agony of silver medalist has been confirmed experimentally again and again. During the 2004 Athens Games, Professor David Matsumoto of San Francisco State teamed up with martial arts journalist Bob Willingham. They ran judo medalists from over 30 different countries through a state of the art technique called the Facial Action Coding System. They noted the exact movements of each of the muscles in the athletes faces, and we're talking all the muscles here from the core a gator super silly to the zygomatic ous major. The researchers confirmed what Tom's judges saw and revealed a pattern that was even more striking. The martial artists who won silver weren't just less happy than those in first and third place. They were in a completely different state of mind. Their facial expressions showed distinctly negative emotions, emotions like sadness, anger and disgust, which is remarkable. I mean, they just got Olympic recognition for their sporting achievements, and their faces said they felt awful. These findings show that the imagined alternative that of a gold medal, poisons the actually really awesome reality. The silver medalist experience. They've just won an Olympic medal. That should be a thrill, but they end up looking enviously at the one single solitary person on earth who beat them. But this experience isn't just a problem for Olympians. It's part of human nature. It's a bias that's deeply ingrained in all of us. People don't react to the stimuli they confront. They react to the meaning that they attached to the stimulus. Second place is great, except if you've assigned it the meaning of it not being the gold medal. But bronze medalists clearly attached a different meaning to getting third place on the leaderboard. They aren't gazing disappointed Lee at the chimp. They're looking down at all the people who didn't beat them. They're thinking about the possibility of not getting a medal at all Bronze medalists air framing their experience in a way that is also pretty relatable, especially if you think back on your own life experiences. Many times people will say that Oh, the happiest moment of my life is you know, I was having a medical test because there was something to worry about, and it turned out it was nothing and I'll always remember that day just your air, ecstatic that something bad didn't happen. There's always a worst reference point out there. If you look carefully enough problems, we don't often look. Yes, I mean, it's really a psychology of counting your blessings before we take a break. Let's play a quick would you rather game. Would you rather take a a job where you earned $50,000 a year, or B a job where you earned $100,000 a year? Time's up. My guess is that you went with Option B, but I didn't tell you what everyone else that the imaginary company was earning. And that makes a bigger difference than you think. Happiness. Love will be back in a moment. It's 1981 in England is in the grip of a terrible economic crisis. Jerry Danvers and has Scott been? The specials are touring the country, playing concerts in city after city, and everywhere they go they see the same thing. Auto plants, closing shipyards, shutting down the factory gates being locked for good. Nearly three million Brits are out of work, and 6000 more are joining those ranks. Every single day Jammers hit song powerfully evokes the feeling of hard times. Ghost must be miserable, but as it turns out, you may be happier living in a ghost town than a boom town if you're unemployed. And to explain why I need to talk about the power of reference points. You see, our mind is constantly telling us that being absolutely better is what matters. Gold is better than silver, which is better than bronze. Getting an A plus on your report card is better than in a, which is better than an A minus. Earning $100,000 is better than 75,000 which is better than 50,000. But it turns out the being absolutely better doesn't always feel better. It depends on your reference point that other alternative reality you're paying attention to, which takes us back to ghost hunts. Back in 2003 Andrew Clark, a professor at the Paris school Freakonomics, studied while being in the UK across different kinds of labor markets. Whether you're in a ghost town like the one in the special song or a boom town in which only a small number of people are seeking work, what did he find? Well, as you might expect, Clark found that not having a job kind of sucks. Overall, unemployed folks were less happy than those with jobs. But how big that effect Waas depended on where you lived. Being unemployed in a town where lots of folks are unemployed doesn't feel as bad as being unemployed in a town where lots of folks are working. Clark's data showed that we're using the other people around us as a reference point. Misery really does love company. If you heard the last episode, you may recall that lottery winners, millionaires and other people earning lots and lots of money usually aren't all that much happier than the rest of us. The science of reference points shows why it's true that millionaires have objectively more money than lots of people on the planet. But they also hang out with people who make even more money than they dio, which means they don't end up feeling all that wealthy. The minds of the super rich naturally compare themselves against the super super rich, and everyone ends up feeling bad. You could always find a better middle out there when it comes to salary and that kind of envy can bring out our mean streak. Do you remember that? Would you rather question from earlier? It was about picking from two different salaries, one higher and one lower. We'd pretty much all take the bigger paycheck, but Tom Gilovich explained a twist that can trigger our obsession with reference points. There's a nice old economic study where respondents were asked, Which world would you rather live in? One where you make $50,000 a year and other people make 25. So you're the richest person on your block. Or would you rather live in a world where you make 100,000? But everybody else makes 200,000 so you're making twice a cz much. You have twice as much purchasing power. But other people have still more than you, and that turns out to be a hard problem. The respondents are roughly split half of them want. Just give me more money. I don't care that other people are making more than I am and other people who want to be the top dog. These results are crazy. Almost half of us would be willing to give up a huge part of our salary just to be doing better than other people. But we don't just do this with money. Sarah Soul Nick and David Hemenway, who ran the original study, asked a whole list of similar questions about other kinds of achievements. Do you want to be very pretty in a sea of fashion models or kind of plane, but prettier than other people? Do you want to be super smart or just smarter than your peers? Turns out many people would rather be dumber and uglier as long as their superior to those immediately around them. Our desire to compare ourselves with others does make us do some downright dumb stuff in the real world. And our tendency to envy other people can also leave us open to manipulation. In a typical lottery like Powerball in the U. S. You buy a ticket, your number comes up you enterprise. But in the Netherlands, your feet in the lottery is directly tied to that of your neighbors. This'll is the Dutch postcode lottery. It's a charity lottery, meaning that all proceeds go to a good cause. But this lottery works differently than playing Powerball. The winning number isn't when you pick yourself. It's linked to your zip code. Every Sunday night, one Dutch postcode is picked out. If you live in that area and bought a ticket, you automatically win the weekly street prize of 25,000 euros. That's a massive chunk of the average Dutch salary. But if you didn't buy a ticket, well, you get nothing, Which is kind of a bummer, even more of a bummer than losing a regular lottery and Powerball. If you didn't buy a ticket, you don't feel a huge sense of loss when some random number is announced. But if you didn't buy a Dutch street price ticket and your ZIP code comes up, that feeling of loss cuts deeply. It's not some random number. That one. It was your postcode, and you passed up money that should have been yours when you didn't play. That alternative reality for you could have won a lot of money becomes very salient. But the real kicker happens when you look out your window because on average, 1/4 of your neighbors bought a ticket and they're celebrating right now because some celebrity just brought them a huge oversized check, just like silver medalists can't help but look to gold. The neighbors of Dutch lottery winners can't help frame themselves as losers with all of the unhappy emotions that this sort of envy brings, even though their situation hasn't changed at all. I mean, think about it. They didn't really lose anything. They're just as rich as they were yesterday. But now they feel awful, but it gets worse. In 2005 Peter Kun, an economist at UC Santa Barbara, teamed up with colleagues to test what one Dutch household winning the prize does to material consumption in the rest of the community. How it seeing your neighbors renovate their house, go on vacation or park a shiny new ride in the driveway, make you feel probably like a loser. And maybe like you deserve something new, too. Even though you didn't win any money, Kun studied the long term impact of having a lottery winner. Neighbor, a typical non ticket buyer, has a 14% chance of buying a new car within a given year. But if someone two doors down from you actually wins the lottery, that bumps up your probability of buying a new car to 18% and if that winner lives right next door to you, your urge to buy a new car jumps from 14% to 21%. Having a next door neighbor get rich suddenly pushes you to make purchases you wouldn't normally make. The idea of a postcode lottery is now spreading around the world, which is great because of these. Lotteries do raise a lot of money for good causes. The Dutch one alone has generated billions of dollars for charity since its inception. But watching the promotional videos for these games made me realize the psychological poll of this particular kind of lottery. It's formal 101 It's tapping into our automatic urge to use other people as reference points, often at our own disadvantage. I'm as guilty as anyone of making myself sad by constantly picking unflattering reference points both in my professional and in my personal life. It's a trade I worry about, and when I confessed to Tom cause if I think about you know who's a psychologist, is doing really well, it's publishing a lot or you know who's one of my friends who's like, really beautiful, like my mind doesn't go toe like that was pick a medium product of, you know, psychologists. I'll pickle like medium beautiful person like we picked the comparison. That is some sense is the harshest right. That's what comes to mind the easiest. And then that means Where are standard is the worst possible standard against which, which we could be comparing ourselves? Yes, exactly. And in some ways we're you know, we're gold. Striving creatures were happiest when we're striving for goals, and that means we're setting our target's upwards. How am I doing? Compared to what? Well, it's compared to people who are publishing like mad and getting the great jobs. Those are the things that spring to mind most readily, and that can make a person unhappy. Thomas studied one other area in which many of us do this all the time. When we think of how good our social lives are, let's try some questions together who goes to more parties, you or other people who has more friends, you or other people who has a wider social network, you or other people. What were your answers? All three of mine were other people. When it comes to their social lives, the average person thinks they're below average. People think that they're not quite in the center of the social action there, farther out on the periphery that there's some inner group, that I's having all the fun and they're missing out. But why do we think everyone is more fun than we are? As usual, it's because they're obvious reference points that are messing us up. The most natural other people to come to mind when you're thinking about how active is my social life are the most active, actively social people, the life of the party that comes to mind most readily. And of course, if you compare yourself to that person, you feel that your social life isn't that great, Given how important social relations are to human life. If you think that socially you're not quite up there, it's pretty hard to for most people to feel good about themselves. And this is the most insidious part of our reference point bias. We don't just pick arbitrary reference points. We often pick the most extreme reference point out there. The person that's doing the very, very, very best in whatever trade were thinking of. That's where our minds go and our bias to seek out these extreme alternatives might be getting more problematic today, especially with so many upward comparisons on social media to make us envious. It's a very rare person that posts a picture of themselves kind of lonely and miserable, so you get it by a sample from being on any kind of social media. So it's hard to imagine how that couldn't accentuate this tendency. Tom is quick to point out that all these comparisons are a double edged sword. On the one hand, comparing ourselves against people who are way better than us can make us feel really bad. But on the other hand, that could make a person productive. And if we were satisfied all the time, would we have the same level of Dr if we were comparing downward? Well, at least I'm not like this person who's never had a single study ever work out. I feel great now. Well, good, but are you gonna work as hard? And so there's this tension between satisfaction and productivity. I don't always find striking that balance easy, but making the show I found an amazing new role model, someone who never stops driving but still doesn't fall into that sad silver metal trap. What I didn't expect, though, was that my new role model would be Michelle Kwan coming home with the silver. Everyone's I got such a bomber. You lost in. My approach was no, I didn't lose. I won the silver medal. The Happiness lab will be right back At seven years old, I watched the Calgary 1988 Olympics and watched Brian Boitano win the Olympics. And I think it was At that moment I was like, Ah, I want to be a skater. I wouldn't be Olympic skater just like Brian Boitano. I'm not even going to try to read out all the championships, titles or metals that Michelle Kwan one during her figure skating career. She may have lost the gold in 1998. Her trophy hall is still greater than that of her hero, Brian Boitano. I don't think about it often. Uh, it's weird to hear all the titles. I guess it must be a little surreal. To be considered one of the most decorated figure skaters in history, especially when you're is modest, is Michelle s. And that modesty is one of the things that sets Michelle apart. Even though Michelle was disappointed, placing second in Nagano, she didn't seem to be in agony. During the medal ceremony, Michelle graciously hug the teammate who beat her. She smiled genuinely when her name was called in Japanese. Waving with these at her screaming fans she wasn't as ecstatic is the gold medalist, But Michelle seemed fine. There was no face, no tossing her mettle to the side, even though many of her fans were still in shock. Michelle looked calm and almost joyous on the stand. There's so many ways to look at it, and the way I see it, it's like the glasses. Glass is half full. I always had, like, a very positive outlook. I wanted to figure out how Michelle was able to overcome that envy that plagues the typical silver medalist. How was she able to avoid falling prey to all the negative social comparisons that many of us make all the time? I never put myself against somebody. I didn't want a wish anybody you know, falls or anything, so I I tend to kind of focus on myself. I was not that kind competitors where it's like I'm against this person. During our conversation, I realized that Michelle used several of the strategies Tom Gilovich and I had discussed The ones that research show can help us avoid feeling bad in the face of those imaginary reference points. The first strategy Mr L used is what researchers call negative visualization. The active wondering What would things be like if the good events in our life never happened? Like what if I didn't manage to earn a medal at all? What if I fell during the triple lutz and came in fifth place? What if I never made it to the Olympics at all? That last possibility was really easy for Michelle to imagine, because it almost came true. I struggled a bit a couple months before because I had a foot fracture in my second metatarsal. Breaking your foot is a catastrophe for an Olympic skater. Michelle had to train like crazy to catch up. She almost didn't make it to Japan, but psychologically the injury was a gift gave Michelle a reference point that made her grateful for that second place prize because there was a really obvious, imagined future where she might have been dropped from the Olympic squad altogether. Michelle also had a healthy other reference point to keep her grounded. Her big sister, Karen. It's fun because we used to skate together and trained together. Karen Kwan was an elite skater, one of the very best in the United States, but she never broke into the top play. She never made it to the podium or got a place in the U. S. Squad because she was bested by her little sister at the national championships in 1996 there were two Kwan's that was the Nationals where I was first and she was fifth. Us. Had parents who really instilled in you, you know, for a sister not to be completely jealous of her other sisters fame. She's the most supportive sibling. She's just like Go Michelle. Michelle looked up to her older sister as an example of how to support other athletes. Success gracefully, and she loved sharing the limelight with her sister. Karen didn't feel like a competitors. I had a partner working with Karen so closely main Michelle realized that there is a better way to motivate herself than enviously looking toe other better skaters, comparing myself to somebody, yells it didn't drive me. I have to be internally motivated and passionate about what I was doing. And there's 1/3 reason Michelle was able to avoid those harmful reference points as I talked with Michelle about her grueling practice schedule. It's like ground hugs day every day. I wasn't immediately convinced that hitting the ice for hours each and every day was a great source of happiness. But as it turns out, I thrived. I love thes schedule like I was flying, and I wish I could bottle that because I don't know what was the inspiration and what was the fire. It was like a rocket that kept going and going, going where my coach was like, Can you get off the ice? Because you're really scaring me right now? And I was flying around the eyes. Michelle wasn't just in it for a shot. At some far off championship, she enjoyed the grind, and when our passion for the sport propelled her onto the Olympic team, she was able to see that experience is a journey to not just a CZ a chance for a medal, but as an opportunity to relish every single amazing moment along the way it's overwhelming. It is completely overwhelming. You're so proud to represent the United States, and then you're at the Olympic Arena, where you you skate over the Olympic rings, where it's painted on under the ice. And I remember actually crying when I skated over of the Olympic rings and I was so overwhelmed that I might had tears rolling down my face. And then my coach actually pulled me aside like you need a wake up, snap out of it. Wake up, you're here. You're the Olympics. You have a job. To dio 17 year old Michele's job wasn't to be a bunch of competitors. She envied. It wasn't even to get the gold medal. I want to skate my best before think about medals, being thinking that anything I want to do my very own best and have no regrets, it really was awakening of. It's not about the result. It's about the journey. Michelle's awakening fits with what Tom Gilovich has learned in his study of happiness. He thinks Michelle articulated an important lesson for all of us. You know, life is a journey. It's not a destination. Michelle Kwan had these amazing years of putting herself to the test day in, day out, and that's not an easy thing to do. And she did it and she can feel great about that. And most of the things in life that are truly sustaining in terms of their ability to provide us happiness has to do with the pursuit of things. We're happy, happiest when we're on the journey. Not when the journey is over. Loving the Journey, a Michela Grace that shaped her career and was especially salient during that tough second place moment in Japan. It was a lot for 17 year old, but I think my parents voice of you win some. You lose some, but you realize very quickly that this is not your world. You just happen to be living in it. It's it's good sportsmanship. It's the reality of the world as you'll hear a lot on this podcast. I want to find happy people and look at their behavior both so I can give you some tips, but also so I can get some new ones myself. During our chat, Michelle revealed so many traits that separate happy people from the rest of us. But the most important one is her ability to put her experiences into context, to think in terms of positive rather than negative reference points, or to count one's blessings. As Tom put it earlier. The happy people. It's almost like they have this talent for framing things in a way that sustains their happiness. You've experienced some failure. It's easy to Well, you can recode it as okay, I didn't achieve this, but look att What I have. Michelle Kwan is the queen of reframing. When you look back, you like wood. A gold medal make me happier when I look back. It's not the medals themselves. It's It's the moment since the hearing, the applause and hearing you know the crowd and hearing the ice when I skated it over. So beautiful, I don't know, just hearing the roar of the audience and having that love. This is why I do what I do. We all fall prey to reference points. We don't experience the good and bad events in our lives in objective terms. We're constantly comparing our own achievements to somebody else's, that other person's metal car salary and even social life. We've also learned that we suck at picking these reference points that our minds automatically go to the most salient, imaginary reality. And that's often one in which we could be prettier, higher on the podium, a bit more popular and way more wealthy. And this kind of reference point setting is costly. Here's one factoid I saved until the end silver medalist aren't just sat her on the stand there, still negatively affected by that gold medal reference point years and years later. In fact, one study has even shown that silver medalists are more likely to die younger than those who win bronze or gold. Bad reference points can cut our lives short, so if you want to be happier, maybe even live longer, you need to find better reference points. You need to look not just for the silver lining but the bronze lining. The great thing about the human mind is we can do that. We can simulate whatever new reference points we want. It just takes some effort, and if you're ready to put that work in, I hope you'll return for the next episode of the Happiness Lab with me.

Here a while back I flew to Santa Barbara was a crazy time. I was writing and recording the recent season and provisions history. My absurdly perfectionistic team at Pushkin Industries was driving me crazy. Plus, I was recording the audio version of my new book, Talking to Strangers. The city was nosy and hot. I had 10 Jamaican relatives coming to my house. Yada yada. The point is, it wasn't the best time to drop everything and fly to Santa Barbara, but I did. And why? Because Oprah Winfrey invited me. It is a huge honor to be in the presence of Oprah in person. She's everything you think should be thoughtful, gracious 10 times smarter than everyone else in the room. We talked about what prompted me to write talking to strangers and what I hope readers and listeners will get from the book. Here's my interview with Oprah from her great podcast, Super Soul conversations. I hope you enjoy our chat, and afterwards I urge you to subscribe to her show and here a great new guest every week. I'm Oprah Winfrey. Welcome to super Soul conversations. The podcast. I believe that one of the most valuable gifts you can give yourself is time taking time to be more fully present. Your journey to become or inspired and connected to the deeper world around us starts right now. Today on Super Soul. Sunday, he's been named one of the 100 most influential people by Time magazine journalist, podcaster and author of five New York Times bestselling books. Malcolm Gladwell as a columnist for The New Yorker and hosted the popular podcast Revisionist History. Malcolm challenges Us Toe Look at life from a different perspective. We first met on the Oprah Show to discuss his book Blink, which became a global phenomenon. Selling nearly six million copies. It's been translated into more than 25 languages. In a time when division tension and anger seemed to pervade our daily lives, Malcolm Gladwell once again invites us to turn the world onto its side and take a closer look at what's really going on in his gripping new book. Talking to Strangers what we should know about the people we don't know, Malcolm puts forth the theory that too often we make dramatic, often dangerous assumptions about people we don't know through well known cases like the Bernie Madoff scandal and the Amanda Knox trial, the Jerry Sandusky Abused Trial and the racially charged Arrest and Death of Sandra Bland. Malcolm Gladwell examines his belief that many of us unconsciously invite conflict and misunderstanding into our own lives. I have to tell you, I love this book. This is my favorite of all the books except Tipping point Blink David and Goliath. But this is, I think, some of your most profound work. Oh, thank you. And particularly for a time such as this that we're living in. And everybody thinks the world is topsy turvy and you have a way of throwing over the rocks and letting us see underneath and allowing us to actually see that things are not always as they seem. And now you have so many imitators that they're called the Gladwell Ian imitators. How does that feel? You won't have a few yourself. Uh, I don't think of them as imitators. You know, I always like that. I mean, you've created an entirely new genre Books I always thought I was joining. A movement is opposed to leading a movement. I thought it felt like I was doing what journalists and academics have always tried to do, which is to give us the means to look at familiar problems in a new way. So it's always hard to think of yourself as being someone who started something. I think that's a little all that. Others say that. Okay, what are you saying you started? So all right, I'll accept Gladwell Ian error that we're in now of genre of books. But this is particularly interesting talking to strangers. How did you come to decide that this was going to be the next book? You know, we literally are waiting for when the next book is coming out. It's been now almost six years. How did you decide that this would be it? And talking to strangers was the rock you wantedto uncover. We had that wave of police shooting cases, brutality cases, beginning with Michael Brown in 2014 and I was really shaken up by them. And then I began to read about that problem and realize they had been going on forever, which I suppose is very naive of me not to have realized that that it was on a scale I had never imagined. 1000 civilians are killed every year by police in this country, particularly been going on forever with African Americans. I was saying this to my white friends and we're saying, Oh, no, no, no, I go. It's been going on forever. Now we just have the cameras to show you. Yes, yeah, yeah. And I just thought there was something broader there that the kind of ways in which we were trying to make sense of these events seem to me to be inadequate. And I also what I don't What I really dislike about those kinds of cases is where we have a big fuss and there's all kinds of people jumping up and down on. We end up pointing at someone and saying because we're always looking to blame someone, it's him. Yeah, he just didn't know it was He's racist. He didn't know he was doing. He's a bad cop. He's a people person. I think you know what if it happens as often as it happens, maybe there's something deeper going on here and I'm honored than racism. Well, in addition to you can't separate race from thes police shooting cases. It is inextricably part of the reason why they happen, which you also can't say that this is just about a racist cop. Because it's more than that. It's There's something deeper going on with the way in which we have structured relationships between not just between police officers and civilians, but also between strangers of all kinds. And that's really why where I got to have my book was like, Can we take a step back and say, Wait a minute? Is there something fundamentally wrong with the way we are making sense of people who are different from ourselves? Are we bringing the wrong strategies to that problem? And is there a way for me to kind of shed a light on those kinds of strategies in a in a way that helps us not just make sense of things like Sandra Bland or Michael Brown or Amanda Knox? Amanda Knox Jerry sent dust game, the Stanford rape case it off. I mean, all of these cases struck me as being versions of the same problem, which is there are two people are trying to have a conversation and they can't figure each other out, and they can't figure out each other up because you're making errors. So the question is, what are those errors? You right on page 14? If we were more thoughtful as a society, if we were willing to engage in some soul searching about how we approach and make sense of strangers, Sandra Blonde would not have ended up dead in a Texas jail cell, So she's a central figure in this book. Tell me why. So she's the beginning. In the end of the yes, she's a frame for the whole book. Obviously, I have thousands of cases I could have picked to be the frame for it, but there was something about just how stupid and senseless and heartbreaking her case was. Here's a woman who is 28 years old who has come to get us to start her life and new in Radio Texas. Yeah, in a lovely little college town in in the middle of rural Texas. And we must say, this happened as you just mentioned after Michael Brown after Freddie Gray. If Orlando Castillo, Eric Garner, Walter Scott Now now Sandra Bland, now Sandra Bland and she's a very politically aware person, but she's she's really she'd had some difficulties in Chicago she's moving. She's starting her life over generally arrived in in Prairie View, Texas. That day. She gets has a job interview. She gets this job. She is leaving the campus to buy groceries, and a police officer looks at her and makes a judgment. And his judgment is, I think there's something funny about her, and he trumps up an excuse to pull her over. And what what is What is so heartbreaking about that? Cases you remember is we have the DASHCAM records, the conversation that ensues. But we all hear the entire conversation, whole conversation, and it goes on for pages. Well, it starts out. He's friendly. He comes up and asks where she okay and why are you here? And we think it's fine until he asked her to put out to six cigarettes. Yeah, and she says correctly, Why do I have to put out my cigarette? And by the way, she hasn't done anything right. He pulls up behind it. This is a kind of weird but important detail he pulls in behind her. She turns right out of the campus, and she's going along the ring road of the campus, and he thinks there's something funny about her, so he pulls out and he drives up really fast behind her. So what does she do? She moves over to get out of the way, of course, which is what you do when a cop is driving with you. Do the thing that we're told we're supposed to do pull over to the side. But she doesn't use your turning signal because she's getting out of the way. Right? So what does he do? He pulls her over. This is man. You didn't turn. You didn't use your turning signal. It's a completely and she said, What did I do? I mean, I didn't use my turning signal because I was getting out of your way. Exactly. Yes, And so she's irritated as she should be full on this trump. And so he is about to tell her, Man, you should have used your your turning signal. She lights a cigarette, he says. Could you put that out? And she says correctly, No. Why do I have to put out a cigarette? And then what? The thing that everything goes sideways and they have this argument that escalates and he ends up hitting her dragging her out of the car, handcuffing her? Yeah. Yeah. Where she commits suicide two days better. Yes. I must have read and listen to that transcript. I can't even tell you how many times it upsets me, Maury. Each time I hear it. And Englishness, how is it something that trivial Congar Oh, so badly awry in the in broad daylight in one of the most civilized countries in the world? Yes. And you say so correctly. We see that story we see Philando, Castille. We see Michael Brown. We see all those stories and people just move on and you won't talking to strangers because you wanted us to stop and not move on. I don't want people to ever forget who Sandra Bland is. Yeah, but we can't keep filing these things away and forgetting about them without drawing some kind of conclusions about why they happen. So how do we begin to actually shift from the judgment of others and then start looking at ourselves and asking the question? What role do I play in this? Is that your attempt to try to get to do that? So what I wanted to do with the book is to systematically break down the faulty assumptions that lead encounters between strangers to go awry. So I meet you for the first time. All we know about each other is what we can see about each other. We start to have a conversation. Yeah, Sometimes that goes well, sometimes it goes horribly wrong. But we're making judgments all the time. Based on our own unconscious biases and conscious exact, I'll give you one of the ones that I spend a lifetime on. It was what I call the assumption of transparency, which is when I see you. I observe your demeanor, your face, your expressions, your emotions, your body language and I draw conclusions about that. Um, I assumption is that the way you represent your emotions on your face and with your body language is reflective is consistent with the way you feel in your heart. If you smile at me, it means you're happy. If you frown at me, it means you're not happy, right? That is true with some people some of the time. But it is not true of many people. Ah, lot of the time now I think it's so interesting because you use in the book you call it, I think the friends fallacy, because we've all grown up watching these sitcoms and we see in the characters the the match between whatever is going on looks like whatever their faces also representing. Yeah, so I took an episode of friends and Buddy When you watch friends, you reminded about how insanely complex those shows were like so much happens. So my first thing was, if you turn off the sound on an episode of friends, can you follow what's going on? And the answer is absolutely, absolutely. And why can you follow? Because they're insanely complicated, because everything that happens is on everyone's face. When Monica is angry, she looks angry. When Ross is perplexed, he looks perplexed. And although it way down the line and that's our assumption of the way the world works, we assume that our emotions are reliably being broadcast to the world. Turns out that's not true at all. So I had a psychologist who studies facial expressions, analyze a segment of that friends episode for me and break it down. And it is absolutely the case. She using that kind of way in which emotions of the face can be registered and kind of thought. This was so fascinating. Lorded, Yeah, And what I what she did was she said Okay, it is in a specific subset of a scene where Ross is really angry. What's on his face and the answer is the perfect illustration of anger. And in a specific scene where Monica has mixed emotions, she is both upset at at her brother finding them, but also but also like wants to express her love for her brother. Does her face show that mix of emotions? Dancer is totally does. Why? Because they're actors in the real world. When I was reading this, I must say, Malcolm, I was thinking, the friends actors are going to be so happy to read this because you were saying perfect, perfect execution of the emotion, right? But in the real world, that doesn't it doesn't work that way. May I say that so many times I was reading this book and I get to in the end of a ah and analysis and I go Gosh, that is so true, So true, because in the real world, it doesn't doesn't match. I have a chapter on the Amanda Knox case. Yes, that's the whole Amanda Knox case. In a nutshell. Her inner emotions don't match the way she behaves. She behaved like someone who didn't care what happened to her dead roommate inside. She cared. But she just is someone who those Her inner feelings and her outward expression of emotion don't match. And it started the moment she was with other friends of the roommate who was murdered, and she didn't have the same reaction they did. So they then become suspicious off. Why isn't she behaving like us? Why isn't she grieving? Yeah. Why was her hug so stiff? The technical word for what she is is mismatched. Her inner feelings don't match her outward emotions. When we deal with someone who is mismatched, there's a very real risk. We will get them very badly wrong. So Bernie Madoff is mismatched, is in the opposite way. If you did you ever meet him? No, I never been about God. I wasn't with. Thank goodness I didn't meet him because I would I would have been seduced too. You know why? Because I would have heard from. I would've thought Well, this prisons in it and Elie Weisel. Such a dear friend of mine in Elie Weisel was, and I would have thought, Well, if this person is involved in this person's invest in this person's invested must be a great guy. You couldn't have all of these outstanding people who also care about their, you know, finances invested with him. If he if they hadn't checked him out, that's what I probably would have thought. Yeah, but here he is, someone who's inside. He's a psychopath outside. He seems like the most trustworthy kind of a man of integrity. That's so that's problem number one. But no, we haven't talked about the one thing that's now going to become a cultural phrase, and everybody is going to be talking about the truth. Default. Defaulting to the truth. The reason why everyone accepted Bernie Madoff is because did it fall to the truth? Yeah, this is a really interesting idea from a psychologist called Tim Levine, who I think is an absolute was brilliantly rethought some of the most central issues about how human beings communicate and his core insight is he's dealing with the fact that human beings are really bad at figuring out when someone else is lying. Yeah, we're just all with some extra, including judges, judges air about it, cops about that. It was a few tiny exceptions, but generally we're not good at it. And the question is, why aren't we good? You'd think would be good, right? Wouldn't evolution have favored those who are goto detecting deception? And he says, no. The opposite is true that we are conditioned by evolution to basically assume that everyone is telling the truth unless there is some overwhelming reason to believe otherwise, unless the doubts rise so high that there's just no way to believe someone's telling us the truth anymore. And I think it's wonderful that you start with people right where they live. You were saying, and everybody can relate to this. If you believe your spouse is cheating on you and you ask a question, Are you cheating on me or what? This doesn't make sense or that doesn't make sense and they give a reasonable answer. Most people will believe it. The first time you will default to truth, you will fall to truth. It's our Our preferred position is to believe that the world is telling us the truth, and that's why human society works. If I if every statement you make, I think I don't know she lying through we couldn't have a conversation. Yeah, if that. If everyone does that, then the world doesn't work. And that's Tim. Devine's point is that the reason human society functions is because we have a based on assumption that people are not lying to us on what that means is every now and again, one time out of 100 when someone really is lying to us, there's a strong chance we're gonna get taken. We're gonna get deceived. Yeah, let's talk about Sandusky and the people who end up having to serve time because they defaulted to the truth for too long. Let's talk about that. So we all remember the horrible case of Penn State of Jerry Sandusky, this serial child molester who was a prominent football coach at school. He was apprehended. He was convicted. He's now in jail for the rest of his life. But the Penn State the prosecution didn't stop there. They then went and went after senior officials at the university, including the university's president. Yes, case is still ongoing, but have pursued a criminal case against those senior administrators as well for a cover up for basically of not of letting this man run free on the Penn State campus, I feel very strongly that it is wrong to pursue a criminal case against those university administrators what they were. They were deceived by a child molester. And, by the way, child molesters. One of the things that makes them child molesters is they're really good at deceiving the rest of the world. That's what I've been trying to tell people. It's not easy because if you're not good at it, then you can't succeed, sir. Introducing the child. Yeah, it's like putting Dewey to be put the people who were deceived by Bernie Madoff into jail. Did we say you should have known better? You know, we didn't. I really think that attitude is deeply, deeply problematic. Why we cannot look back in retrospect and and blame someone for the failure to pick out Ah, one in a 1,000,000 psychopath. We're not hard wire to find psychopaths in our midst, one of the big themes of this book and this does tie back very strong into the Sandra Bland case is that we need to be far more generous in our assessment of other people. Yes, we are just so quick to assume that something there was a cover up. Someone was negligent. Someone and not. And I think it's important for us to pause and to understand when, when, sometimes there, when mistakes were made. It is because of perfectly understandable of legitimate reasons. Will you keep kicking the rock and uncovering so many interesting things in talking to strangers? One of the things that struck me was the Stanford rape case. Can we talk about that? I'm quite sure this is going to be the most talked about part of the book, and it was really hard to write about. So that was the case Where happened a couple years ago? Ah, freshman at Stanford, a boy meets a young woman at a frat party. They're both very, very drunk, and he takes her outside and he sexually assault sir. And he's discovered and he's tried, and he spent six months in jail. Hugely controversial case at the time, particularly because it comes is a kind of the one of those signature cases that has thrown a spotlight on just how much How big a problem. Sexual assault. Now he's on campus, and I was interested in one specific part of that case. Which is to what extent does alcohol contribute to this epidemic of sexual assault? Right, because the weird thing is that when you start digging through the case files of sexual assault cases, everyone's always drunk really, really hard to find a sexual assault case where both parties were sober. You mean on campus on campus? I want campus. Yeah, yeah. And so I started talk to people who study sexual assault on campus and people who study alcohol. And and they were like, Well, yes, it's almost always alcohol is almost always involved, and they begin to talk me through the research well, when you drink, and by the way, the way that many of the people who are in involved in these cases and also I won't I won't say more. Generally, the core of people who are drinking on campus in today's environment are drinking in a way that you and I did not drink in that age. Drinking has changed quite dramatically over the last two years. When I was just reading about. It's like everybody's drinking everything today if you talk to. I was talking to some friends of mine Children, friends of mine, who were in college right now. And I said, How many of your friends have experienced blackouts? And they're just, like, done a little every weekend. This guy, we talk about it, you know? They talk about it on Friday night before they go about, we're gonna get blackout drunk. This it's very different environment, and that has consequences for their ability to talk to strangers. Parties are about talking to strangers when both strangers are drunk. It's a different conversation, since this was the thing that was so revealing to may, many of those who study alcohol no longer consider it an agent of dis inhibition. I mean, I underline that because all of our lives have been told it disinhibition. Instead, you say they think of it as an agent of myopia. Tell us what you mean by that. So the old theory about alcohol was Malcolm gets drunk. And as Malcolm gets a little tipsy, what you see is the real Malcolm. Yeah, all of the constraint up tight. Malcolm falls away and you're seeing like them. I you see my true self. We no longer believe that That's nonsense. Instead, what's happening is a little more complicated when you drink. What's happening is you're you basically get dumber. Your cognitive faculties start toe kind of shrink. And what happens when that when your cognitive faculties shrink when you get dumber, is that you get myopic? Everything that is meaning you just focused on what's in front of you. All that matters is you okay? I'm not drunk, Malcolm. All like all that matters is not just you in front of me. But all that matters is what's happening right at this very moment. So only I don't do certain kinds of crazy things because I realize, oh, there'll be consequences. Half an hour later, I'll get in trouble, or tomorrow I'll wake up and I'll be like Oh my God, that was That's why I behaved the way. Behave when I'm sober. When I'm drunk, all thought of tomorrow falls away. All thought of consequences falls away on what matters is just here and now person in front of me. Yeah, I am myopic. Yeah. When you are myopic, you are not yourself, right? I thought of another great example that you used Malcolm, was that the drinking affects you differently, depending on where you are, that if you're drinking and you're at a football game and everybody else is drinking, then it is euphoric and blah, blah, blah. And if you are sitting alone at a bar and you're drinking alone, that the alcohol has a completely different effect. Yes, so Myopia theory says that whatever is your immediate circumstance is controlling the way you think and feel and behave. So if I'm drunk and in a wild and crazy party, I'm wild and crazy. If I'm drunk in a dark, quiet, deserted bar, I'm depressed, so you're at the mercy of your environment. Now think about this and take you taken 18 year old who was full of hormones, who's immature, who doesn't have much experience with girls. You take him to a frat party, you get him to two and 1/2 times the legal limit of alcohol, so he's completely myopic. You crank up the music, you have all kinds of mayhem around him. First of all, he's no longer himself, and secondly, he is primed to do something incredibly stupid, if not criminal. We just a formula for it's something bad, something super super bad happening. And we're not communicating that fact to kids. We're not telling that 18 year old boy who goes to a frat party if you get blotto drunk, you are putting much. Is yourself at risk, other people at risk, right? There's a sense that alcohol is a kind of harmless. It's not harmless. It is a dangerous, dangerous drug. And I think the absence, What makes me so what makes it more dangerous is not being aware of the consequences of what happens. And it's not just, I think we've done a fairly decent job in recent years of not driving while drunk or not doing certain things when you're intoxicated. But what talking to strangers allows us to see is that it's even deeper than that. It's deep that I can't if I am wasted right now, I have no way to really understand who you are or what you want, right, So if we're having a conversation and I'm I'm half a smart as I normally am and all thought of tomorrow has fall away, and then maybe I'm blacked out, so I can't remember anything. People forget. Being blackout drunk is not the same as being passed out. I could I could walk and talk and communicate and tell jokes and wave my hands in the air. It's just them forming, no memories. So think about two people. You got a boy who's like 18 and full of hormones, you know? What does he want at a party? Absolutely. We know what he wants to the party were asked. He's trying to negotiate that with a woman and who knows what is what he's if she says she's trying, negotiate the woman who's also so blackout drunk. So if she says no, get away from me. He doesn't remember it right or care or care or care, for that matter, because he's not thinking about the consequences of tomorrow. Yeah, also, not reading any of the signal's not not reading any other signals. This is interesting to me because when I was thinking, you know, this is certainly not an excuse. It's just a kn explanation. It's exactly right. Not an excuse. It's It's an exploration. So I was thinking that in many of these cases, when people have been blackout drunk and people like of course, you should remember. Of course you should know. Of course you did that. Perhaps they don't In the Stanford rape case, one of the heartbreaking things is Jane Doe, the victim. Her last memory is at midnight, before she even met her assailant and her next memory is waking up in the hospital and not knowing why she's there. It's all gone, right? And I think that that's sort of what made that makes that case extraordinarily poignant. And it's so interesting to that. When surveys were done and students were asked, what could we do to deter some of the sexual assaults on campus? People talk about everything other than drinking. Yeah, which I don't understand. I don't understand how we got to this position Where Drink. I think this is gonna make a difference, actually, because I think it's gonna make people stand up and look at things in a different kind of way. Let's switch to some soul to soul questions. Do you mind? Sure. Okay, what is the piece of wisdom you wish the leaders of the world would use in their decision making? It's okay to be wrong. Uh, just it's fine. Just say I I blew it. That's this. Trying to get a better way. Is there something about the times we're living in now that that's harder, more more difficult than ever, more challenging than ever? Do you think people say that there's something about the media culture? Maybe, but I don't think you know the minute you get outside of New York City in Washington, see, people aren't unforgiving. People are just waiting for one of their leaders to stand up and say, I'm sorry I screwed up. Help me do this better. They're just waiting for it. I don't think they would reject that or get angry, or it just has to be said with a certain amount of grace and humility. I think there is much appetite for longing for humility and our leaders today's has ever been, and forgiveness forgiveness. Yeah, I don't think this I don't think that's something has fundamentally changed in human nature because people fundamentally are always doing exactly what you say. Defaulting to the truth. They want to believe one. That's why it's so difficult when people are shown the truth right before their eyes for them is actually acknowledge that it's actually happening. What's the most selfless thing you've ever seen? Selfless felt, selfless thing you've ever witnessed firsthand? Wow, Most is a kind of, ah, part of me is like whenever I talk Thio anyone I know who's a young mother and I figure out how many hours they sleep. You know, I don't think that Is there anything more selfless than that than waking up there? Isn't there? Is it so So maybe that's it. I go or more selfless than actually being a good mother or a parent. I don't you know, that kind of ever to be top of my list. I think I think of all the things that people have to do. I used to think about this all the time with my producers. Terror is one of them was five kids, So she's there in the office, Same amount of time I am. I come home, I come home toe, uh, three dogs and she goes home. You step in the door there, five kids who don't care that you had a whole day and what happened in that day. But you have to be just as you need to be for them in that moment, I don't know anything more. So yes, I guess. Probably hire mothers. What is the question or the mystery that sit in your mind? This question. I thought I'd just for you that you hope to have answered in your lifetime. And I ask that question because you're one who's always uncovering the mysteries for us. One question I have always wondered about is what does it mean to change someone's mind? I'm lesson assure of my ability to change people's minds, and I'm wondering, Is it because I'm doing things wrong? Is it because it's much more fun just to play to the people who are already in agreement with you? Um, I narrowing myself and just speaking to to the kind of. But may I say just reading this book? I don't know if my mind was changed, but it certainly was opened, and I'm gonna go and read it again because it's done. That thing that you most want to dio is to get people to think differently about something, and what I'm always searching for in my conversations with people is that moment where you can get them or the audience to think. Oh, gee, I never thought of it that way before. And this is filled with that. Every chapter. Yeah. Yeah, but you are unusually open minded person, right? I don't know if I'm unusually open, but I'm open. Yeah. Yeah. So my question is, I had this incredibly interesting conversation. The Jesuit priest named James Martin who one of his causes is Can I get my church to accept gay people? Is there a way for me and not, except in the sense of he doesn't think he can get the pope toe change, but just to embrace the people in the embrace them treat them as any as they would treat any other human being of any other Catholic. And I was fascinated to talk to him about, So he's grappling with this problem. Can I Can I change someone's mind who's not inclined to change their own their own mind? Is there a way for me to deal with this issue with such sensitivity and intelligence and restraint and humility that they will move from? I don't want to talk about it too, you know. I will. I will. Happily, you know, pray next to someone like this on a Sunday morning, and then I was just so kind of in awe of how he was approaching that question and unsure about how or whether I could ever figure out how to tackle a task like that. Well, isn't it true, though, that you could never do it? In theory, I remember in all the years of the Oprah Show that the way we got people to see things differently and even many times to change their mind is not by doing, for example, a show about gay people but incorporating in the early years gay people taking care of their Children or gay people doing ordinary things that everyone else did. And then you see Ogi there, just like they're just like, May I think you have to have a sense of, Oh, I see myself in this person, that person just like me. And so then now what does it mean to be gay? Because in so many other ways, they're just may Yes, where you had the great Ben. If all this is a crucial in really interesting point, which is, you had the benefit of time. Yes, So you took people on a journey that lasted 25 years, five years, and I think that that was they started with you way, way back when they came to trust you. And slowly, over time you must have changed. But so if. But 25 years is a long time, right? No. But does this Malcolm? I remember being in a grocery store once is one of my favorite moments when a woman stopped me and she said, I've been watching your show and it wasn't the first time you said it cause I didn't believe you, she said. But it's because you have been consistent, she said. You've been consistent and I watch you. And every time you talk about kids, you say, Don't hit your kids, don't hit your kids And then you talk about Gail. Don't get her kids, she said. And I'm like, How you gonna have good kids? You don't hit them. So she said, The last time I heard you talk about hitting your kids, I said, I'm going to try it for one week, she said. So I went a week and I didn't hit my kid, and then I went another weekend. I didn't hit my kid and she said It's been three months and I haven't hit my kid and I have a different kid and I'm a different mother. So it's not one thing. It's the overtime, you know? Yeah, you're saying, You know, I think that it's the But you know, that idea of introducing patients into the process is really crucial, though, like maybe we get into trouble when we're just two. We think we can do these kinds of changes overnight. What we need to do is accept the fact that it's a 25 year process. Yes, I read this book and then ended up calling you because I wanted to have a conversation, and I feel that way. I feel so passionately when I experienced something that changes the way I see myself and I see others, which I think is what this book is done. So I want people to read talking to strangers because it's one of those experiences that will actually change the way you not just see strangers. It will change the way you look at the news. It will change the way you experience all encounters with other people. You send this off to your publisher and you had done the final page and brought us all the way back around to Sandra Bland, your deepest hope for the book Waas that we would all acknowledge our complicity in the death of Sandra Bland. That that wasn't about a rogue cop in a stupid you know, small town And what have you? It was about that we have institutionalized ways of dealing with strangers that make no sense. We have asked police officers, required them, forced them, push them to making judgments about people that shouldn't be made. You were saying it, baby, about some of what it looked like, but there was also so much more. There was so much what we have designed this last part of the book is really about. How are these faulty ideas about dealing with strangers affected the way our law enforcement system is designed? And the answer is all the things we talked about assumptions about transparency, default to truth, have fed in what is a match. What isn't a match? Yeah, fed into a philosophy of law and order, which has had disastrous results. So you didn't let us forget Sandra Bland. No, that's not That's not ever forget her. Thank you. Good job, This one.

34b8ed03-eaac-407f-b701-d5a99a5f89e9,The Queen of Cuba,"On February 24, 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes operated by Brothers to the Rescue, an organization in Florida that tried to spot refugees fleeing Cuba in boats. A strange chain of events preceded the shoot-down, and people in the intelligence business turned to a rising star in the Defense Intelligence Agency, Ana Montes. Montes was known around Washington as the “Queen of Cuba” for her insights into the Castro regime. But what Montes’ colleagues eventually found out about her shook their sense of trust to the core. (In this excerpt from Malcolm Gladwell’s forthcoming audiobook Talking to Strangers, we hear why spy mysteries do not unfold in real life like they do in the movies.)

Malcolm Gladwell Here I've written a new book called Talking to Strangers, and It's about the mistakes we make in our interactions with people we don't know. Talking to strangers features con artists and socio pass and spies. It talks about how drinking affects the way we make sense of others. I spent time with psychologists who ran the CIA's interrogation program and the man who spotted Bernie Madoff before anyone else. And I try to get to the bottom off Ah, heartbreaking encounter between a police officer and a civilian, which resulted in the death of a young woman named Sandra Bland in Texas. I think it's a book that will prompt a lot of conversations and arguments, which, as you know from revisionist history, is what I like to do. I'm very proud of it. And there's something else I'm proud of with talking to strangers. After making four seasons of revisionist history, I've fallen in love with a kind of storytelling that could be done through a podcast, and I decided that I wanted to bring that same approach to the audiobook of talking to strangers. Normally, an audio book is just the author or someone the author hires reading into a microphone. I didn't want to do that. I wanted to make this audiobook of talking to strangers as compelling as an episode of revisionist history. So if you listen to the audio book, you'll hear the voices of the people I interview. And if I'm describing some historical event, you'll hear archival tape for courtroom scenes. We have actors reimagining. What happened? There's music on extraordinary song by GIA nominee scoring. We even have excerpts from other audio books and podcasts like the fantastic believed from NPR in Michigan radio. I think the result is a completely different kind of audio book experience, much more powerful, moving engrossing anyway. Rather than describe it, I thought I would give you a special preview. So here it is. Chapter three Off Talking to Strangers. Done the New way. Let's take a look at another Cuban spy story. In the early 19 nineties, thousands of Cubans began to flee the regime of Fidel Castro. They cobbled together crude boats made of inner tubes and metal drums and wooden doors in any number of other straight parts and set out on a desperate voyage across the 90 miles of the Florida Straits to the United States. By one estimate, as many as 24,000 people died attempting the journey. It was a human rights disaster. In response, a group of Cuban emigres in Miami founded Hermanos el Rey Scotty Brothers to the rescue. They put together a makeshift air force of single engine Cessna sky masters and took to the skies over the Florida Straits, searching for refugees from the air and radioing their coordinates to the Coast Guard Hermanos el Rey. Scotty saved thousands of lives. It became heroes. As time passed, the emigres grew more ambitious. They began flying into Cuban airspace, dropping leaflets on Havana urging the Cuban people to rise up against Castro's regime. The Cuban government, already embarrassed by the flight of refugees, was outraged. Tensions rose coming to a head on February 24th 1996. That afternoon, three Armando Sorry Scotty planes took off for the Florida Straits as they neared the Cuban coastline to Cuban air force. MiG fighter jets shot down two of the planes out of the sky, killing all four people aboard. The response to the attack was immediate. United States Security Council passed a resolution denouncing the Cuban government. Ah grave. President Clinton held a press conference, ladies and Gentlemen, I have just been briefed by the national security advisor on the shooting down today in broad daylight, two American civilian airplanes by Cuban military aircraft. The Cuban emigre population in Miami was furious. The two planes have been shot down in international airspace, making the incident tantamount to an act of war. The radio chatter among the Cuban pilots was released to the press way Hit him Kahane's We hit him, We retired them. Go, Honus, we hit the fuckers marked the place where we retired them. This one won't fuck with us anymore. And then after one of the MiG zeroed in on the second Cessna Homeland or Death, you bastards! But in the midst of the controversy, the story suddenly shifted. A retired U. S rear admiral named Eugene Carroll gave an interview to CNN. Carol was an influential figure inside Washington. He had formerly served as director of all U. S. Armed forces in Europe with 7000 weapons at his disposal just before the Armando salary. Scott, they shoot down, Carol said. He and a small group of military analysts have met with top Cuban officials. CNN's Catherine Callaway interviewed Carol to try and make sense of it all. Admiral, can you tell me what happened on your trip to Cuba, who you spoke with in what you were told thing Carroll says We were hosted by the Ministry of Defense. General Russel is Del Toro. We traveled around, inspected Cuban bases, Cuban schools there, partially completed nuclear power plant, and so on. In long discussions with General Gonzales Del Toro and his staff, the question came up about these over flights from U. S aircraft, not government aircraft, but private airplanes operating out of Miami. They asked us what would happen if we shot one of those down. We can. You know, Carol says he interpreted that question from his Cuban hosts as a thinly veiled warning. Then Calloway asks. So when you returned, who did you relate this information to? Carol replies. As soon as we could make appointments, we discussed the situation with members of the State Department and members of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency. The D. A is the third arm of the foreign intelligence triumvirate in the U. S. Government, along with the C. I. A and the National Security Agency. If Carole had met with the State Department and the D I A. He had delivered the Cuban warning about as high up in the American government as you could go. And did the State Department and the D A. Take those warnings to heart? Do they step in and stop Karmanos El Rey Scotty from continuing their reckless forays into Cuban airspace? Obviously not. Carol's comments ricocheted around Washington D. C. Policy circles. This was an embarrassing revelation. The Cuban shoot down happened on February 24th. Carol's warnings to the State Department and D A were delivered. On February 23rd a prominent Washington insider met with US officials the day before the crisis explicitly warned them that the Cubans had lost patients with Armando Celery Scotty and his warning was ignored. What began as a Cuban atrocity was now transformed into a story about American diplomatic incompetence. By February 25th when Carroll spoke with CNN, it's clear this perception had already sunk in. Fidel Castro wasn't being invited onto CNN to defend himself, but he didn't need to be. He had a rear admiral making his case. Does anything about Admiral Carol and the Cuban shootdowns strike you as odd There are an awful lot of coincidences here. First, the Cubans plan a deliberate, murderous attack on U. S. Citizens flying an international airspace. Second, it just so happens that the day before the attack, a prominent military insider delivers a stern warning to U. S officials about the possibility of exactly that action. And third, that warning for two honestly puts that same official the day after the attack in a position to make the Cuban case on one of the world's most respected news networks. The timing of those three events is a little too perfect, isn't it? If you were a public relations firm trying to mute the fallout from a very controversial action, that's exactly how you'd scripted. Have a seemingly neutral expert available right away to say, I warn them, This is what a military counter intelligence analysts named Reg Brown thought. In the days after the incident, Brown worked on the Latin American desk of the Defense Intelligence Agency. His job was to understand the ways in which the Cuban intelligence service's were trying to influence American military operations. His business, in other words, was to be alert to the kinds of nuances subtleties and unexplained coincidences that the rest of us ignore. And Brown couldn't shake the feeling that somehow the Cubans had orchestrated the whole crisis. It turned out, for example, that the Cubans had a source inside are Mona's all right? Scotty? A pilot named Juan Pablo Roque, Eh? On the day before the attack, Rocca had disappeared and resurfaced at Castro's side in Havana. Clear okay, told his bosses back home that Hermanos el Rey Scott they had something planned for the 24th. That made it very difficult for Brown to imagine that the date of the Carol briefing had been chosen by chance for maximum public relations impact. The Cubans would want their warning delivered the day before. Wouldn't day that way. The State Department and the D A couldn't wiggle out of the problem by saying that the warning was vague or long ago. Carol's words were right in front of them on the day the pilots took off from Miami. So who arranged that meeting? Brown wondered, who picked February 23rd. He did some digging, and the name he came up with startled him. It was a colleague of his two d i a. A Cuba expert named Ana Belen Montes. Anna Montez was a star. She'd been selected repeatedly for promotions and special career opportunities, showered with accolades and bonuses. Her reviews were glowing. She had come to the d. A from the Department of Justice, and in his recommendation, one of her former supervisors described her as the best employee he had ever had. She once got a medal from George Tenant, the director of the C. I. A. Her nickname. Inside the intelligence community was the queen of Cuba. Weeks passed. Brown agonized to accuse a colleague of treachery on the basis of such semi paranoid speculation was an awfully big step, especially when the colleague was someone of Montas stature. Finally, Brown made up his mind, taking his suspicions to a D. I. A counter intelligence officer named Scott Carmichael taking over, and we walked in the neighborhood for a while. This is Carmichael talking about his first meeting with Reg Brown, and I think it was during my lunch hour here. Herbie got two tomatoes. I also listening to him say, Oh, God, I drink in his hand saying, I don't want to do the work for you slowly, Carmichael drew him out. Bonehead Maur, Evidence Hid, written a report in the late 19 eighties detail in the involvement of senior Cuban officials, an international drug smuggling. He identified specific Cuban seeing Cuban office, including the General Arms, as unless officers were directly involved and then provide specifics. I mean, flights, the dates, times, places who did one home, whole enchilada. Then, a few days before Brown's report was released, the Cubans rounded up everyone had mentioned in his investigation, executed a number of them and issued a public denial. There was a leak. It made Reg Brown paranoid in 1994 to Cuban intelligence officers had defected and told a similar story. Three Cubans had someone high inside American intelligence, So what was he to think? Brown said. The Carmichael Didn't he have reason to be suspicious? Then he told Carmichael the other thing that had happened. Junior Mona's Elroy Scotty Crisis Mont. Has worked at the D. A's office on Bolling Air Force Base in the Anacostia section of Washington, D. C. When the planes were shot down, she was called into the Pentagon. If you were one of the government's leading Cuba experts, you would need it at the scene. The shoot down happened on a Saturday following evening. Brown happened to telephone asking for Montez, he said. Some woman answered the phone and told him that Anna had left, Carmichael says. Earlier in the day, Montez had gotten a phone call, and afterwards she'd been agitated. Then she told everyone in the situation room that she was tired, but there was nothing going on that she was going home. Reggie was just absolutely incredible. This is just so counter to our culture that he couldn't you. Everybody understands that when the questions occurs, you're called in because you have some expertise and add to the scene. Make Fossas here. Scott Carmichael starts thumping to make his point. The Pentagon. You're available until you're distressed. This is just understood, You know, if somebody that little calls you man because I was suddenly North Korean War, its initial in San Francisco, you don't just decide to leave. When you get tired, hungry, everybody hears you. And she did that and rose just in Reg Brown's thinking. If Montez really worked for the Cubans, they would have been desperate to hear from her. They would want to know what was happening in the situation room. Did she have a meeting that night with her handler? It was all a bit far fetched, which is why Brown was so conflicted. But there were Cuban spies. He knew that. And here was this woman taking a personal phone call and heading out the door in the middle of what was for a Cuba specialist just about the biggest crisis in a generation. And on top of that, she's the one who would arrange the awfully convenient Admiral Carol briefing. Brown told Carmichael that the Cubans had wanted to shoot down one of the Hermanos El Rey Scott A plane's for years, but they hadn't because they knew what a provocation that would be. It might service the excuse the United States needed to depose Fidel Castro or launch an invasion to the Cubans. It wasn't worth it. Unless, that is, they could figure out some way to turn public opinion in their favor. Actually, he looked at that one. Holy shit. I'm looking at a Cuban counterintelligence influence out Spin a story, and I was the one who led the effort to me with that Harold won the hell's it'll months passed, Brown persisted. Finally, Scott Carmichael pulled Montez file. She had passed her most recent polygraph with flying colors. She didn't have a secret drinking problem or unexplained sums in her bank account. She had no red flags. After I reviewed the security file of the personnel file on her, I thought, Reg, way off, Ace, here. This woman is like she's gonna be the next director of intelligence for Dean cheese. Jesus, Fabulous. He knew that in order to justify an investigation on the basis of speculation, he had to be meticulous. Reg Brown, he said, was coming apart. He had to satisfy brown suspicions one way or another, as he put it, to document the living shit out of everything. Because if word got out that Montez was under suspicion, I knew I was gonna be facing a shitstorm. Carmichael called Montez in. They met in a conference room at Bolling Air Force Base. She was attractive, intelligent, slender, was short hair and sharp, almost severe features. Carmichael thought to himself. This woman is impressive. She sat down. She was sitting like almost next to me about that. Here, comical holds his hands three feet apart. Same type of people anything, and she crossed her legs. I don't think that student on purpose didn't you just get comfortable? I happen to be a lame man. She she I mean, I like like I know that I glanced. He asked her about the Admiral Carol meeting. She had an answer. It wasn't her idea at all. The son of someone she knew a d a had a company Carol to Cuba and she'd gotten a call afterward. I know his dad is dead called me and he said, Hey, you know, if you want the latest scoop, I'm You should go see Admiral Carol. And so I just called up Admiral Carol and we looked at our schedules and decide 0.30. February was the most convenient date. They were spoken us, and that was it. As it turned out, Carmichael knew the DEA employees she was talking about. He told her that he was gonna call him up and corroborate her story, and she said, Please do So what happened with the phone call in the situation room? He asked her. She said she didn't remember getting a phone call into Carmichael. It seemed as though she was being honest in a bit of crazy, hectic day nine months before. What about leaving early? She said, Well, yeah, I did leave right away. She's admitting that if you're not, then I am stuff. Which Mike? It was suspicious. Yeah, I did leave early that day. Just, you know, it was on a Sunday. Cafeterias were closed. Very picky eater. I have allergies, so I don't eat stuff out of any machines. Cathy around six o'clock morning about baseball tonight, upstart that nothing was going on. They didn't really need me, so I just decided I was going. That rang true to me. After the interview, Carmichael's set out to double check her answers. The date of the briefing really did seem like a coincidence. Her friend's son had gone to Cuba with Carol, and I learned that, yeah, she doesn't value. She's very particular about what she's. I thought She's there in the Pentagon, Sonny. I been there the day after his eye open. She went all day long without eating. She went home Well, kind of a chance. So, yeah, all right. Carmichael went back to Reg Brown and told him not to worry. He turned his attention to other matters on a Montez went back to her office. All was forgotten and forgiven until one day in 2001 5 years later, when it was discovered that every night Montez had gone home typed up from memory, all of the facts and inside she had learned that day at work and scented to her handlers in Havana from the day she joined the D. I. A. Montas have been a Cuban spy in the classic spy novel, The Secret Agent is slippery and devious were Hoodwinked by the brilliance of the enemy. That was the way many CIA insiders explained away Florentino SP ago's revelations. Castro is a genius. The agents were brilliant actors. In truth, however, the most dangerous spies are rarely diabolical. Aldrich Ames may be the most damaging trader in American history, had mediocre performance reviews a drinking problem and didn't even try to hide all the money he was getting from the Soviet Union for his spying. Anna Montez was scarcely any better. Right before she was arrested, the D I. A. Found the code she used to send her dispatches to Havana. Where did they find those codes in her purse, and in her apartment she had a short wave radio in a shoe box in her closet. Brian Mattel, the CIA Cuba specialist who witnessed the SP Aga disaster New Month as well. He used to work as something called a national intelligence officer and I Oh, she used to sit across the table from me at meetings of that I convened. But I was in Ohio, you know, I would try to engage her, and she would always give me these strange reactions. When I was trying to pin her down in some of these meetings that I could beat, try to pin her down on, you know, what do you What do you think is infidel? What do you think Fidel's motives are? But this, you know, she would fumble, You know, she gets a retrospective retrospective, the deer with the headlights in his eyes. Uh, she, uh, she blocked, you know, she would even, you know, even physically show, which was, you know, some kind of reactions that caused me to think up. She's nervous because she's just such a terrible analyst. She doesn't know what to say. One year later, hotel says Montez was accepted into the CIA's Distinguished Analyst program, a research sabbatical available to intelligence officers from across the government. Where did she ask to go? Cuba, Of course. She went to Cuba funded by this program. Can you imagine if you were a Cuban spy trying to conceal your intentions? Would you request a paid sabbatical in Havana? Patel was speaking almost 20 years after it happened, but the brazenness of her behavior still astounded him. She went to Cuba as a C I. A distinguished intelligence animist, of course, that would delighted to have her, especially on my nickel. And I'm sure that they gave her all kinds of clandestine tradecraft training while she was there, I suspect can prove, But I'm pretty sure she met with Fidel Fidel Love to meet with his his principal agency, love to meet with, to encourage them to congratulate them, to revel in the success that we're having together against get against the CIA. When Montez came back to the Pentagon, she wrote a paper in which she didn't even bother to hide her biases. There should have been all kinds of red flags raised and guns that went off when her paper was read by her supervisors because she said things about the Cuban military that makes absolutely no sense, except from their point of view. But did anyone raise those red flags? Hotel says he never once suspected she was a spy. On the contrary, there were CIA officers of my rank or close to my rank, who thought she was the best Cuban analyst there. Waas. I never trusted her, but for the wrong reasons. And it's one of my great regrets. Uh, I've always believed I was convinced that she was a terrible analyst on Cuba. Welsh Iwas Wasn't she objectively because she wasn't working for us? She was working for, but I never connected the dots. No, did anyone else? Ana Montes had a younger brother named Tito, who was an FBI agent. He had no idea Monty's. His sister was also an FBI agent who in fact, played a key role in exposing a ring of Cuban spies in Miami. She had no idea Montez, his boyfriend, worked for the Pentagon as well. His specialty, believe it or not, was Latin American intelligence. His job was to go up against spies like his girlfriend. He had no idea. When Montez was finally arrested, the chief of her section called her co workers together and told them the news. People started crying in disbelief. The D I A. Had psychologists lined up to provide unsightly counseling. Service is her supervisor was devastated. None of them had any idea. In her cubicle, she had a quotation from Shakespeare's Henry, the fifth taped to her wall at eye level For all the world to see. The king hath note of all that they intend by interception, which they dream not off. Or, to put it a bit more plainly, the Queen of Cuba takes note of all that. The U. S. Intends by means that all around her do not dream of the issue with spies is not that there is something brilliant about them. It is that there is something wrong with us. We'll be back after this. We're back with more from this excerpt of my new book Talking to Strangers. Over the course of his career, psychologist Tim Levine has conducted hundreds of versions of the same simple experiment. He invites students to his laboratory and gives them a trivia test. What's the highest mountain in Asia that kind of thing. If they answer the questions correctly, they win a cash prize to help them out. They're given a partner, someone they've never met before, who is unknown to them. Working for Levine, there's also an instructor in the room named Rachel. Midway through the test, Rachel suddenly gets called away. She leaves and goes upstairs. Then the carefully scripted performance begins. Uh, the partner says, I don't know about you, but I could use the money. I think the answers were left right there. He points to an envelope lying in plain sight on the desk, so it's up to them, whether they cheat or not. And then later we interviewed them asking, Did you? G? This is Tim, Love I, he says. In about 30% of cases, the research subjects do cheat. Levine's theories are laid out in his book, Duped Truth, Default Theory and The Social Science of Lying and Deception. If you want to understand how deception works, there is no better place to start. The number of scholars around the world who study human deception is vast. There are more theories about why we lie and how to detect those lives than there are about the Kennedy assassination. In that crowded field, Levine stands out. He has carefully constructed a unified theory about deception, and at the core of that theory are the insights he gained from that first trivia quiz study. I watched videotape of a dozen or so post experiment interviews with Levine in his office, the University of Alabama in Birmingham, because of privacy regulations. We can't play them for you here, but we're going to reenact them. Here's the first, the interviewer and a subject. A slightly spaced out young man. Let's call him Philip. All right. So have you played trivial pursuit games before? Not very much, but I think 1/2. Okay, So the current game did you find the questions difficult? Yes. Somewhere. Yes. Yes. Somewhere I was like, Well, what is that? If you would scale them on 1 to 10 1 was easy and 10 was difficult. Where do you think you would put some? I would put them eight. Yeah, they're pretty tricky. Philip is then told that he and his partner did very well in the test. The interviewer asked him why. Teamwork? Teamwork? Yeah. Okay. All right. So now I called Rachel out of the room briefly when she was gone. Did you? Cheap. I guess. No village looks away. Are you telling the truth? Yes. Okay. So when I interview your partner and I asked her, what is she going to say at this point? There's an uncomfortable silence. A Ziff. The student is trying to get his story straight. He's obviously thinking very hard. Levine said No. No. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, that's what I need from you. Is Philip telling the truth? Levine has shown the Philip videotape to hundreds of people. A Nearly every viewer correctly pegs Philip as a cheater. As the partner confirmed to Levine, Philip looked inside the answer filled envelope. The minute Rachel left the room in his exit interview, he lied. And it's obvious that so, like everybody gets a start, right? Yeah. Everybody thinks he's a cheater. He is no conviction, right? E He can't even keep a straight face. Right. Philip was easy, But the more tapes we looked at, the harder it got. Here's a second case. Let's call him Lucas. He was handsome, articulate, confident. Here he is talking to the interviewer. Safe to ask when Rachel left the room, didn't he? Cheating in cards? No, no. You're telling me the truth. Yes. I am going to interview a partner and ask the same question. What do you think she's gonna say? Same thing. Yeah, Yeah, he's got his name. Everybody believes him. Levine said I believed him. Lucas was lying. Levine and I spent the better part of a morning watching his trivia quiz videotapes. By the end, I was ready to throw up my hands. I had no idea what to make of anyone. The point of Levine's research was to try and answer one of the biggest puzzles in human psychology. Why are we so bad? A detecting lies you'd think, would be good at it. Logic says it would be very useful for human beings to know when they're being deceived. Evolution over many millions of years should have favored people with the ability to pick up on the subtle signs of deception. But it hasn't. In one iteration of his experiment, Levine divided his tapes in half, 22 liars and 22 truth tellers. On average, the people watching the videos correctly identified the liars. 56% of the time, other psychologists have tried similar versions of the same experiment. The average for all of them, 54%. Just about everyone is terrible. Police officers, judges, therapists, even CIA officers running big spy networks, everyone. Why? Tim Levine's answer is called Truth Default Theory, or T. T. T. Levine's theory started with an inside that came from one of his graduate students. He soon Park. It was right at the beginning of Levine's research, when he was a CZ baffled as the rest of his profession, about why we are also bad at something that, by rights, we should be good at her big insight. The 1st 1 Ah, was in the 54% deception accuracy thing that's averaging across truths and lies, and you come to a very different understanding if you break out truth, how much people are right on truce and how much people are right on lies. What he means is this. If I tell you that your accuracy rate on Levine's videos is right around 50% the natural assumption is to think that you were just randomly guessing that you have no idea what you're doing. But parks observation was that's not true. We're much better than chance a correctly identifying the students who are telling the truth. But we're much worse than chance correctly identifying the students who are lying. We go through all those videos and we guess true, True, True, which means we get most of the truthful interviews right and most of the liars wrong. We have a default to truth. Our operating assumption is that the people that we're dealing with are honest. Levine says his own experiment is an almost perfect illustration of this phenomenon. He invites people to play a trivia game from money. Suddenly, the instructor is called out of the room, and she just happens to leave the answers to the test in plain view on her desk. Levine says that logically, the subject should roll their eyes. At this point, the college students, they're not stupid. They've signed up for a psychological experiment. They're given a partner whom they've never met, who is egging them on to cheat. You would think that they might be even a little suspicious that things are not as they seem, but no so they catch that leaving the room might be set up thing they almost never catches that their partners. Stoute Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you know, it's interesting what they suspect. So they think there might be hidden camps. Yeah, right. They think it might be a self because it sure makes sense. But this nice person they're talking and chatting to they never question it to snap out of truth default mode requires what Levine calls a trigger. A trigger is not the same as a suspicion or the first sliver of doubt. We fall out of truth default mode only when the case against our initial assumption becomes definitive. We do not behave in other words, like sober minded scientists slowly gathering evidence of the truth or falsity of something before reaching a conclusion. We do the opposite. We start by believing, and we stopped believing on Lee when our doubts and misgivings rise to the point where we could no longer explain them away. This proposition sounds at first that the kind of hair splitting that social scientists love to engage in it is not. It is a profound point that explains a lot of otherwise puzzling behavior. Consider, for example, what are the most famous findings in all of psychology, Stanley Milgram's obedience experiment. In 1961 Milgrom recruited volunteers from New Haven to take part in what he said was a memory experiment. Each volunteer was met by a somber, imposing young men named John Williams, who explained that they were gonna play the role of teacher in the experiment, Williams introduced them to another volunteer, a pleasant middle aged man named Mr Wallace. Mr. Wallace, they were told, was to be the learner. He would sit in an adjoining room, wired to a complicated apparatus capable of delivering electrical shocks up to 450 volts. If you're curious about what 450 volts feels like, it's just shy of the amount of electrical shock that leaves tissue damage. The teacher volunteer was instructed to give the lunar a series of memory tasks, and each time the learner failed, the volunteer was to punish him with an ever greater electroshock in order to see whether the threat of punishment affected someone's ability to perform memory tasks. As the shocks escalated, Willis would cry out in pain, and ultimately he started hammering on the walls. But if the teacher wavered, the imposing instructor would urge them on. Please continue. Theo Experiment requires that you continue. It is absolutely essential that you continue. You have no other choice. You must go on. The reason the Milgram experiment is so famous is that virtually all of the volunteers complied. 65% ended up administering the maximum dose to the hapless learner. In the wake of the Second World War and the revelations about what German guards have been ordered to do in the Nazi concentration camps, Milgram's findings caused a sensation. But to Levine, there's a second lesson to the experiment. Volunteers shows up and meets the imposing young John Williams. He was actually a local high school biology teacher, chosen, in Milgram's words, because he was technical looking and dry, the type you would later see on television in connection with the space program, everything, Williams said June. The experiment had been memorized from a script written by Milgram himself. Mr. Wallace was, in fact, a man named Jim McDonough. He worked for the railroad modem, liked him for the part of victim because he was mild and submissive. His cries of agony were taped and played over a loudspeaker wth e experiment was a little amateur theatrical production, and the word amateur here is crucial. The Milgram experiment was not produced for a Broadway stage. Mr Wallace, by Mo Gramm's own description, was a terrible actor, and everything about the experiment was, to put it mildly, more than a little far fetched. The electric shock machine didn't actually give shocks. More than one participant saw the loudspeaker in the corner and wondered why Wallace his cries were coming from there, not from behind the door to the room where Wallace was strapped in. And if the purpose of the experiment was to measure learning, Why on earth did Williams spend the entire time with the teacher and not behind the door with the learner? Didn't make it obvious that what he really wanted to do was observed the person inflicting the pain, not the person receiving the pain. As hoaxes go, the Milgram experiment was pretty transparent. And just as would Levine's trivia test, people fell for it. They defaulted to truth. As one subject wrote to mow Graham in a follow up questionnaire. I actually checked the death notices in the New Haven register for atleast two weeks after the experiment to see if I had been involved in a contributing factor in the death of the so called Lerner. I was very relieved that his name did not appear another road. Believe me, when no response came from Mr Wallace with stronger voltage, I really believe the man was probably dead. These are adults who were apparently convinced that a prestigious institution of higher learning could run a possibly lethal torture experiment in one of its basements. The experiment left such an effect on me, another road that I spent the night in a cold sweat and nightmares because of the fear that I might have killed that man in the chair. But here's the crucial detail. Milgrom subjects weren't hopelessly gullible. They had doubts, lots of doubts In her fascinating history of Milgram's obedience experiments. Behind the shock machine, Gina Perry interviews a retired to maker named Joe D. Mo, who was one of Milgram's original subjects. I thought this is bizarre, Demote told Perry. Demo became convinced that Wallace was faking it. But then Mr Wallace came out of the locked room at the end of the experiment and put on a little act. He looked demo remembers haggard and emotional. He came in with a handkerchief in his hand, wiping his face. He came up to me and he offered his hand to shake hands with me, and he said, I want to thank you for stopping it. When he came in, I thought, Wow, maybe it really was true. Demo was pretty sure that he was being lied to, but all it took was for one of the liars to extend the pretense a little longer, look a little upset and mop his brow with a handkerchief and demo folded his cards. Here are the full statistics from the Milgram experiment 56.1%. I fully believe the learning was getting painful shocks 24%. Although I had some doubts, I believe the lunar was probably getting the shocks 6.1%. I just wasn't sure whether the learner was getting the shocks or not. 11.4%. Although I had some doubts, I thought the Lerner was probably not getting the shocks 2.4%. I was certain the Lerner was not getting the shocks. Over 40% of the volunteers picked up on something odd, something that suggested the experiment was not what it seemed, but those does just weren't enough to trigger them out of truth default. That's Levine's point. You believe someone not because you have no doubts about belief is not the absence of doubt. You believe someone because you don't have enough doubts about him. Just think about how many times you have criticized someone else. In hindsight, for their failure to spot a liar, you should have known there were all kinds of red flags. You had doubts, Levine would say. That's the wrong way to think about what happened. The right question is, Were there enough red flags to push you over the threshold of belief? If there weren't then by defaulting to truth, you were only being human. More after this. If you listen to revisionist history, you know that we're big fans.

Her father was a psychiatrist. She attended the University of Virginia, then received a master's degree in foreign affairs from Johns Hopkins University. She was a passionate supporter off the Marxist Sandinista government in Nicaragua, which the U. S government was then working to overthrow, and her activism attracted the attention off a recruiter for Cuban intelligence. In 1985 she made a secret visit to Havana. Her new compatriots encouraged her to apply for work in the U. S. Intelligence community. That same year, she joined the D I A, and from there her scent was swift. Monty's arrived at her office first thing in the morning, ate lunch at her desk and kept to herself. She lived alone in a two bedroom condo in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington. She never married in the course of his investigation. Scott Carmichael, the D I. A counterintelligence officer, collected every adjective used by Montez is co workers to describe her. It is an impressive list. Shy, quiet, aloof, cool, independent, self reliant, standoffish, intelligent, serious, dedicated, focused, hardworking, sharp, quick, manipulative, venomous, unsociable, ambitious, charming, confident, business like no nonsense, assertive, deliberate, calm, mature, unflappable, capable and competent. Hannah Montana's assumed that the reason for her meeting with Carmichael was that he was performing a routine security check. All intelligence officers are periodically vetted so that they can continue to hold a security clearance. She was brusque because when you first came in and tried to blow me off by telling me and it was true, she just been The end is acting division chief. She had a ton of responsibilities and meetings and things to do. She just didn't have a lot of time. Carmichael is a disarmingly boyish man with fair hair and a substantial stomach. He looks, by his own estimation, like the late comedian and actor Chris Farley. She must have thought she could bully him. And so I just don't want We only do the first time. Just gonna ignore it, Just challenge it. I'm the first thing you do acknowledge say, Oh, I understand. Yeah, I heard that. That Congratulations. Right. I understand you got living amount that and then you just kind of ignore it because of the age of 12 days baseball days. But then she hit me with it. Yeah, and she really made a pointed that. I mean, I had settled in yet and and she said, Oh, but seriously, I gotta leave by two or something like that because I got all these things to do in life. What the fuck on? That's what I'm thinking. And so when she did that, I lost. I didn't lose my temper, but I lost my patients. That's why her between the eyes look, I have reason to suspect you might be involved in the cover of the album. Simple. It's operational. We need to sit down. Montez had been, by that point a Cuban spy for nearly her entire government career. She had met with her handlers at least 300 times handing over so many secrets that she ranks as one of the most damaging spies in U. S. History. She had secretly visited Cuba on several occasions after her arrest. It was discovered that Fidel Castro had personally given her a medal. Through all of that, there hadn't been even a whiff of suspicion. And suddenly, at the start of what she thought was a routine background check Ah, funny looking Chris Farley character was pointing the finger at her. She sat there in shock. She would just look at me like you sure about that life, waiting for me to say another word? Just wait. When Carmichael look back on that meeting years later, he realized that was the first clue he had missed. Her reaction made no sense. I just didn't pick up. She never said. What are you talking about? Not like she's freaking word. She just said So if I want stewed, I picked up no confusion, no anger. Anybody who's who's, uh, told the suspected herself completely in it. Wait a minute. You just accused me of so I don't know what the fuck this is all enough, and eventually they'll get in your face, you know, they really get in your face. I didn't do a freaking things up. City, like Carmichael, had doubts right from the beginning. But doubts triggered disbelief only when you can't explain them away, and he could easily explain them away. She was the queen of Cuba, for goodness sake. How could the queen of Cuba be a spy? Sure, Carmichael told her. I have reason to suspect that you might be involved in a counterintelligence influence operation. But he later admitted, he said that only because he wanted her to take the meeting seriously. I was, and just to get into it, get to the next step, Leggo said. Under plant myself in the back, and I work on Shut her out like that anymore than crap anymore. Now let's get to this. Get this done. That's why I missed. They talked about the Admiral Carol briefing. She had a good answer. They talked about why she abruptly left the Pentagon that day. She had an answer. She was being flirty, a little playful. He began to relax. He looked down at her legs again. Frost, I don't know if it was conscious or what I do know is that catches your eye and we got more comfortable with one another and she came up just a little bit or flirty. They talked about the phone call the day the plane was shot down. She said she never got a phone call, or at least she didn't remember getting one. It should have been another red flag. The people who were with her that day in the situation room distinctly remembered her getting a phone call. Then again, it had been a long and stressful day. They had all been in the middle of an international crisis. Maybe they just confused her with someone else. There was one other thing. Another moment when Carmichael's saw something in her reaction that made him wonder. Near the end of the interview, he asked Montez a series of questions about what happened after she left the Pentagon that day. It was a standard investigative procedure he just wanted as complete a picture as possible off her movements. That evening, he asked her what she did after work, she said she drove home. He asked her where she parked, she said, in the lot across the street. He asked her if she saw anyone else's. She was parking. Did she say hello to anyone? She said, No, it's okay. Well, so what do you do? You park the car and you walked across tree while I'm doing this one. Change of demeanor, even mind. I've been talking for almost two hours by that time on, and I'm almost like buddies. Hey, about that close. But where we have a great reporter going, she's actually joking about Stop for making funny remarks every once in a while. How about stuff? It's that casual. And then all of a sudden, this huge change or and you could see it. I mean, one minute she's just almost flirting stuff. We're having a good time, all of it. It's like a little cute hand in the cookie journeys back. She was looking at me like and deny. But looking at me with that look like what do you know? After her arrest, investigators discovered what had really happened that night. The Cubans had an arranger with her. If she ever spotted one of her old handles on the street, it meant that her spymasters urgently needed to talk to her in person. She should keep walking and meet the following morning at a prearranged site. That night, when she got home from the Pentagon, she saw one of her old handlers standing by her apartment building. So when Carmichael asked her pointedly, Who did you see? Did you see anyone as you came home? She must have thought that he knew about the arrangement, that he was onto her. She's scared to fucking death, and she thought I knew it and I didn't. I annoyed you. I didn't lie. I knew he had something, Huh? And long after the interview. I look back on that and what did I do? I do the same thing every other human does. But I rationalized away. I thought, Well, maybe she was, Uh, maybe she's been seeing a married guy and she hooked up with her married and she didn't want to tell me. Or maybe maybe she's a lesbian or something that she was hooking up with. A little French doesn't want us to know. She's worried about that. I started thinking about all these other possibilities, except it just enough so that I wouldn't keep going crazy. Ana Montas wasn't a master spy. She didn't need to be in a world where our lie detector is set to the off position, a spy is always going to have an easy time of it. And was Scott Carmichael's somehow negligent? Not at all. He did what truth default theory would predict any of us would do. He operated from the assumption that Ana Montes was telling the truth and almost without realizing it worked to square everything, she said. With that assumption, we need a trigger to snap out of the default to. Truth of the threshold for triggers is high. Carmichael was nowhere near that point. The simple truth, as Tim Levine argues, is that lie detection does not cannot work the way we expected to work in the movies. The brilliant detective confronts the subject and catches him right then and there in a lie. But in real life, accumulating the amount of evidence necessary to overwhelm our doubts takes time. You ask your husband if he's having an affair, and he says no and you believe him. Your default is that he is telling the truth and whatever little inconsistencies you spot in his story, you explain away, but three months later you happen to notice an unusual hotel charge on his credit card bill, and the combination of that and weeks of unexplained absences and mysterious phone calls pushes you over the top. That's how lies Air detected. This is why the Cubans were able to pull the wool over the CIA's eyes for so long. That story is not an indictment of the agency's competence. It just reflects the fact that CIA officers are like the rest of us human equipped with the same set of biases to truth as everyone else. Carmichael went back to Reg Brown and tried to explain. That's a wretch. It just, you know, I realized what it looks like to you. I understand your reasoning that you think that this is a deliberate influence operation. Looks like it. Waas. I can point a finger at our say she was part of a deliberative. Just don't make any sense. In the end, he says, he just had to close out the case. Four years after Scott Carmichael's interview with Anna Montas, one of his colleagues, the D. I. A. Met, an analyst for the National Security Agency, at an interagency meeting. The NSA is 1/3 arm of the U. S. Intelligence network along with the C I A and the D I. A. They are the code breakers, and the analysts said that her agency had had some success with the codes that the Cubans were using to communicate with their agents. The codes were long rows of numbers broadcast a regular intervals over shortwave radio, and the NSA had managed to decode a few snippets. They've given the list of tidbits to the FBI two and 1/2 years before but had heard nothing back Out of frustration, the NSA analysts decided to share a few details with her d. I, a counterpart. The Cubans had a highly placed spy in Washington whom they called agent S, she said. Agent s had an interest in something called a safe system. And Agent s had apparently visited the American base at Guantanamo Bay in the two week time frame. From July 4th, July 18th 1996. Demand from the D. A was alarmed. Safe was the name of the D. A's internal computer messaging archive that strongly suggested that agent s was at the D. I A or least closely affiliated with the D. I A. He came back and told his supervisors they took Carmichael. He was angry. So what? 25 years? How many D employees have gone under? You never open up, you know, told me the freaking case. I'd be. I am both motherfuckers. He was the D. A's counterintelligence investigator. He knew exactly what he had to do. A search of the D A computer system. Any Department of Defense employee who travels to Guantanamo Bay needs to get approval. They need to send two messages through the Pentagon system, asking first for permission to travel and then for permission to talk to whomever they wish to interview at the base. Okay, so two messages. Carmichael said he guessed that the earliest anyone traveling to Guantanamo Bay in July would apply for their clearances was April. So he had his search parameters, travel authority and security clearance requests from D I. A employees regarding Guantanamo Bay May. Between April 1st and July 18th 1996 he told his co worker, Gator Johnson, to run the same search simultaneously. Two heads will be better than one. They began searching to the safe system like that. I'm gonna go through this real quick and just see if something jumps on it, and that's when it hit. That's when I had pretty sure was 24 hit me. It was gonna be mindless. Game was fucking over. I mean, it was over a hurt. I was really stunned. Speechless stuff. I could have thought of it. I literally backed up your homes on wheels. I was literally distancing myself from this. Carmichael said, Oh, shit. Thank you for listening to Chapter three of talking to strangers. What we should know about the people we don't know.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, Episode 10 of Revisionist History The Way In the second half of the 20th century, a group of scientists became obsessed with an obscure family of viruses. There weren't many people in the obscure virus club. They all knew each other. The rest of the world rolled its eyes. That thumb read the letter. Okay, Dear Bob, I regret that your paper on the T sold retrovirus is not acceptable for publication in the Journal of Virology, Exhibit A in the archives of the obscure virus club are rejection letter. I completely agree with reviewer number one. There's little point of perpetuating this controversy about the presumed viral nature of this material, not thank you very much. This is fascinating, but you're not quite there yet. Just No, I hope you understand. We can only accept definitive data to resolve this question. Therefore, have no alternative but to reject his paper outright on advise you we cannot consider the present manuscript in any form in any form. If you are in the obscure virus club, you got this a lot. It didn't stop them. Thank God. My name is Malcolm Gladwell. You're listening to revisionist history, My podcast about things overlooked and misunderstood. Thing is the final episode of season for a season of Jesuits and lawyers and Gangsters and disputatious musicians, iconic class and skeptics. And I want to finish with the story of the obscure virus club may be the biggest band of iconoclasts of all. This is a bedtime story for this season of revisionist history. And as with any story, you have to wait to the very end to understand what it's all about. The obscure virus club had add junk members honorary members hangers on, but I want to focus on the three people at its core. Ludwik Gross, Howard Temin Robert Gallo. Bob Gallo is the only one still alive. 82 years old, still at the office every day. He has pictures of his old compatriots on his walls. I think he sent this to me. No, they're his life. Yeah, okay, this is just, you know, unforgettable character. But that captures, you know? Yeah. First. Ludwik Gross, head of cancer research for the Veterans Administration in the Bronx. Gallo remembers asking him whether he wanted to get rich. Gross told him no, he had everything he needed and he counted it off. First he had his car hit escape Poland in his car after the Nazis invaded you drove everywhere. When he came to see me at N. I. H. Drove from New York. His first experiments were in the backseat. Trump, where is called? So he said, Number two. I have my television liken. See, Perry Mason was a cremation attic number three. I have my work, and therefore every way that's That's little Crow's. A scientific meetings In the 19 fifties, people wouldn't sit next to look. Vic Gross. Everyone thought he was crazy. Next came the ringleader of the obscure virus club, Howard Timon, The remarkable Howard Timon. Really? We can do the attention. It's something. I can do it right now. You get self conscious. Yeah. Vernon, where are the controls? You don't have any damn controls than you're making too many cleans with hair like you. The same hairdo. Howard Temin, Ludwik Gross. Robert Gallo. And what did they have in common? E mean, what's in common? We got pissed on. We all had our time for, I would say, three scientists shunned by their peers. That was the price of admission to the obscure virus club. In 1911 a young physician named Francis Payton Rouse set up a cancer research laboratory in New York at what is now Rockefeller University. A woman came to see Rouse. She had a poultry farm just outside the city, and she brought with her a hand with a large lump on its chest. The lump was cancer, a sarcoma that is a tumor of the connective tissue. We don't know why a cancer doctor would be curious about a dying chicken, but he waas rows removed the tumor, grounded up, mixed it with saline solution and injected the solution into healthy chickens. And what happened? Healthy chickens developed the same tumors. Russ was perplexed. Cancer is not supposed to be a communicable disease. It's caused by a malfunction of the genetic machinery inside a cell. It can't be passed from one person to another, like the flu. But this is exactly what seemed to be happening. The chicken's tumor, Rose concluded, had to be caused by a virus. People didn't believe him. They said. Well, maybe that tumor isn't really cancer. Or so what? This is just some weird thing that happens with chickens, Rose Scott discouraged. He stopped working on viruses entirely. Years later, this same problem, whether cancer could spread like a virus came to obsess. Ludwik Gross. He worked with mice. Sometimes mice came down with leukemia. Muren leukemia, which is a lot like human leukemia. Gross bred mice to show how the disease was communicated from one generation to the next. He became convinced that the leukemia was caused by a virus passed from mother to offspring. But the same thing happened. Other scientists didn't believe him. Here was this strange emigre in the Bronx, imagining cancer causing viruses in mice. Why couldn't that just be a set of faulty genes being passed down? He proved it was Arnold disease. But everybody's are, You know that these cages are filthy and there's no technology whatsoever. You know, really what he's doing. You know, there was all that my bad mouth completely essentially virtually destroyed. Gross finally won the Lasker Award, one of the most prestigious prizes in medicine, in 1974 when he was 70. In the obscure virus club, you often had to wait your entire career for validation. After Gross comes Howard Timon, the remarkable Howard Temin. Timon was the second of three sons of a lawyer and an activist from Philadelphia. The biologist David Baltimore met Tim in when they were both part of the student summer program at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine. If you had a question or there was a lecture, you didn't understand something you could go to. Howard and Howard knew everything. He was an amazing intellect, and so I spent the summer in a sense, as his student. He was famous. It's worth more, actually, because they said he had read every book in the library, and they had to buy more for him. Um, e I wasn't the only one to notice that there was something very special about this is the kind of person he was. Timon donated his bar mitzvah money to a refugee camp. Years later, when he visited the Soviet Union, he smuggled in Hebrew prayer books. I met Tim, and once, when I was a cub reporter for The Washington Post, I happened to be in Madison, Wisconsin, at the University of Wisconsin, where he taught his whole career. I went to see him. I don't remember the specifics of what he talked about, and I've lost my notes. Would, I remember with absolute clarity is the feeling I had after leaving his office, which is that I had never met someone so completely in command of his own thinking. I've only ever gotten that sense of command of mastery from watching great athletes, never biologists, was squeaky voices. Timmons wife Raila says that when Timon first got to Wisconsin, he would sit in on seminars and other departments, and as soon as he got here he drew attention of people because he would sit up in the front, and then he would ask the most pointed, brilliant, important questions of the speaker. So everyone said, Well, who was he? Who was he? But once you met Howard Timon, you remembered our TEM. In one of his former graduate students, Sandy Weller says she could barely keep up with him. He rode his bike to work every day he took. He never took the elevator. If he had to go to the ninth floor, he walked nine floors, and several times he made me do that. What are you just assumed? I would do that with him if we were going up to the seminar on the ninth floor, Timon could have done anything, walked into any field in science and left his mark. But he became obsessed by the chicken tumor that Peyton Rouse had discovered 50 years earlier, now known as Rouse Sarcoma Virus. And so when I was interested in doing was understanding how that virus causes cancer. That's 10 men in an oral history taken a few years before his death in the 19 fifties, you could not have picked a more obscure topic to study than a cancer virus. People were still avoiding Ludvik Gross of conferences. The University of Wisconsin had a virology position open at their cancer institute. No one wanted it. You said when you came to Wisconsin that the virology position had been offered to several people and they hadn't been interested. How come these people had turned down the position? Viruses at that time were not considered very important in cancer research. They had always been a side show for cancer research. His first office at Wisconsin was in the basement next to the sump pump, and my office was in what had been a transfer room, a little isolated room about the size of just where you're sitting a couple of square feet. But none of that mattered. Timon was hooked. Ross sarcoma was a weird, enthralling puzzle. He began to notice all kinds of anomalies, for example, Sometimes the virus would mutate. It would take on a strange new shape, and then afterwards, the cell it infected would take on the same strange shape as if the virus weren't just occupying the cell. It infected the way, say, Ah, flu virus Does the flu just sits inside your cells, multiplying until your immune system drives it out. The flu is a squatter, but Ross sarcoma seemed like it was conquering the cells it was infecting, inserting its own genetic information into the DNA of its host. How it did that made no sense. At the time, the field of genetics had something scientists called the central dogma. The central dogma held. The genetic information only moved in one direction. DNA gave instructions to or in a which then use those instructions to make proteins. DNA, a tow or in a rose sarcoma was an or in a virus according to the central dogma. Then it was impossible for it to insert its genetic information into the DNA of the cells it was infecting are in a didn't move in that direction. We knew the basic lifestyle of most fires. But now the cancer inducing viruses stood out as different than and hard to understand. David Baltimore, again, what was different and hard to understand about them? Well, the fundamental thing was that they had our DNA is their genome, and yet they were able to establish a permanent position inside the cell and run the cell, so he turned it from enormous other cancers. And so here it was behaving a bit like D N A. He had it was an ARN, a virus. And that didn't make sense. Howard had been driven by that question for 10 years. Previously, David Baltimore watched his old friend Howard Timon stand apart conferences and try to convince everyone else to take this weird anomaly seriously. Why did that question assume such importance for him? Because he was thinking 24 hours a day about thes viruses as he obsessed over the puzzle of rust sarcoma, Timon decided it could only mean one thing. The central dogma must be wrong. One of the fundamental facts about human genetics taught in every science textbook, and every science classroom in the world had to be in error. There must be a class of viruses, like rose sarcoma virus that could somehow work backwards from or in a two d. N. A. It was a Ziff, he said. Yes, the Earth rotates around the sun in an anti clockwise manner. But the only explanation for what I'm seeing with Rows is that on occasion the Earth must stop and go clockwise. And then he spent about 10 years at University, Wisconsin, trying to find an experiment that would convince anybody else of that. And he couldn't. Timon had an intuition. Ah, hunch. But no one was going to overturn the central dogma because some guy from Wisconsin had a hunch it wasn't right. Talking to Mo Catawba, President, chief marketing officer of 18 de business, about 25 g revolution. I made him talk about the implications for my favorite activity watching sports. And to use those two tantalizing words venue experience. Tell me more about the venue experience. Okay, So, um, example of five g coming to life in a venue is you can deploy literally hundreds of cameras around the venue, and so now is a fan. When you go in five enabled because of the capacity in the Leighton. See, you can process the video coming off of those cameras locally inside the venue. Local cloud instance. And then you can give the fans the ability to choose what which angle they want to watch from, which is really cool. And then I love music. And so for me, I'm excited about being able to go to a concert inside of any Ooh and ah, I wanna watch from the lead guitarists, you know, written. Yeah. Soloing. Yeah. Yeah, because Leighton's he is essentially instantaneous. It wouldn't be like you can watch it in real time from whatever perspective you want. Exactly. Does that mean it doesn't matter where you're sitting? So as long as you have five G coverage broadly available across the entire venue, you could be in the sweets. You could be in the club. You could be the even have the emotional experience of being in the arena, which is what you want us, but also the luxury of watching it from your own perspective, which could only even remotely be duplicated at home tonight because you don't get to choose your angles at home. It's better than science is a social process. People within a field are in constant contact. The share notes, the gossip. They compete for the brightest graduate students for grant money for prizes. When you say something that the group doesn't believe, you pay a price, and with every year that passes with you saying one thing and the group saying another, the price gets higher. First of all, people thought it was crazy. I mean, he didn't prove his theory for six years after proposing it Timmons, former graduate student Sandy Weller. And that six years was a very difficult period for all of his students, and for him he was a pariah. They thought his students were nuts for working with him. At one point, Howard Timon wrote Francis Crick. Sir Francis Crick, Nobel Prize winner of Watson and Crick, the co discoverers of D. N A. The authors of the Central Dogma itself, Timon Rights Creek. A letter gently suggesting that an amendment to the central dogma might be in order. Quick Rights back. Very condescending, Aaron. Get letter. Well, I'm sure you think this is true, but you must realize you're wrong and to talk like that to Howard with. To me, that's just such a Most people would have given up, but he doesn't because he's Howard Timon. The word that comes to mind is righteous, which has a negative town to it. I don't mean to be negative. This is Timmons, daughter Miriam, but he is strong moral compass and was incredibly incredibly confident. Person was blessed with that, and so it was not shy about speaking his mind. Yeah, where do you think that what was the source of his confidence? That's what I asked my uncle, Michael Temin, the source of his stick with it. This was an His answer was, well, he knew he was right. And then one day in 1970 he came home to his wife, Raila, full of excitement. He was going to be away on our anniversary, which was May 27th and he was explaining why he had to leave and that we would celebrate later. I said, Well, that's fine, that's fine. And he said that actually, he had something that was a bombshell, that he was going to announce that the meeting. But he couldn't tell me what it waas she said, Let me guess you found it. He nodded. After years of trying, Timon had located the part of the virus that enabled it to work backwards and by an incredible stroke. His old friend David Baltimore, had found it, too. By then, Baltimore had fashioned his own equally brilliant career. At almost exactly the same moment, the two old friends independently discover a little enzyme looking in a distant corner off this strange class of are in a virus is an interpreter. Something that speaks are in a and can translate into D n A so that the virus had a mechanism for inserting its own genetic information into the cells it infected. Timon finds the enzyme in roast sarcoma virus. Baltimore went looking for it in mouse leukemia virus, the same virus that had haunted Ludwik Gross. Timon and Baltimore call it reverse transcriptase. And the class of viruses that had obsessed the mall for so long now had a name retroviruses because by virtue of their onboard translator, they had the ability to work in reverse. How hard was it to find this particular enzyme is that it isn't review? Oh, really? It's really the notion of two days of experiments. Two days. So it's just the idea of knowing where to look and what to look for and what to look for it right? You have to design very specifically designed your search so that it will show up. This ends up right. If you don't looking exactly the right way, you're not going to spot it right? Just like that. The great puzzle was resolved when I got to the point where I knew that the enzyme was in the virus particle. The first thing I did was to call Howard and say, I want to tell you about this. Where did he? How did he respond? He responded by saying, We're doing those experiments to see you. In 1970 Baltimore and Temin jointly published a famous Siri's of papers in the prestigious journal Nature. Five years later, they were awarded the Nobel Prize, along with their old teacher, Coronado del Barco. Timon trades in his two first class tickets to Sweden for coach seats so he could take along his two daughters. That's always seven when he got the Nobel Prize. And one of things. I remember that his pants were too long and they were sort of all bunched around the bottom of his talks at the ceremony. Yes. Did you go to the sermon? Yes, you did. Yes. I kind of remember meeting the king. And I definitely remember a banquet. Um very, very fancy in this enormous wide staircase where the Laureates came down and their spouses all paired with somebody else. So my father had a I believe a Danish princess on her arm. If I'm remembering correctly in a long pink dress. Remember that? And my mother was escorted by some lesser prince person Onda waiters, you know, all in this procession with the most beautiful food. It was the 75th anniversary of the Nobel Prize, so all previous Laureates were invited. There was a huge banquet in the Golden Hall. By tradition. One representative from each set of new Laureates was allowed to speak. Timon was chosen. He stood up with his baggy tuxedo trousers and his squeaky voice, and he went up to the microphone in front of these 1200 people and thank them very, very much for the prize you have given us for cancer research. His wife rail. I was sitting in the audience with their daughters. And then Timmons said, Here we are being rewarded for a work and understanding cancer and your old smoking. The king was smoking. Queen was smoking everybody there was smoking. So they were just, Ah, guess that he would get up and say that in front of all the royalty. Did they put out their cigarettes? Yeah, I think many of them did, because I was down in the floor, on the table. I was sitting next to the Prince of Denmark was my partner that night, and I looked and they people just looked shocked when he said it. I remember the look on the faces and then they stubbed out cigarettes. The story of the obscure virus club could end here Baltimore and Tim in getting their medals from the King of Sweden, then Timon calling out the whole crew for their hypocrisy. Happy ending. But there's a whole other chapter to come. Mocha Java and I have been talking for the past three episodes about five g what it is and what it means. So this something is going to hit the business world first. Yes, our perspective on it. My perspective is absolutely businesses or first businesses were calling and saying, Hey, we want to understand how this technology allows us to drive different outcomes takeout costs, creating you revenue, change, the experience for our workers or our end customers. And so they want to play with it, right? It's, ah, entirely new era. And if I'm a consumer civilian, wondering when this technology starts to move beyond the business world, to the individual consumer, if you had to guess about a timeline. What would you guess? Well, I'd say, you know, the future starts with today. And just like we were talking about, we've already for gotten winded. Waste come out. When did Airbnb come out? When did these things that feel like magic? Now, you know, they weren't even things we'd imagined a few short years ago. The consumer experience is gonna be the same way. A few years from now, we're all gonna wake up and be like, Hey, my toothbrush talks to me. Oh, when David Baltimore and Howard Timon discovered reverse transcript tastes and shattered the central dogma, Bob Gallo, the third charter member of the obscure virus club, was still in his early thirties, the son of Italian working class immigrants. Lean, ambitious, raw, A rising star. The National Cancer Institute. He went to a scientific conference in Paris, was stuck in a cab when he looked at the window and saw Howard Temin. He he's looking in the streets in Paris like a lost soul. November 19 seventies. Now a hero. How are the Euro? Howard Temin, the hero walking down a Paris street would go shopping or something by himself that he was different. Yeah. Okay. I'll wear you wear your E. Yes. There you are. I think sometimes we overestimate the importance of ideas in science. Yes. You read a paper in nature, and it changes the way you think about the central dogma. But what is it that really changes the way you think about the central dogma When you meet the person who challenged the central dogma and because that person is so remarkable, you realize, Oh, I want to be like that. Bob Gallo met Howard Timon and decided then and there to join the obscure virus club. He was a hero when I was a child. It was Joe DiMaggio. Okay, how is the art of it? So, you know, uh, you know, not that much older than the house a bit that came yourself, But no, I couldn't identify with him like that. I just appreciate it a lot. I was just fascinated by I was just taken in by it. And I just said, You know, I listened every goddamn things guys says you. Gallo's specialty was leukemia, cancer of the blood cells. And what drew him to retroviruses was the fact that so many of them were leukemias. Ludwik Gross is most leukemia, being the first and most famous. But soon people found others bovine leukemia, feline leukemia, given a plucky MIA plus chicken and mouse. So five different animal systems, all infectious viruses. What no one could find was a human retrovirus. There was a growing feeling that they simply didn't exist, that baby humans were somehow protected against this kind of infection. The Gallo didn't buy it. There had to be one. Hey decided to focus on a specific subset of leukemia leukemia that affected the blood cells known as T cells. At the time, no one knew how to grow T cells in the laboratory. And if you couldn't grow T cells, you couldn't find her study anything that infected them gals. Lab figured out how to grow T cells. Then he began searching, and in 1979 he found it in the blood of a 28 year old African American from Mobile, Alabama. Gallo called what he found human T limp, a tropic virus, one h t L V one. It turned out the man's whole family had leukemia, too. Gallo then found a man in the merchant Marines with a history of sexual contacts in Japan and the Caribbean. Same thing. Leukemia and a weakened immune system in his blood gala could see traces of a virus with that tell tale bit of reverse transcriptase. Ah, human retrovirus spread by mother to child sexual contact and blood to blood transmission. Previously unknown, most definitely obscure. Gallo submitted his findings to the Journal of Virology, the leading scientific journal in the field. And what happened? The same thing that happened to Howard Timon and Ludovic Gross. The world wasn't ready to accept the idea of a human retrovirus. The paper was rejected. Gallo keeps that letter on his wall. Dear Bob, I regret that your paper on the T sold retrovirus is not acceptable for publication in The Journal of Virology. There's little point in perpetuating this controversy about the presumed viral nature of this material. Oh my goodness and it wake. You could give me the date. September 15 1918 September 15th 1980. That's the key fact, because what's happening in the fall of 1980 it's no, it kills, and it's spreading Young. Previously healthy men were starting to die of a mysterious disease AIDS, a disease that has medical science. Baffled. If you did not live through the early days of the AIDS epidemic, you have no idea what it was like. It leveled the gay communities of major cities around the world. People were wasting away, their skin disfigured by strange lesions. Preachers stood up and denounced homosexuality from their pulpits. Doctors refused to treat gay patients. Public health officials started talking about quarantines. In those early years, I once heard a presentation at a scientific conference from a demographer trying to figure out if AIDS could cause the population explosion in Africa to go into reverse. No one knew what it was or how it's spread. It was a mystery, except to the obscure virus club, who thought it looked a lot like the leukemia viruses they had been studying for years. At what point in this process did you say I think it's a retrovirus Wouldn't going involved in It evolved, but we didn't think it was a retrovirus, so they bite that by definition, the day I got in it, I think it gets the retrievers. The Paper by Bob Gallo, rejected by the Journal of Virology in September of 1980 was about human T limb for Tropic Virus, one h T L V one, and the possibility that this strange new retrovirus had found its way into humans. Now, a year later, Bob Gallo looked at AIDS and thought it was behaving Ah, lot like a cousin of H T O V. One. But why? What led you to suspect? It was a retro vibes. Our experience with H. D. L B one and feeling again, What is that experience? Blunt sex Mother The child. It infected T cells. Check it caused immune dysfunction. Check it. Spread from mother to child. Check it. Spread through blood to blood contact or sexual transmission. Check. By 1983 Gallo's lab had isolated and described the AIDS virus and figured out how to grow in the laboratory. By 1985 they had developed a test for it. By 1995 there was a class of drugs available to treat HIV. That meant the virus was no longer a death sentence. That is an astonishingly short amount of time to detect, understand and treat a new disease. And why was the progress so fast? Because we had a head start in the mountains that have been said and written about AIDS. Three usual tone is one of horror at the indifference and incompetence and resistance that greeted the epidemic. All of that is true, but you can also make the case that we got lucky, not lucky in some ephemeral way, massively, unequivocally, epically lucky. Lucky, because Ludwik Gross insisted doggedly, year after year that a virus could cause cancer, because Howard Timon insisted that the central dogma was wrong, because Temin in Baltimore found a crucial little enzyme called reverse transcriptase because Bob Gallo got it into his head that if they were mice, retroviruses and chicken retroviruses and can't retroviruses, there had to be human retroviruses. And then he found a human retrovirus and learned how it worked and learned to isolated and grow it in the laboratory. And every one of those lessons turned out to be perfect preparation for the most terrifying retrovirus ever known. If HIV arrives as a force 10 years earlier, what happens scientifically, Medically disaster. This is David Baltimore again. The worst thing that can happen, and it was proved in the HIV epidemic is not to know what's causing a disease because that gives liberty to fantasy. We could know it was infections. That note was a virus but not be able to. We couldn't find it, couldn't find it. Remember what David Baltimore said of the experiment in 1970 that led him to reverse transcriptase. It took two days. It was a trivial thing, but only because he knew what he was looking for. If you're faced with a retrovirus and you don't know what you're looking for, your lost, you can't find it unless you know it's this particular class of right. It was the search four reverse transcriptase in the virus particles that opened up the knowledge that it was a virus that was causing the disease. The world may not have been ready for HIV, but the obscure virus club Waas Ludwik Gross died in 1999 at the age of 95 of stomach cancer caused by infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which he himself had researched. Howard Timon died five years earlier, in 1994 at the age of 59 of lung cancer, the obscure kind you could get even if you've never smoked. Bob Gallo is still very much alive with pictures of his old friends on the walls of his office. No, they're his wife. Yeah. Okay. This is just This is not long before he died. Oh, he's so young. It was so sad. It's awful. A Timmins Memorial service. Gallo told the story off his first encounter with his friend years before in Paris. I found a copy of his eulogy. It's like the beginning of a love story. I was in a traffic stall taxi with a few others on. We saw Howard walking alone, and he was poking his nose in and out of the store windows. He was smiling. He was looking quizzical. He was the picture of happy boyhood curiosity retained in a man. I think maybe you've been inside of it so long you miss how astonishing it is. Yeah, that's true. That's true. My life we put it in the mysteries, you know, into something more powerful than you would be or anything else. Or look, what if Damon in Baltimore to discover reverse transcriptase? There is no field. Don't start with that too. I would start here. What if any of these people Peyton Rouse Ludvik Gross Howard Temin. Robert Gallo, in their pursuit of truth, had been motivated by the expectation of reward. Where would we be? Or if they listen to what others said, as opposed to trusting in what their own experiments revealed or if they had only been willing to wonder five years in the wilderness instead of 10? Many of the stories in this season of revisionist history have come down to the same issue. How we should act in the world in novel and difficult circumstances. How we should think about what matters for a profession or think about those who choose a crooked path or dissent from orthodoxy, or borrow the traditions of others or engaged with someone loathsome. I could go on. But if you are looking for one example to be your guide, start with this one. Grace and persistence of Howard Temin and the obscure Virus Club.

In this episode, I interview on old school guy from New York who drops a lot of F bombs. Just so you're aware, you say your name the way in Israeli would say merely a little. It's saying My name is Milly of talent Shmee Mili Avital. My name is Malcolm Gladwell. You're listening to revisionist history, my podcast about things overlooked and misunderstood so far in season, for I've talked about grand themes, huge issues. This episode is about something very specific. A word. The word I'm interested is chutzpah. Okay, I decided I would like to examine the phenomenon of football. Since Milli is my neighbor and an Israeli, she has agreed to help this. Teach Croatian Malcolm how to say this word appropriately. First of all, are we doing? Are we doing that kind of thing in the throat that so many gather all the day after that, huh? Soft. I think we have a closer to Arabic. It's deeper in the throat and there's a lot more contact of the soft power. It's really deeper. Yeah, yeah. So, so softer. Not got a whole but chutzpah. Now, Pop. Know who the this. Okay, so the sound is right. It is deep, but the vowel is not hope. It's hope. Hoo hoo! Yeah, in Hebrew, there's only I e o. There's no Deftones and there's no all and there's no book and book. Write this on Lee Boom. So you understand what I'm talking to myself. For me, it's very clear cause sadly, I worked on it so hard. But, um okay, so it's not chutzpah. Yeah, just like it's not Millie. It's nearly me e you. So it's hope. It's the T. Who now who? Yes, that's It strikes me that there is ah lot of hoops, but in the world at the moment and that maybe it would be useful to find out something more about it. So I started with Millie, and the first thing she told me is that there isn't one chutzpah. There's actually two thehe merican version and the Israeli version chutzpah I knew, but not this other one. Hoots buck. Not bad, but it's not a paw. Yeah, it's back. It's about autism exists, actually. Beginnings. Buck Holtz back now you gotta have the chutzpah to say good bye. I gotta say certain. Fuck, yeah. Use Hit the second syllable. Hoot spa spa is a lot of air coming out of the mouth. What? So when? But in America, the accent on the first syllable. Yeah, husband Who's right? Chutzpah and chutzpah and they are worlds apart and maybe our hoods. But problem is that we've confused the two. When I was in Los Angeles a little while back, I went to see Ah, Hollywood Legend named already Tall Guy. Lean close to 90 he lives up in the canyons of Beverly Hills, one of those 19 sixties houses perched on a hillside that looks like something off the set of a James Bond movie. I had a specific reason to go and see ready. But Ruddy is the kind of person that, when he starts talking, specific reasons, go out the window. I was born in Canada also. Now that know everything about you are born in Montreal. I knew I saw that he had went to Montreal. Then, uh, when my mother, my mother, snuck over the border with you, divorced with three kids. Uh, we took over the border in New York, my brother said when they asked her junior and junior highway you were born. Say, I don't know what you look like a fucking martyr. No. Where the fuck I'm born, you quake? I already was the middle child, so I was the one I worked hard for. Everything I ever got because I had an older sister who was beautiful and my brother, who was the baby. I was a schmuck in the middle, right? So I was always working hard, but I decided, and I learned that they're gone, and it was it was actually a blessing. You know, as you know, I've been learning how to take care of myself. No one's gonna open the fucking door. Someone, anyone gotta do it already way The already way meant going to Brooklyn Tech, then bouncing around, working at a gas station, studying architecture, USC and winding up with a job.

I hear nothing somehow ready, gets the script to an agent named Mike Levy, and Levi gets them a pitch meeting with CBS. This was the mid 19 sixties when CBS was known as a Tiffany network. It was the most prestigious television broadcaster in the world, intellectual high class. It's president was the legendary William Paley. I'm sitting Officer William S. Paley, who fucking owns CBS. The whole road CBS guy had me and my name is that might sit there discussing home show called Hogan's Heroes. Go pellets across a table of Mikey says. I find the idea of Nazis doing comedy shows a totally reprehensible Mike Levy. The agent looks over ruddy. You tell him he blow. It is not what to say is, Oh, I'll have him tell you about it, he points to me. I never saw the fucking thing right. I acted out the whole show, idiotic. I'm jumping up and down. I know nothing with machine guns and Bill Paley starts lying. He can't stop laughing. I swear to Christ before I know it, the whole room was happening on the other side. So he got through and I thought it was like Bill Paley stands up, he says. I don't know if I could ever buy that show, but I said, I just want to commend it that that's why the funniest things I've ever heard. Hogan's Heroes runs for six seasons from 1965 to 1971 show wins two Emmys, has a huge following and makes CBS a fortune. I was not here. I did not. No, since our topic is chutzpah, let us break this down. A computer programmer named Already Who is Jewish has his agent, who is Jewish, set up a meeting with Bill Paley, who is Jewish, about a comedy starring to Nazis. And Paley says, I'm Jewish. I'm not interested. But then Roddy, who has never sold a screenplay before in his life, convinces him it's actually a great idea and, by the way, the lead. Not seeing Hogan's heroes. Colonel Klink is played by Werner Klemperer, Jewish, whose family fled Nazi Germany in 1935 and the prison guards. Sergeant Schultz is played by Jon Banner, Jewish, who fled Europe in 1939. The word chutzpah refers to audacity. This is audacious. Ready would go on to write The Longest Yard, starring Burt Reynolds on Walker, Texas Ranger starring Chuck Norris. He was one of the producers on the 2004 film $1,000,000 Baby, which one? A handful of Oscars I could go on and now, sitting with him in his kitchen as he wheeled his wheel chair back and forth to emphasize the highlight of each of his stories, I realized what already is. He is chutzpah. But this is a very specific kind of chutzpah, right? Remember, this show is being made only 20 years after the Nazis stop terrorizing Europe. There's calm. Klink, this campus are black page of the glorious history of the Third Reich. We're trying to report when I get back to Belle in Paley, admired, ready for the way he behaves, he rewarded him. If you and Bernie fine. We're not Jewish. Could you've gotten away with it? It didn't enter the dignity My name entered. My mind knows that. Yeah, no, no one asks. Is no one knew that no. One There was never an issue? It's funny. Ruddy didn't brazenly set out to violate social norms. It didn't occur to him that there was a social norm to violate in America. This is what is meant. Bye chutzpah, but not in Israel. Hoot Spa is a whole different matter. Chutzpah, chutzpah. You also don't say chutzpa like with a sort of curl to it like a cute kind of chutzpah. It's cold spot. It's like a spa like woulda won an insult. It's It's edgy and bitter. It's not like she's got so much chutzpah. That's a totally different word it has. The conversation, I would say, is like, Is the whole spot like someone who's someone who has no care about anyone else's life or feelings or like if your child is me is rude to you? If I say to Benjamin itself, it's It's This is like a slow as it gets he actually wants, like, teared up. When I said that I see his face was like shocked. Yeah, he knows what it means. Like no manners or no or no regard to someone else's feelings or condition. That would be the spot. Yeah, One word, two very different meanings. And we've been conflating the two. I'll get into the consequences when we come back. I'm back with Macadamia president, Chief marketing officer for 18 t business. We're talking about five G What? It is what it means. And in this segment, we're gonna focus on one of the most crucial concepts in the five G revolution. What is Leighton see as you use that word, Yeah, Whether you're battling zombies in your favorite game to save the world or you're doing robotic surgery Leighton see matters Leighton, see, is how quickly the network responds to a command. So when I trigger a hail, wanna listen to revisionist history that takes about 100 to 150 milliseconds because the copy of revisionist history is sitting on some compute that's hundreds or thousands of miles away with from May with five g that Leighton see gets to below 10 milliseconds. So 1/10 or more, better All right, um, and one way to think about that is your brain processes reality at about eight milliseconds, so the network is getting as fast as your brain is processing reality. It will appear instantaneous, truly instantaneous, one of the areas where A T and T has been doing a lot of work in hospitals. If the network can react as fast as your brain, then people wouldn't have to be in the same room to work together. That's the Leighton See tipping point when man and machine can work together instantaneously. So imagine how that could help bring about, say, robotic surgery. So is you. Get Layton see to under 10 milliseconds and a disperse five g network. Now, if the best heart surgeon is in New York and you're in L. A. Using robotic machinery, they can literally perform the surgery on you. And it's a sight that that's the consequence of these lo super low Leighton. See when the when the automated system is essentially acting instantaneously as fastest thought, its fastest. Then all of a sudden, the job of doing something remotely becomes trivial. It's no longer you no longer dealing with that delay exactly. Let's do a second chutzpah case study involving an exact contemporary. Al readies. I'm not sure how to introduce my next guest. He's a businessman who leads the most colorful life. His name has been in the papers a great deal lately, and, uh, I just met him backstage. Make just to meet him further. We welcome Please, Mr Joseph Columbo. In the late 19 sixties and early 19 seventies, Columbo began making the rounds of talk shows and news programs in New York City. Invariably, the interview would begin with the question of what Joseph Columbo did for a living, and invariably his answer would be the same. Here he is on The Dick Cavett Show in April of 1971. Explain what you do for a living is if I had never met you. Well, I'm a real estate salesman, and I own a piece of Ah, funeral home. Andi, that wasn't meant to be something Not funny. Dick, you may have noticed. By the way, there's a lot of Dick Cavett in this season of revisionist history. I loved Dick Cavett. Anything I can do to an 11 honestly and sincerely I hope so, cause and in a Flores and I own a piece of a cut on room in New York that we cut cereal for dresses. Uh, yeah, it's a cut room. And with all these things put together, I I in 11. Yeah, and I work very hard at it. Very honest. And Cecilia Colombo's media tour was to promote an organization he had started called the Italian American Civil Rights League. Well, we believe that we are the scapegoats. We have been labeled and stigmatized, and I maintain, and I'll keep saying that it's each and every Italian American truly United States that there is a conspiracy against. I asked the writer Nick Pileggi about him. Maybe you remember apology from our Fourth of July episode earlier this season. And what was he like From everything I hear And that five seed, um, speaking on occasion, been in rooms with them? Hey was as mild and calm and relaxed as you could imagine. He was like a dry goods salesman pledge. He grew up with Columbo in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. He came up with this idea of Italian American civil rights. Take their premise. What's that? Italians were being stigmatized by the Mafia, that there was really no such thing as the Mafia. But the media was going after Italian Americans and denying us a right place in the world, and we would be prejudiced against getting good jobs, all because the New York Times could to stop writing the word Mafia. No, what was Joe Colombo's riel job? Aside from running a funeral home and a cut shop and selling real estate, he was a big time Mafia Don, the profanity family. Oh, Ben just said be preferred. She dies in 1962. Columbo takes over the organization. American Jews had the Anti Defamation League formed in 1913 to combat the long history of anti Semitism around the world. African Americans start the end of the CPI in 1909 because black people were being openly and ruthlessly denied their civil rights. Theatre Alley in American Civil Rights League, was started by a mobster upset that the media was calling him a mobster. In April of 1970 Columbo and a group of his associates started picketing the Manhattan headquarters of the FBI. That protest eventually grows to 5000 people. They come up with a logo, invoking Christopher Columbus, the greatest Italian immigrant of them all. By the summer of 1970 they have 45,000 dues paying members. They throw themselves a big benefit concert in Madison Square Garden, starring, of course, Frank Sinatra. They go after Alka Seltzer for their most famous TV commercial, in which an Italian man overseen by his doting wife eats one too many spicy meatballs. Sometimes you eat more than you should and when it spicy. Besides, Mamma Mia the You Need Alka Seltzer. Italians eating Meatballs, according to Joe Colombo, perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Italians. Mamma mia! That's a spicy meatball board. But here's my favorite story involving Joe Colombo. In the late 19 sixties, Johnny Carson was the king of late night TV and one of the most famous television personalities in the country. According to his former attorney, Henry Bushkin, Carson was out drinking one at Jilly's Ah Bar in Manhattan, run by a close friend of Frank Sinatra's Jilly Rizzo. This is Bushkin telling the story on The Artie Lange show. A few years ago, it was on, I think, 52nd and eighth, right, Ah, famous watering hole, and Johnny was in there one night with McMahon, Johnny being Johnny Carson McMahon being his sidekick, Ed McMahon, and they try to pick up the wrong girls happened to be the wife and sister of a well known mafioso who was not sensitive about stuff. Not irritated, you might say. Carson ends up being thrown down the stairs at Jilly's. He's so banged up there's no way you can go on television. Then he learns that the mobster in question has put out a contract on his life. What happened? Waas. They went looking for Johnny, Johnny Hold up in the apartment at U N Plaza. He's hiding out. He takes the week off work. He's petrified. So what happens? Joe Colombo makes a deal with Carson's network, NBC. The Columbus Day Parade was about to come up. It was like three weeks away, right? And no network would agree to cover it then, because they knew it was the five families of New York that was sponsoring this parade to make the Italian Americans Look, you know, it's a Carson's hiding out, and a deal was struck. If NBC covers the parade, the let Carson go. So that year, NBC is the only network that covered the parade cars and what happens the following year. 1971 when Joe Colombo stages the second, even more elaborate Columbus Day event intended to show the world that the Italian American community of New York is peaceful and law abiding. Someone shoots him. That's right. They had the 1st 1 in Columbus Circle. In the 2nd 1 they shot Joe. Columbia is just insane, but you couldn't make this up like at a Great Grants to They could have done it any location in the city. He starts Columbus Circle in the middle of a rally of a of a rally intended to whitewash the Italian American community. Somebody offs the guy trying to whitewash. What I mean is this is chutzpah all over the place. But it's not how Ruddy's kind of hurts. But is it having a Jewish actor play a Nazi prison guard who runs around saying in the middle of the Holocaust? I know nothing. I hear nothing. I see nothing in a primetime television sitcom is Well, it's kind of amazing. But Joe Colombo, mob boss, starting the Italian American Civil Rights League, this is chutzpah on a whole other level, for goodness sake. At the time he was shot. Columbo was under federal indictment on charges of controlling a $10 million a year gambling syndicate. This is not audacity. This is shamelessness, the other kind of chutzpah. Chutzpah. But in the Book of Genesis, there is a famous passage where the Prophet Abraham speaks to God about the moral outrage is in Sodom and Gomorrah. God wants to destroy both cities, but Abraham says, Wait, What if there are 50 righteous people in Sodom and Gomorrah? Well, you really sweep those cities away and not spare them for the sake of those 50 righteous people. So the Lord says, Okay, if you can find 50 righteous men, I will spare the cities. Abraham then says, What if there are only 45 Righteous man, You wouldn't want to kill 45 perfectly innocent men for the sake of five of the margin. And God says you're right. Let's make it 45. To which Abraham responds, Why not 30? I mean, same logic. God says okay, they keep going. In the end, Abraham gets him down to 10. Abraham is being very Israeli here. Israel is what is called a low power distance culture, meaning that It's a place where there is very little respect for hierarchy or formality in social interaction. France is the opposite kind of place. Ah, high power distance culture. Nobody just calls up God directly in France. In France, Abraham would have had to file an application with the Department of Divine Communication, wait three months for an appointment, then present some kind of formal legal writ on behalf of the righteous of Gomorrah. Not in Israel. Here's another example of low power distance at work in Israel. It's the word new and you knew, is what linguists call a reactive token, meaning a word used in conversation by the party that's doing the listening. Ah ho is a reactor token. So is really the point of a reactive token is to signal involvement without claiming the floor from the speaker. I understand I'm interested. Keep going. But new is an unusual reactive token because it's not neutral. It's not. I'm listening. It means hurry up, get to the point. No, no, now is new, polite in virtually all cultures in the world. Of course, the answer would be no. New is not some gentle, conversational nudge. It's a hijacking. The listener is interrupting the speaker in order to control the pace of the narrative. But in Israel, this is not necessarily true. The Israeli linguist E. I'll Mash Lor has written extensively on new, she says quote by exhibiting their impatience with movement towards the climax of a story to the point of taking the liberty of controlling the flow of another's discourse. Hearers can show maximal involvement in the narrative, meaning we in Israel have no need to beat around the bush with neutral, reactive tokens. We're a tiny country with zero power distance. What happens? Tell me I can't wait any longer. In Abraham's argument with God, Abraham talks guard down very methodically 50 righteous men to 45 to 40 to 30 to 20 and then 10 and surely right around the 40 mark when it would have been obvious to any ah, mission entity where Abraham was going, God must have interrupted, Knew I love you, Abraham. You know that there is no need to drag this out. My friend Millie says that since coming to America she has struggled with the transition to a land of excessive social nicety like this past winter, when she was dealing with her Children's school. Like, If I say, for example, you know, can we have less snow days? Like even if there's a snow day like, can't you just leave the school open? I'm just asking. My husband says that spot like you don't think about what their point of view is. You don't think about what the teachers have to do to get to school. You don't think about their safety. You don't think that the other kids much true. But I just want to know the like. Why can I just ask the question? So that's, you know? Yes, let's say you were in Israel and the same scenario. I mean, I realize there's no snow days in Israel, but suppose you're making the same request of the school and I am the principal of the school and your ass. I would like you to ask me, as an Israeli asked me why the school can't stay over more. Excuse me. You know my my kids a TTE home. I don't have the time to take care of them. They need to be inside the school. You need to keep the school open so I can leave my kids there and everybody else agrees with me wanting to ask. I'm gonna get 20 people who agree with me. Do you want it? This is would be, like, not puts bottle. And what it would be very nice. By the way, I just in the principle of Israel would would respond. Excuse me. I'm not working for you. I'm running a school. I have a long way to come from home. Driving in the snow is not easy s Oh, please. And also, there's also ensure lines and all things that you don't think about. So, please, you know what? Call me later, after I put my own kids down and we'll talk on the phone. Okay, this will be the conversation. She wouldn't hate me. She would just like to continue arguing with me. And then she'll tell me to shut up, but she wouldn't like here. They don't even like, answer my email. It's so embarrassing. So we have two very different scenarios here. Chutzpah. That's already convincing Bill Paley to GreenLight Hogan's heroes. And Israeli would look at that and say All right, he's just being direct. So what? But Joe Colombo starting the Italian American civil rights leak. That is not Abraham arguing with God to save the righteous of Sodom and Gomorrah. That is not new. That is not. Why can't the school stay open on a snow day? That is an affront. It's not the I do something and I'm you know, a dog has no hoots. Pop Dog does that. That was not bad. Getting very close, very close. But the thing is distinctive about this is the person who is completely unencumbered by shape. Exactly what shame has. Nothing. Do it. They don't. They're so beyond shame. They don't even see. Didn't even see you to feel shame. It's there. Point of view without any regard to anyone else is left without regard to anyone else's life. Remember them? I'm back with mocha java. We're talking about five G, The next great digital revolution, the revolution beyond the phone. Today, an ambulance pulls up to the hospital and you've got a handoff. Data to the medical professionals inside the hospital, with five G you can imagine that becomes an automated process, which also helps patient lives. It's more efficient, and you're handing off the data more precisely. It's a beautiful thing on Dhe. Then more long term becomes. How do we think through training doctors to become better surgeons faster in the future. Using augmented reality, you can literally watch the best surgeons on Earth performed surgery and learn as if it's you doing it with augmented reality. You can overlay the scan of the patient if you will, so you never have to look away from them and can help guide you on. The next thing you need to do is part of your surgery, and presumably when you're training someone, you would no longer have to be in the room as you train them. You could have access to a wide number of people who are giving you advice because they could all watch through your eyes, right? Exactly. Not long after I spoke with Millie Avital, there was a hearing in front of three federal judges at a courthouse in San Francisco. It was about the treatment of migrant Children detained at the border. At issue was whether the conditions under which the Children were being held violated a previous legal commitment made by the government to provide safe and sanitary conditions in detention centers. The Department of Justice sent an attorney, Sarah Fabian, to make the case that the government was in compliance with the safe insanitary standard. Her principal argument was that the term safe insanitary didn't have an explicit definition, and that's any number of things might fall under those categories. That's Fabian, and this is one of the judges Marcia Birds on this. But sleep surely does right. You can't be safe and sanitary or safe as a human being if you can't sleep well. And you said in your briefs of justice, anything about sleeping. So therefore, there's nothing in here about being able to sleep. The Children, it turned out, didn't have beds or blankets or in some cases, even room to lie down. So birds on wonders. How is that not a violation of the agreement to provide decent living conditions? And Fabian answers? I think the concern there is your honor, the court finding that sleep, for example, falls under is relevant to a finding of no safe and sanitary conditions is one thing. But the ultimate conclusion is safe and sanitary is a singular category. In the agreement, you probably need to be a lawyer to understand what Fabian is saying and I'm not a lawyer, so I'm gonna have to guess. The government's argument goes like this. Sleep is one thing. Safe and sanitary are another. If the agreement had meant for sleep to fall under the requirement of safe and sanitary, it would have said so. Then Judge William Fletcher chimes in. Maybe sleep wasn't explicitly part of the safe and senator a definition, because it's too obvious. I mean, it may be that they don't get super thread count Egyptian linens. I get that. But the testimony that the district judge believed waas It's really cold, thank you gets colder when we complain about is being cold where sports just sleep crowded with the lights on all night long And all you do put us on is the concrete floor with an aluminum Lincoln. I mean, no one would argue that this is a secure insanitary. Your Honor, I think what I'm arguing is that the way that the district were reached, the conclusion was to say these these specific items and I think I will acknowledge I think sleep is the more difficult end of what I'm arguing. Sleep is the more difficult end of what? I'm arguing. You think cold all night long. Lights on all that now sleep on the concrete and you've got an aluminum foil blanket. I think I find that inconceivable that the government would say that that is safe and sanitary from sleeping blankets. The discussion moved onto toothpaste, toothbrushes and soap. It wasn't in a high class milled soap. It was so And that sounds no, that's part of the safe and sanitary. Are you Are you disagreeing with that? I'm what I'm disagreeing with is that the court? The court ultimately concluded these things. Yes, she was disagreeing with her. All of this went on for some time. I would encourage you to listen to the full hearing for yourself. Since if you are an American, it was your government paid for by your tax dollars That was doing the arguing. And ask yourself, How did it come to this? There are 1000 answers, obviously, but maybe one of them is it. Over the years, our moral vocabulary has become impoverished, which is a problem because you cannot make sense of things that you cannot describe and lumping together audacity and shamelessness creates a loop hole large enough to drive a tank through. One last question. What happens when chutzpah and chutzpah go head to head when they meet each other in the field of battle? Well, it happened famously in 1970. Already at that point was working at Paramount Pictures. That was the era when Robert Evans was the head of production at Paramount and the studio was on May be the greatest run of any studio ever. Love story. Three Days of the Condor. Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown on and on, already in typical already fashion, had just talked himself into a big job there. As a producer, a reporter comes to do a piece on him. He asked, Ready after you did Hogan's Heroes. What did you do next? I don't know that that's all. Later that's it puts about. Can I go off the record for a second when you know he said, How the fuck did you get in here? I know guys can't get in that gate of been here 20 years kicking, I said. Listen, now they were often rugged. I had no idea what the fuck collector. I've never developed a screenplay. I did 1/2 hour show okay, on the dumbest guy on this lot at the moment, I won't be for long, but just start writing the article. Still, with the chutzpah around this time, Paramount, almost by accident, got the film rights to a novel by a writer named Mario Puzo. The novel was the Godfather. No one had high hopes for the movie, since the mobster genres seem played out. So they gave it to the new guy Ruddy to produce in hopes he could bring it in on time and under budget almost immediately. Trouble began with The Godfather project Trouble from Joe Colombo because Columbo was not at all happy about the movie. There were death threats, union problems. Shady guys followed. Ruddy around the window of his car was smashed. The corporate headquarters of the company that owned Paramount had to be evacuated twice because of bomb threats. And then the Italian American Civil Rights League called up Ruddy's boss, Robert Evans. The league called Bob Evans and Sweat. We want that movie made that movie made someone's getting at height, so Bobby called me, said. You can see the sky to color, but he's got people are crazy ready, Calls up. The Godfather's author Mario Puzo says, Come with me to meet Joe Columbo. Are you crazy? You don't understand. I write about those people. I never want to be involved. And you'd be very careful getting involved. These are not people you could talk with impulsive. You're gonna get a lot of trouble. So, Nancy, of course, I am not like I'm gonna go tell him they don't even know me. So Ruddy says, OK, I'll do it myself. He goes to the offices of the Italian American Civil Rights League, meets up with Columbo and his guys broke into broken looks like half of them are on parole. With one point of the jacket. They tell him they don't want the movie made. It's bad for the Italians, body responds. You know what? I'll let you read the script. Come to the Paramount office in New York. Colombo shows up with three henchman ruddy hands in the script. It's 100 and 55 pages long. He puts on his glasses because that page, when he sits and looks after about five minutes, what does this mean? Fade in? That's what the screen's black and effect I realize there's no way that guy's court page to its 100 is Oh, I can't really these glasses, a Mafia boss is not gonna work his way through 155 page script. The whole point of being a Mafia boss is that you don't have to read things that are 155 pages. Mafia bosses do not have to do the fine print, the letter of the law or chapter and verse. Those are for the people who have chosen not to live a life of crime. Columbo hands the script to one of his henchman, Ah, guy named Caesar. But Caesar's not gonna read it either, is he? Cesar's not in the business of giving notes. Caesar's muscle is why may think my script going over my debt. Finally, Joe gets pissed off Francisco. Slap them on my desk. The way to say, Do we like this guy? Yeah, I like that. That's not a red pocket spread for so I said, Well, what do you want to know where you live? He said. Would you take the word Mafia out of the movie? What Colombo doesn't realize? Because he hasn't read the script, is it? The word Mafia is barely in the script. It only appears once, so I cross the word Mafia. Joe, I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna take this out of them over. He didn't know how many times it was easy to promise. Shook his hand. I made a deal that nobody could have made you know it, but this was your plan. From that moment on, all trouble with the movie's ceased. It's why the Godfather got made. Chutzpah is a bunch of violent mobsters threatening to shut down a movie because it depicts them as violent mobsters. Chutzpah is tricking them because you're too lazy to read the script. It's so difficult, mouth. I would bite my tongue all the time. They know it's not easy. It's not easy for you to be over here in this faux politeness. I'm basically living 10% of my personality because I have to be. I mean, stuff merely wants to be direct. She's not a bully, and I wonder, Can we even tell the difference anymore? It's not good. It's It's a very extreme. I'm a desert person having to deal with provisions. History is produced by Mila Bella and Jacob Smith with Camille Baptista. Our editor is Julia Barton. Flown. Williams is our engineer. Fact checking by Beth Johnson. Original music by Louise Scare. A Special things to Carly Migliore, Header Fain, Maggie Taylor, Maya Koenig and Jacob Weisberg. Revisionist history is Brought to You by Pushkin Industries. I'm Malcolm Gladwell. So it's it again. Millie. Millie, Millie. It's flat. The tongue is flat. There's no curl. L let let Emily, so that's merely it's not little. It's a little bit of it on this. The other difference is also the tea doesn't have, ah, sort of air to it says that it's, uh so do you hear the difference or is it just me? On July 10th 2015 a young woman named Sandra Bland was stopped by a police officer on a highway in rural Texas. Then everything went wrong. I've written a book called Talking to Strangers that starts with that encounter, but I didn't just right for the page. I recorded an audio book as well, a new kind of audio book that allows you to hear the voices of the people I talked to and come with me to the places I go Because you shouldn't just listen to an audio book. You should experience it talking to strangers. The audio experience available now wherever audio books are sold."
