The first season of the podcast is titled ‘Scaling a Design Team’, in which they speak with design leaders from top notch companies like Facebook, Apple, Invision, and Intercom, to discuss various team structures, responsibilities, and workflows.

After quitting their day jobs to work full time on Hacking UI they named the second season ‘Scaling a Side Project’, and they interview creative entrepreneurs whom they admire, in order to learn about their paths to success and get them to share their tips and secrets. These include Matt Mullenweg (Founder of Wordpress), David Okeniuv (Founder of Typeform) and more. 

The third season of the podcast is called 'Scaling a Career' and it's all about creative entrepreneurship. They interviewed amazing folks who took their creative skills and built a brand for themselves.

It is a rebroadcast of my weekly show of the same name on SiriusXM's channel 111 Business Radio Powered by the Wharton School.

Bay Area Ventures covers all aspects of what makes working and living in the Bay Area unique and special.  From startups to Fortune 500 companies, from politics to public policy, from venture financing to mergers & acquisitions, and even to the lifestyles of those living and working in the Bay Area, I try to cover it all in order to help you apply the great practices of the Bay Area to your ventures. The show airs live on Monday’s from 4:00pm to 6:00pm Pacific Time and is broadcast via satellite radio from our studio at the campus of Wharton|San Francisco (The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania’s San Francisco Campus on the Embarcadero in downtown San Francisco)

Every live show includes two feature guests for up to one hour each.  Each of the Bay Area Venture podcasts on Spreaker covers one feature guest interview from the show.  In addition to the feature guest, each month I host an “M&A Moment”, with Rick Climan, of the Weil law firm and every quarter I host a Bay Area Council Quarterly Update with Jim Wunderman of the Bay Area Council.  

The M&A Moment is a look at top merger and acquisition deals involving at least one Bay Area company, as well as an exploration of strategy, tactics and financing inherent to this exciting multi-billion dollar business practice.

      <p>Ear Hustle brings you the daily realities of life inside prison shared by those living it, and stories from the outside, post-incarceration. The podcast is a partnership between Nigel Poor, a Bay Area visual artist, and Earlonne Woods, formerly incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison, and was co-founded with former San Quentin resident Antwan Williams. The Ear Hustle team works in the San Francisco Bay Area, both in San Quentin State Prison’s media lab and from offices on the outside, to produce stories that are sometimes difficult, often funny and always honest. Episodes offer a nuanced view of people involved with the American prison system and those reintegrating into society after serving time.</p>

We believe that well-crafted, well-told stories can be a catalyst for change for artist and audience alike.

We believe that stories are what bind us to each other.
We want to live in a world driven by empathy.

We host events in and around Chicago that elevate the storyteller’s words to deliver a unique, live, literary/theatrical experience unlike any other in the city. From small bars in Rogers Park and North Center, to big venues in Lakeview and the West Loop, to restaurants in Lincoln Park and Evanston, we produce over 30 events every season and facilitates over 145 artistic collaborations. 

We craft story-sharing experiences in the form of both performances and workshops and classes. A typical show or event consists of several stories dispersed throughout the evening like courses of a meal. The stories range from the earnest and serious to the light-hearted and humorous, and can simultaneously provoke and entertain.

Our venues are as varied as our stories, and run the gamut from intimate wine bars and pubs to spacious performance halls, conference rooms, and open-office environments. Our storytellers are equally diverse, and come from all walks of life: a pastor, a bartender, a child psychiatrist, and a lawyer…their individual stories help to bridge the gap between the personal and the universal, and break down the walls between and unite artists and audiences in and among different communities.",1293791093,https://www.listennotes.com/c/r/c77be4007d55466384e423c03401e58c,1572031990000,1450915200178,English,United States,http://2ndstory.com?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen+Notes&utm_medium=website,False,feeds@soundcloud.com,"[165, 67, 100]"

A wealth of guests—from artists like Rufus Wainwright and Ruben Santiago-Hudson to non-musicians like Dame Judi Dench and Dr. Brooke Magnanti, author of The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl—join Rhiannon and the Met Opera’s singers to understand why these arias touch us at such a human level, well over a century after they were written.

Erin Saxton’s highly-anticipated online TV show, That Girl from Jersey, is now available to the public! Brace yourself for a completely uncensored show as host Erin Saxton expresses her personality and connects with the audience in a less formal way. This is no ordinary “talk show” podcast that bores listeners to death. It’s a fun and exciting podcast for those who can handle the energetic and sometimes humorous nature of her personality. She’ll be interviewing influential guests and discussing interesting topics – everything from current events, funny topics, interesting stories, and much more – with a sprinkle of her New Jersey swag.  Born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Erin had a great childhood full of cheeseburgers, sun chasing, and (rumor has it) a great grandmother who used to work for Thomas Edison. At 49, with a love and passion for connecting with people and making them laugh, she finally got in front of the camera after leaving her behind-the-scenes role helping other people look really good. Erin, That Girl From Jersey, is the Founder of The Erin Network, and she wears a lot of hats. She’s a multi Emmy-nominated and award-winning TV producer, PR maven, brand strategist, keynote speaker, and hockey mom. Having worked on shows that include The View, Barbara Walters Specials, and Good Morning America, she’s been on the receiving end of pitches for years! Through that extensive experience, she was able to carve a niche for consulting and executing effective PR and marketing campaigns for some of the world’s leading companies and entrepreneurs. It is during this time in her career when she became best known for taking an idea and joining it with the perfect plan and team to direct that “winning plan” forward. Today, she takes all that expertise and her passion for interviewing and asking the right questions to deliver repeated successes to her clients that include thought leaders, CEOs, authors, experts, and inventors. We know what you’re thinking. There are over 700,000 podcast shows and over 29 million episodes. Why would she dare jump into the enormous sea of podcasts? For years, people have watched Erin work in the public relations field, often aside some of the biggest celebrities in the world. They’ve watched her bring out the best in people with her pizzazz and one-in-a-million interview style. But this is a little different.  For 25-35 thrilling minutes, you’ll be fully entertained and bursting with laughter, uncontrollable excitement, and anticipation of what will happen next. You’ll be completely sucked into these sizzling hot conversations asking yourself, “Did she really just say that?” But we all know the answer, “YES! She did!” Never been to New Jersey? Don’t worry about it. With a gift and a calling for connecting with people, Erin is bringing Jersey to you — direct from her professional studio every week. Give yourself a break and enjoy this wild and fun journey with Erin and her special guests each week here on That Girl From Jersey!",1482446849,https://www.listennotes.com/c/r/4966444c8b844ff4858315f247bd920f,1573725600000,1569492000014,English,United States,https://www.theerinnetwork.com/that-girl-from-jersey?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen+Notes&utm_medium=website,False,help@podetize.com,"[67, 133, 106, 99, 214, 100, 175]"

The episode of Lord Krishna imparting knowledge to Arjuna occurs in the epic Mahabharata.  There are totally 700 verses classified into 18 chapters.  Krishna gives the essence of the entire Veda in his teaching.   He explains in detail various disciplines like Karma Yoga, Devotion, Values, Meditation, and so on.  Lord Krishna also imparts knowledge about the true nature of God, World and Beings and clearly points out the underlying oneness of God and Beings.
            
            In these 322 classes, all the 700 verses of the Bhagavad Gita are explained word by word, in keeping with Shankaracharya's commentary. These classes will help the listener in gaining a thorough knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita.

The central theme of all the Upanishads is the same, viz., the underlying oneness of Beings and the Lord.  Further, the Upanishads also reveal to us - the qualifications that a student needs to have in order to receive this knowledge; the qualifications essential for a teacher imparting this knowledge; the nature of Liberation; how the world is apparent in nature; and so on.  Each Upanishad explains these in its own unique way. Upanishads, thus, form the philosophical portion of the Vedas.  They are, in general, in the form of a dialogue between a teacher and a student.
            
            One may begin the study of the Upanishads from the Mundaka Upanishad as it is in this Upanishad that the teachings are given in a systematic manner.

      Space does not wish you well. It has no shortage of ways to kill you, and in the fifty years humans have been flying spacecraft around the Earth and out to the moon, the mortal perils have been evident. But ten of the missions were the most harrowing of all. Some of them ended in tragedy, some ended successfully—but all of them involved astronauts playing for the very highest stakes in the very deadliest place.  Countdown tells the tale of those ten missions—some of them American, some Russian. Written and narrated by Jeffrey Kluger—author of Apollo 13 and Apollo 8—Countdown recreates the space crises that every astronaut has feared, and that an unlucky handful were forced to live.

Now you can go inside the mind of one. Someone who went from not being able to break 80, to then become the 16th-best player in the world, and the only man to beat World No. 1 Tiger Woods twice in match play.
Nick O’Hern extracted every ounce of ability from what he’d been given. Proving, even if you aren’t the most physically gifted golfer, you can still compete with anyone if you’re mentally tough. That’s the secret that allowed him to forge a successful career in a sport that’s one of the toughest to do so, and it’s the secret he offers in these pages.

      <p>We’ve entered a new era. The creation and collection of information play an ever-increasing — yet often hidden — role in our lives. Algorithms filter all sorts of experiences, from the mundane to the monumental. The fuel that powers and curates these experiences is…data. Data are the new oil; whoever controls data has power. Is this making things better? Worse? Raw Data is a show about <strong>how information becomes power</strong>. What are the implications for all of us, now that mountains of data are more accessible and malleable than ever?</p>

She’s the only woman on the homicide squad, and a skilled chameleon: undercover cop in vice stings, crime-scene commander, patient confidante of killers. A master interrogator, she invokes her personal experience – and deepest griefs – as a tool to elicit confessions. When a young woman’s body is found at a trash-sorting plant, Trapp learns the murder may be linked to the disappearance of three other women in nearby Santa Ana. Trapp embarks on a dark journey that brings her face to face with a man who takes “a little piece of her soul.” The series is about a singular detective on a relentless, sometimes lonely quest for answers.</p><p>From the Los Angeles Times and Wondery, “Detective Trapp” is a new story from Christopher Goffard, the writer and host of “Dirty John.”</p>

Since then it continues to enjoy immense acclaim and popularity as a coming of age allegory where a nonconformist youngster is transformed into a responsible citizen. 

The most appealing aspect of White Fang is that it's told from the point of view of an animal, in this case an Alaskan Husky. Like Black Beauty by Anna Sewell, White Fang also addresses ethical  issues, social injustices and cruelty to our four footed friends. 

Set in the harsh environment of Canada's Yukon territory, White Fang tells the gripping tale of a young half breed pup, born of a wild mother who is herself half dog, half wolf. The bloody battles for survival among the denizens of this frozen land are wonderfully depicted. As a pup, White Fang and his mother, One-Eye, survive vicious attacks by other wolves and a vengeful lynx whose kittens were killed by One-Eye. Once, while roaming close to a Native Indian encampment, One-Eye is recognized by Grey Beaver, a young hunter whose dead brother had tamed her many years ago. Grey Beaver adopts the young pup and names him White Fang.

At the encampment, White Fang is a misfit among the dogs and pups reared there. He turns into a vicious, resentful, aggressive and solitary rebel. Lip-lip, the leader of the dog pack relentlessly bullies and torments White Fang. Finally, Grey Beaver trades White Fang to a dog fighter, where his combative nature leads him to a successful but hazardous career. In the midst of a savage fight, White Fang is nearly killed, but a young prospector Weedon Scott intervenes. The rest of this exciting novel traces White Fang's move to sunny California and his interesting adventures there. 

The story, though it has an animal as the hero, is reputedly based on Jack London's own colorful life and career. As a front runner in establishing the cult of fiction written for commercial magazines, London also led an eventful life as a journalist, social activist and passionate advocate of human rights. He traveled round the world as a hobo on steamships and schooners and even joined the Klondike Gold Rush where he found rich material for his writings. 

White Fang is a riveting, poignant and very dramatic story that, along with its unforgettable hero, will appeal to readers of all ages.

It’s a behind the scenes look at the marketing tactics and strategies that lead to a loyal following, growing sales and a business that gives you (the business owner) more freedom in your everyday life.  Each episode will be short, punchy and packed with takeaways to help you get what you have, in front of a lot more people.  It’s about leveraging your marketing to build a business that is high in profit, low in stress and one that gives you the ability and freedom to have the greatest impact on the world.  

Join leading online marketing strategist and entrepreneur, Stu McLaren, as he shares what’s working selling products online with product launches, online communities, email marketing,  social media marketing, content marketing, pay per click marketing and so much more.  This is about the marketing that leads to more sales, more profits and a high growth business.  

With that said, this show is not just about making money.  It’s about using the power of marketing to give you more freedom. The freedom to work with who you want, where you want while having the time to travel and do all the things you want. It’s about reducing the “go-go-go” stress and instead redesigning your business so you can be more present in the lives of those that matter most to you. To laugh more, live more and to create a real difference in the world.
 
For years, Stu McLaren has helped experts transform their knowledge and influence into recurring revenue by launching, growing and scaling 7 and 8-figure membership sites. In 2008, he co-founded the world’s most popular membership platform for WordPress (WishList Member). He then went on to partner with New York Times best-selling author Michael Hyatt, helping his company go from a high 6-figure business (with lots of stress) to a high 7-figure business (with low-stress). Michael’s profitability soared, his email list grew from 70,000 to over 500,000 and he gained back over 100 days with his family by not having to travel.
 
Today, Stu coaches and consults other elite level entrepreneurs, experts and influencers, who want the same kind of growth without the stress or tension of neglecting the things that matter most. So, if you’ve got an established business and you’re looking for ideas on how you can get your products and services in front of more people OR you’re someone who is thinking about starting a business and you want to see the behind the scenes of another entrepreneur doing it in in real time, the Marketing Your Business podcast is a show that is tailor made for you.",1299443864,https://www.listennotes.com/c/r/1cf50b0806114573af27c273015f2809,1574244000000,1507668986116,English,United States,http://marketingyourbusiness.com?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen+Notes&utm_medium=website,False,stu@stu.me,"[67, 93, 97, 111, 115]"

      <p>Is it just me or is time flying by? How do we make the most out of our short time here on Earth? That’s what we’re here to find out. I’m Justin Long and I’ve been an actor for most of my life, so I’m used to getting inside the heads of the characters I play. But now that I’m getting older (I’m 41 now, yikes), I want to peek inside the heads of real people to learn how they find meaning in life. I’m also very curious what their favorite snack food is, and what emoji they use most often — ya know, the REALLY important stuff. Every episode I’ll get personal with all kinds of people, from actors to musicians to deep thinkers who fascinate me. My brother Christian is on hand each episode to keep me honest, and occasionally remind me about some of the embarrassing things I’ve done over the years. Join us, or if you have more important things to do, that’s okay too — life is short! </p>

The podcast is narrated by Eleanor Reissa, actress and Yiddish theater director, and historical oversight by Professor Samuel Kassow.

“Those Who Were There” podcast features audio from videotaped interviews conducted between 1979 up to the present. ""Back in 1979, video was regarded as a remarkable, groundbreaking technology for documenting the experiences of survivors. The testimonies that resulted were and remain very powerful,” said Stephen Naron, director of the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies. “Today, by adapting our holdings to the podcast format, we have an opportunity to bring these intimate personal accounts of Holocaust survivors and witnesses to a world-wide listenership. After all, only a fraction of our more than 4,400 testimonies have ever been viewed. Every voice, every story is important, and the podcast is a chance to provide a public space for each survivor, one episode at a time.”
The podcast’s first season will feature 10 episodes, including accounts from Jewish survivors, non-Jewish witnesses and liberators. The memories shared express a wide range of experiences before, during and after the Second World War by those who experienced it. Still, it is only a small glimpse into the thousands of stories held in this diverse archive.

It follows the events during the night of the affluent Billings family annual dinner party with their distinguished, eccentric guests. However, all is not fun and games as shortly after the party starts, a snowstorm begins to rage outside, trapping all the partygoers inside their host’s mansion. When a murderer starts killing off those in attendance, the guests must figure out who is responsible, or at least how to stay alive -- lest they be next.

Deadly Manners was created by Ali Garfinkel and Alex Aldea.

Deadly Manners stars Kristen Bell, Denis O'Hare, Alisha Boe, RuPaul, Anna Chlumsky, Timothy Simons, Michelle Visage, Alona Tal, David Cummings and is narrated by LeVar Burton.

His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station.

Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that.

Hudson was round two of IVF and Mila round ten.  

After completing her family, Tasha used her experience as well as her background in sciences to solve what gets in the way of a successful pregnancy.  All of the answers were a sum of the right Science, enough Space (clear that bulky emotional and physical clutter!) and enough Energy (these cells have to keep reproducing and growing.)  

Her integrative program, the FU Project Workshop, provides a customized blueprint for any woman trying to get or stay pregnant with a guarantee of her work. 

Recognized as an influencer in the fertility arena, Tasha's achievements with ""The FU Project"" has earned her the label of 'industry disruptor'.  And that is her goal.  To help balance the risk/reward equation between the patient and the provider which is extremely lopsided right now.  Tasha knows that if she can educate the patient,  the fertility provider has to proceed with more transparency and accountability.   

The FU Project Workshop's global reach is helping women get educated and empowered before jumping into their fertility journey.

But it does not stop there.  

Once these are pregnant and have a baby, the FU Project continues to support women and provide tools to ensure that they have enough Space and Energy for calm abundance in every area of their lives.  This is very hard to do with children.  

All content is based on science and is presented with an unfiltered, raw, humorous tone.

It's the podcast that encourages you to let go of material things and clear out your space to make room for what matters. Believe it or not, your stuff takes up your time, and cluttered spaces can be a source of anxiousness. Fill your life with the people and things that you love, and get rid of the rest. Through conversations with other women and moms on the same simple-living journey, the Minimal-ish podcast will encourage you towards the grace-filled, realistic form of minimalism that benefits your life and family most. 

But it's not just about getting rid of your stuff or tidying up your home. There's so much more. Minimalism allows you to make room to live the life you want. This podcast discusses how to live the intentional life you want to live through simplifying in every area- how to make room so you can tell the story you want to tell with the life you've been given. 

Your host, Desirae Endres, is a stay at home/ work at home mom, teacher, and writer that believes that minimalism and having an uncluttered home environment can benefit everyone, but it doesn't look the same for everyone. Minimalism has changed her life, and if she can make minimalism attainable and sustainable in her life, anyone can. She brings honesty and transparency to the conversation as an admittedly (formerly-ish) unorganized, messy and anxious person as she discusses topics of minimalism, intentional, creative  living, motherhood, and more.
